The Galaxy Z Fold 8 might end up getting this creaseless panel that was shown off at CES this year. Android Central's Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda was able to compare the "reference device" — what looks to be a current-gen foldable — and the upcoming panel that seemingly looks to be creaseless. Some people even speculate that this creaseless screen will debut on Apple's rumored book-style foldable set to launch this year. <br><br>Jonnalagadda says that Samsung didn't indicate whether this panel would end up on the Galaxy Z Fold 8, but it is entirely likely that it will be the case, considering it showcased the tri-folding panels at MWC last year, and we saw it on the Galaxy Z Trifold this year.</p><h2 id="motorola-entered-ces-this-year-with-the-most-flex-2">Motorola entered CES this year with the most flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/meet-the-razr-fold-ces-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/unveiling-the-motorola-signature-launches-ces-2026"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Motorola outdid itself at CES this year, unveiling a whole slew of devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a>. The phone shows up with a 6.6-inch cover display like any other device, but unfolds into a massive 8.1-inch 2K LTPO display that lets the user juggle between work, creativity, and play. Motorola didn't reveal much about the device's dimensions, chipset, or other internal specs, like the RAM and battery.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Fold features an advanced triple rear camera system consisting of a 50MP Sony LYTIA main sensor, a 50MP ultrawide/macro lens, and a 50MP 3x periscope telephoto lens. It also gets two selfie cameras, a 32MP external camera, and a 20MP punch hole camera on its internal screen, for when the device is unfolded.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-signature-hands-on">Motorola Signature</a>, which is an ultra-slim device, featuring a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor, 50MP cameras, and a remarkable 5,200mAh battery—all encased in a sleek design, starting at €999, and is the first phone that is said to get upto seven years of software updates.</p><p>Other than these phones, the company also<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-things-hits-the-new-year-with-an-ultra-stylus-for-the-razr-fold-at-ces-2026"> unveiled a trio of innovative accessories</a>, including the Pen Ultra stylus for its Razr Fold, a feature-rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-the-moto-watch-and-im-glad-motorola-ditched-wear-os">Moto Watch</a> partnered with Polar, and the Moto Tag 2 tracker, promising to redefine user experience and convenience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="galaxy-s26-leaks-keep-leaking-with-rumors-of-a-feb-launch-2">Galaxy S26 leaks keep leaking, with rumors of a Feb launch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-may-revolutionize-charging-with-new-60w-system-heres-the-scoop"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's next flagship series has been showing up in multiple leaks recently, and for good reason, considering it's due to launch sometime next month. We've heard a ton about the device lineup reshuffle, with the Ultra possibly showing up with four cameras; the leaks keep getting better.</p><p>Prominent tipster Evan Blass took to X, stating that the February 25 date is "100% correct" for the Galaxy S26 series launch. Blass was quoting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2006658430468239377" target="_blank">post from @UniverseIce</a>, which mentioned that Samsung will not be changing Galaxy S26 pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-entire-galaxy-s26-series-could-cost-usd50-more-than-the-galaxy-s25">as previously rumored</a>. That same post also claimed the launch will take place in San Francisco, U.S., with sales beginning in early March.</p><p>In a subsequent post, Ice Universe also claimed that the Galaxy S26 Ultra could get a huge upgrade when it comes to its fast charging system. In a post on X, the tipster claims that the phone will get support for a new 60W charging system, which will be capable of charging the phone from 0 to 75% within 30 minutes.</p><p>Backing this claim, they further stated that the tests for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's charging capabilities were conducted under Samsung's controlled laboratory conditions, using certified accessories and settings.</p><h2 id="google-is-gemini-fying-everything-from-tv-to-your-inbox-2">Google is Gemini-fying everything from TV to your inbox</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV" name="Gmail AI Inbox Demo" alt="Gmail's new AI Inbox feature in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-set-to-transform-your-google-tv"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/google-announces-major-gmail-gemini-powered-upgrades"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google also didn't shy away from making its own set of announcements for its products. First up, Google unveiled Gemini for Google TV, the AI assistant that transforms user interaction with smart features, including photo memory searches and interactive content, debuting first on select TCL models and set to reshape home entertainment.</p><p>Users will be able to ask the TV, "How do black holes work?" or "Who were the Vikings?" and it will give you "Deep dives" on the topic with interactive summaries that both adults and kids can understand.</p><p>Additionally, it is transforming Gmail with Gemini’s advanced AI tools, enhancing email management through personalized responses and innovative summaries. The most significant change is that Gmail is getting AI Overviews that let users ask natural language questions and receive concise summaries from emails.</p><h2 id="some-pixel-9-and-10-users-are-feeling-sluggish-laggy-after-this-update-2">Some Pixel 9 and 10 users are feeling "Sluggish & Laggy" after this update</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn" name="Google-Pixel-10-At-a-Glance" alt="The At a Glance widget on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3410" height="1917" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/two-generations-of-google-pixel-flagships-seem-sluggish-after-update"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Another month and another bug seems to be plaguing some Pixel users right now, after a Play Systems update. Following a small 15MB patch, users saw issues with a Pixel 10, which appeared to be the most affected device. The main problem was that the phone became very sluggish, and the Pixel launcher reportedly "did not fully load."</p><p>The device's screen remained stuck, only displaying the wallpaper without the essential UI elements. Furthermore, some even observed that the device's status bar was also missing and apps would freeze, or display the "not responding" error post this update.</p><p>However, Google quietly rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-is-getting-another-update-and-its-to-fix-some-annoying-issues">an essential (emergency) update</a> that fixed it all.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

On paper, they're a fascinating alternative to options like Garmin's daily suggested workouts — though not long-term plans like Garmin Coach, TrainingPeaks, or Strava's own Runna plans.</p><p>Garmin's daily suggestions for runners or cyclists rely on training load focus data, pushing you to do more low-aerobic or anaerobic workouts to sustain a good chronic load. Strava is counting on athletes to decide for themselves when they need to push harder, ease off, or maintain, with more suggestions at any given moment.</p><p>Garmin has only recently expanded its workout suggestions to indoor strength training on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a>, and it's worth noting that only <em>some</em> Garmin watches have suggestions in general. Strava's workouts target a wider variety of sports, and even if you can only "push" them to Apple and Garmin watches, you could easily recreate "run 3 miles in 30 minutes" on your own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>.</p><p>As a side note, I'm curious to see how well Strava's Heatmap-generated routes work. Garmin's own Trendline Popularity routing has never built especially <em>useful</em> or <em>intelligent</em> courses for me; I've always tended to make my own routes, if I use them at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-workout-plan" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Fitness tab open; it shows a customized workout plan with three upcoming runs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth comparing Strava Instant Workouts to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a>, which creates custom workout suggestions across a couple dozen sports modes.</p><p>Currently in a public preview, the new Fitbit app has you speak to an LLM "coach" about your workout goals, at which point it auto-generates a week of workouts at a time. You only see one per day, but you can always "adjust plan" and change your specific workout for the day.</p><p>Fitbit doesn't have a Heatmap GPS equivalent, but its "AI" analysis is attempting something similar to Strava's Athlete Intelligence, except designed to be more of a conversation instead of Strava's per-workout summaries.</p><p>Ultimately, it's no surprise that Strava challenged other apps with its own personalized workouts. It knew it needed to be more "forward-looking" and offer more coaching value to keep its subscribers happy. And its Instant Workouts" are well-suited to Strava users, who won't want to be tied to a specific device or have to build and stick to a long-term workout plan. Always-available, tailored workouts on your phone will be more compelling to casual athletes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> was a great example of this, offering flagship specs that rivaled (and in some ways bested) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">Galaxy S23 Plus</a> but for hundreds less.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9" name="Motorola-edge-plus-2023-hands-on-display-04.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I expect Motorola to apply the same ethos to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold">Razr Fold</a>.

While Motorola has yet to officially provide any pricing details, that would already undercut most new book-style foldables, which often start at $1,800 in the U.S. Even with the potential concern over losing a major U.S. carrier, that's still an attractive price.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some good news and bad news regarding Moto.

They offer a unique ability to be used as a traditional phone with the added advantage of opening up to a "tablet-like" experience with a much larger display. However, they usually measure a meager 8 inches and have a more square aspect ratio, which doesn't exactly scream "tablet."</p><p>That's not to say the larger displays on these foldables aren't useful, but the experience still feels confined compared to a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p><p>As a remedy to this shortcoming, the Galaxy Z TriFold takes that concept and runs with it, opening up to a full 10-inch display. This size is on the lower end of most tablets, which are often 10 or 11 inches, while still providing a more tablet-like aspect ratio that we don't see on bi-fold foldables. The result is a more versatile experience that should proove more useful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung also took it further by letting the TriFold run a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifolds-best-feature-wont-be-its-hardware-heres-why-im-more-excited-for-dex">standalone DeX mode</a>, meaning you won't need an external display to make it work, just like on its tablets.

The Galaxy A17 5G also stands apart from other budget phones by offering six years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><p>Now, I don't need to tell you that buying a $200 phone is going to come with some sacrifices. 4GB of RAM isn't a lot, and you're limited to the 128GB storage configuration. In other words, if you're a heavy data user, the A17 may not be the best fit.</p><p>But if you want a cheap 2026 phone that <em>feels like a 2026 phone</em>, the Galaxy A17 5G is going to be a solid choice. Pull it out the next time your friends are showing off their fancy new flagships and I guarantee no one will notice the difference.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the digital data company's analytics, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-now-integrates-seamlessly-with-notebooklm-for-improved-project-management">Google's Gemini</a> has reached 21.5% of the traffic share as of January 2, 2026. What's leading the race? OpenAI's ChatGPT with 64.5% of the traffic share. There's one clear fact here, per Similarweb's data: ChatGPT and Gemini are the "top dogs," one might say, for traffic.</p><p>Among the many AI names, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini account for ~86% of the traffic. The remaining 14% is divvied up between DeepSeek, X's Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Microsoft's Copilot (in order).</p><p>Even when we get down into AI tools traffic, ChatGPT and Gemini still lead the pack, though the former holds the majority.</p><p>What's interesting about where Gemini is now is that it's been gaining ground (slowly, but surely) over the past few months. In actuality, it's been a trend all throughout 2025. Similarweb's timeline shows how Gemini's traffic share has been slowly rising, going from 5.7% a year ago to 18.2% in December 2025.</p><h2 id="gemini-v-chatgpt-2">Gemini v.

OpenAI's ChatGPT came out of left field, but it's how the general public views that Gen AI chatbot, as opposed to every other company's version. When ChatGPT debuted, it stunned and retained users, reaching 700 million monthly active users.</p><p>This is when Google started making shifts toward Gemini, and then, Apple started to wiggle itself into the mix. Here's the thing: everyone was playing catch-up. While most companies are still playing catch-up, Gemini's doing so at a seemingly faster rate, at least, per the data.</p><p>Google and OpenAI aren't slowing down one bit, as the former introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-set-to-transform-your-google-tv">Gemini features for its TV service</a>, turning it into another companion. For OpenAI, the company recently introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/health-focus-openais-waitlist-for-chatgpt-healths-dedicated-wellness-guidance-opens">ChatGPT Health</a>, a dedicated chatting experience with its AI that can help users with medical records and app data.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are two huge talking points here, so things kick off with Lock Glimpse, as Nothing is removing the feature entirely. The post states that the feature will disappear from the Nothing Phone a Series, except for the Lite.</p><p>Nothing says it has made the decision "based on feedback" and that it will only return Lock Glimpse to devices "once it’s meaningfully improved to feel less intrusive and more considered."</p><p>The other major side of this Friday update is bloatware. Nothing states users can now "fully remove" the Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Service from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-3a-lite-debuts">Phone 3a lite</a>. Entering the setting's page for the app and tapping "Disable" is how you get the ball rolling. After disabling, Nothing says your device will prompt you to restart. It adds that once this reboot concludes, "all Meta services are removed from the system partition."</p><p>The post notes that if you factory reset your device, these Meta services will return.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, Nothing is adding "app recommendations." This feature is stated to be a part of your device's setup experience; however, it may also appear "after certain updates." The post says that users can easily dismiss these notifications by swiping them away. A more permanent fix would be to disable it completely: <strong>Settings > Apps > All apps > Top-right icon > Show system > App Services > Disable</strong>.</p><p>These recommendations are headed for Nothing Phone a Series and CMF phones. The company states it's also looking to bring support for uninstalling App Services, like Meta's services, in a future OTA for more phones.</p><h2 id="solving-problems-one-at-a-time-2">Solving problems, one at a time</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5135px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="kZXcSzFUgFcN3cpBUhWTRR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZXcSzFUgFcN3cpBUhWTRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5135" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users raised their voices about a problem late last year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-dials-it-back-vows-to-give-users-a-way-to-remove-that-heavy-bloatware">the heavy bloatware</a> needs to go. Nothing faced backlash over its OS 4.0 software after users discovered instances of bloatware, such as Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services. The company highlighted that it previously only let users disable such apps, but offering a true removal option is exactly what users were chasing.</p><p>This was something Nothing alluded to during the Open Beta, stating that it would pre-install "partner apps and services" to help its BOM costs (Bill of Materials).

Fortunately, many of the best wireless carriers in the biz run special limited time offers this time of year, and the Verizon-owned Visible Wireless is no exception.</p><p>Sign up today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><strong>with the promo code SWITCH26 at checkout and you could save up to $12 per month for 26 months. </strong></a>That may not sound like a lot, but Visible's plans were already pretty affordable, so this deal could seriously alter the way you view your phone bill in 2026 (and beyond).

Using the code <strong>SWITCH26</strong> at checkout knocks $6, $9, and $12 off the Visible Basic, Visible Plus, and Visible Plus Pro plans, respectively, and the deal locks in the discounted rate for over two years with no hidden fees whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.06%;"><img id="JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z" name="visivle-app-on-phone.jpg" alt="Visible app on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In other words, if you use the deal to save $12 per month on the Visible Plus Pro plan, you're basically getting six months of Verizon-powered wireless for FREE across 26 months. That plan also gives you unlimited premium data on Verizon's Ultra Wideband network, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and uncapped coverage to over 85 countries worldwide.</p><p>Even if you go with one of the Visible's less comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">data plans</a>, you'll still get unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's legendary network, a free mobile hotspot, discounts on home internet, and much more.</p><h2 id="why-should-i-switch-to-visible-2">Why should I switch to Visible?</h2><p>Visible Wireless is unique in that it offers the convenience and flexibility of a prepaid carrier with the support and coverage of a Big Three provider. There are only three straightforward plans to choose from, and all three offer unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's vast 5G network. There are no hidden fees to worry about, unlimited hotspot data is a given, and the fact that Verizon owns and operates the carrier means that de-prioritization is uncommon.</p><h2 id="does-visible-wireless-have-a-free-trial-2">Does Visible Wireless have a free trial?</h2><p>Yes! Visible Wireless offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/free-trial"><strong>a 15-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore the ins and outs of its service with zero hassle or commitment.

An interview with Disney Entertainment and ESPN's EVP of product management, Erin Teague, said, "everything’s on the table" regarding these vertical videos. The original announcement said that these videos would be used to "explore" its uses across "categories, and content types, for a personalized and dynamic feed."</p><p>Disney might even look to throw in news and other entertainment tidbits throughout the day.</p><p>On a technical level, Teague said Disney is still in its early stages, as it looks to implement vertical videos in a way that doesn't feel "disjointed." However, for the user, Deadline highlights that these vertical videos could contain original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles," and more.</p><p>These videos would try and have their own backbone and not just be a "teaser" for Disney Plus' "long-form" content, such as movies and shows.</p><h2 id="getting-in-on-the-short-form-2">Getting in on the short-form</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="vvvsiZBtujJEGQMYqQtMGd" name="youtube-shorts-hero.jpg" alt="Youtube Shorts Hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvvsiZBtujJEGQMYqQtMGd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the report, one of the catalysts behind Disney's interest in vertical videos is its Gen Z and Gen Alpha users. Teague adds that, "This is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha are expecting. They are not necessarily thinking about sitting down, watching a long-form, two-and-a-half hour piece of content on their phones." More than that, Teague's response gives the impression that Disney Plus is caught in this whirlwind of engagement from other platforms with short-form, vertical videos.</p><p>You can think YouTube Shorts, Reels on Instagram, and even "Verts" on ESPN, which the publication makes note of. We shouldn't expect these vertical videos on Disney Plus anytime soon, as the company hashes out the finer details.</p><p>Aside from bringing in Hulu content more prominently on Disney Plus, vertical videos are probably the largest content shift users can expect on the service. Besides that, the card we were dealt back in September <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus/disney-plus-preparing-to-raise-prices-on-standalone-bundled-plans">was a price hike (again)</a> for its standalone and bundled plans. October 21 is when the price hikes went live for its basic with ads plan and its Premium variant. Prices hopped up by $2 to $3.</p><p>Even the Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max bundles rose from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With each charge, Google says the buds themselves will net users up to 12 hours of playtime, while intermittent charges with the case can help them last up to 48 hours between case charges.</p><p>They also have Qi wireless charging, access to SBC and AAC lossless codecs, and the latest in Google's Gemini AI features across the company's device ecosystem.</p><p>To be sure, these will probably leave something to be desired for users who don't already have Pixel devices, though they'll still offer a really crisp, clear audio profile that users will like. For $165, they do seem like a pretty appealing upgrade for those who are already within the Pixel ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When it comes to filtering out content, YouTube says it's making the process simpler this week. Two options are out: Upload Date - Last Hour and Sort by Rating. While important filtering choices, YouTube says users can achieve the same end by utilizing an "Upload Date" option and the "Popularity" filter choice.</p><p>With the house cleaning done, the more substantial portion of this update concerns new filters and some subtle changes.</p><p>YouTube states that, for "dedicated content types," it's rolled in a Shorts filter to the "Type" menu. If Shorts is selected, of course, the search results will prioritize those over long-form video content. It also makes sense that YouTube would bring Shorts here, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-shorts-five-trillion-total-views">how incredibly popular</a> they are with viewers.</p><p>As for the changes, YouTube says it's renaming the "Sort By" menu to "Prioritize." This is designed to attract more attention and hopefully drive more engagement for users looking to fine-tune their content. Second, the "View Count" filter is now "Popularity." The goal here is to help users discover video content that's hot, popping, and relevant to their initial query. Watch time and view count are taken into account during this search process.</p><p>These updates are slowly rolling out, so users may begin seeing them soon. We have not seen them appear yet at Android Central; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/08/youtube-search-filters/">9to5Google</a> has spotted them.</p><h2 id="the-content-you-want-to-see-2">The content you want to see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of refining content discovery in search results, YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-shorts-starts-a-new-dislike-test-so-it-can-better-gauge-your-interests">started a test before 2025's end</a> for Shorts. This test was in a similar vein, as the platform started testing a "dislike" button change for users. The thumbs down button was often an object of mystery for some users, so YouTube said it merged "dislike" and "not interested" into one button.</p><p>The platform said that, in its research, most users used the two buttons "interchangeably." Moreover, users weren't really sure about the differences between the two. The test would offer users one option or the other (dislike or not interested). YouTube states that users would see a short survey after hitting the thumbs-down button.</p><p>The purpose of this button is to help users weed out the type of content they'd rather not see, which can happen from time to time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We've heard a ton about the device lineup reshuffle, with the Ultra possibly showing up with four cameras; the leaks keep getting better.</p><p>The most recent one comes from reliable tipster Ice Universe, who is super certain about the S26 Ultra's new charging speeds. According to them, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could get a huge upgrade when it comes to its fast charging system. In a post on X, the tipster claims that the phone will get support for a new 60W charging system, which will be capable of charging the phone from 0 to 75% within 30 minutes.</p><p>This is incredible because, if a phone can reach that high a percentage of charge within a short span of time, it could dramatically reduce downtime for those who are stuck to their phone all day, or are travelling.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive:！Official test results for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra’s all-new 60W charging show it can charge from 0 to 75% in 30 minutes.These results were tested under Samsung’s controlled conditions.

That said, all these fast charging claims are also highly reliant on real-world factors such as ambient temperature, battery health, and device usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this leak holds, then the Galaxy S26 Ultra would definitely be a significant upgrade from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">predecessor, which supports only 45W</a> of wired charging, taking upto an hour to charge completely. Faster charging speeds have become a key factor to consider when it comes to picking a new phone, since you wouldn't want to be stuck to the plug for longer hours.</p><p>That said, the Galaxy S26 Ultra appears to be introducing some new features this year, including the rumored yet nifty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display">privacy display</a>.

This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/">it announced</a> ChatGPT Health, "a dedicated experience in ChatGPT designed for health and wellness." The company states this new dedicated way of using ChatGPT was a direct result of how users already lean on the AI. OpenAI states, "Health is already one of the most common ways people use" the AI with "millions of people asking health and wellness questions each week."</p><p>ChatGPT Health takes into account all of your submitted wellness information to help you understand the finer details. OpenAI says users can submit their medical records and data from health apps, like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal.</p><p>As you might expect, OpenAI makes it clear that ChatGPT is not intended to <em>replace </em>your doctor; it's simply there to aid your understanding. With that in mind, after you've given the AI your records and app data, ChatGPT can help answer questions you may have about your results, set up future appointments, and offer guidance for workouts and diet.</p><p>OpenAI states that it has created ChatGPT Health alongside licensed physicians. The post states that these physicians have also encouraged OpenAI to provide different levels of the AI's responses. From how condensed information is delivered for better understanding to how urgently it should push users to seek their doctor.</p><h2 id="understand-what-matters-most-2">Understand what matters most</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ_BMwB647A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Uploading sensitive information, such as your medical records, is undoubtedly a fright for many users. To help, OpenAI says ChatGPT Health has received "foundational protections" to safeguard users' data and to give users control over it. Users will have access to temporary chats, the option to remove data from OpenAI's systems within 30 days, and more.</p><p>ChatGPT Health has also been trained not to retain users' personal information from chats.</p><p>For your medical records, the files themselves are encrypted when moving and when at rest. More than that, OpenAI says there are layered protections, as well as isolation. Essentially, conversations taking place in ChatGPT Health will "not be used" to train OpenAI's foundation models.</p><p>As previously stated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/health/waitlist?openaicom_referred=true">users can sign up</a> for ChatGPT Health's waitlist to hopefully gain entry.</p><p>OpenAI is already looking to future updates, stating, "We’ll continue to expand what you can connect and the insights Health can support—so ChatGPT can help you feel more informed, prepared, and confident as you navigate your health."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Their purpose was to discuss the company's shift, moving ChromeOS to a new Android-based stack called AluminumOS in November.

Due to its scale, dropping the software isn't possible. Software support was another object of concern, to which Maletis confirms that the 10-year commitment isn't vanishing.</p><p>He states that this shift into an Android-based stack is more of an "evolution" for ChromeOS, rather than Google phasing it out.</p><p>Toward the discussion's end, Maletis told ChromeUnboxed that there might be some variation between devices utilizing AluminumOS and the standard ChromeOS we know.

These clever cardboard contraptions have gamers start by assembling a unique controller, then using it in a bespoke game. One of these LABO kits was a VR headset.</p><p>While LABO is no longer made, the VR functionality in games like Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and several other games remains. Now that the Switch 2 is out with more powerful hardware, a higher-resolution screen, and upgraded versions of <em>all</em> these games, it makes sense to me to give them another shot in VR.</p><p>So I went and ordered the best-looking Switch 2-compatible VR headset from Amazon and got to downloading the Switch 2 updates for all the games that support VR mode. While the concept of offering hybrid VR functionality in AAA Nintendo games is an excellent concept, the execution still leaves a lot to be desired.</p><h2 id="setup-is-simple-but-it-doesn-t-get-much-better-from-there-2">Setup is simple, but it doesn't get much better from there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NQvRVR5AmWDrYq3cXwDodU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-captain-toad" alt="The STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 running Captain Toad Treasure Tracker in VR mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQvRVR5AmWDrYq3cXwDodU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above is the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2. It's one of many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=startrc+switch+2+vr+headset&crid=3NQ14XR8GXSEN&sprefix=startrc+switch+2+vr+headse%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_noss">identical-looking headset accessories</a> for Nintendo's system, and, unsurprisingly, none of them seem to be available for purchase now. At least they'll have one unit once mine is returned.</p><p>I've been a VR gamer for over a decade now and, from everything I can tell, this is as good as Switch 2 VR headsets get. It's got pads for your head and face in the right locations, adjustable lenses that can correct for IPD and mild focusing issues, and a proper place for the Switch 2 to be docked. It's better than LABO if, for no other reason, you don't have to hold it up to your face the entire time.</p><p>But that's where the positive traits end. Firing up BOTW, Mario Odyssey, or Captain Toad in VR for the first time promises to be glorious, but with this hardware, you shouldn't bother trying it at all.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LY67fJb3TrhqjnnjAVLfXU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-lenses" alt="The lenses of the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LY67fJb3TrhqjnnjAVLfXU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HYPZUDQnhdRYb4W63noKcU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-adjustment-wheels" alt="The lens adjustment wheels on the underside of the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYPZUDQnhdRYb4W63noKcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v7z4jxCRTrHnzNPCGNyVYU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-side" alt="A STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 inserted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7z4jxCRTrHnzNPCGNyVYU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vge5X4DqgymxaxDVfQFdcU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-inside" alt="The STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vge5X4DqgymxaxDVfQFdcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YMd2mXxKgsp43Ws5Nfby9U" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-top" alt="A STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 inserted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YMd2mXxKgsp43Ws5Nfby9U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I'm not someone who gets dizzy or motion sick from VR, but I could feel the head pressure immediately as soon as I put this headset on.

Now available at most big box stores in North America, the phone is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset (making it faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>), plus you get a IP69K durability rating with a stunning 6.78-inch 165Hz flat OLED display.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 also boasts a gargantuan 7,300mAh battery that provides up to three days of battery life on a single charge, and the camera tech could easily holds its own against the best devices from Samsung or Google.</p><p>So what are the downsides? Well, it makes the most sense to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">compare the OnePlus 15 with its most obvious rival</a>, the aforementioned Galaxy S25 Ultra. For starters, the OnePlus 15 only has six years of guaranteed OS upgrades compared to Samsung's seven, and the OEM has never been as interested in AI integration as Samsung and Google seem to be.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gR2eudhfwd6L3yKgEBTW3b" name="oneplus-15-display-home-screen-02" alt="A customized home screen UI on the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gR2eudhfwd6L3yKgEBTW3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> also comes with a built-in stylus and a larger display, and one could argue that the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera system is a bit more versatile than the OnePlus' tech. On the other hand, the OnePlus 15 wins out with battery life, charging speeds, and its lightweight build.</p><p>For most folks, the decision will come down to price. Is it worth spending $300 more to get marginally better AI features and software support? It's totally your call, but if you want to branch out beyond the confines of Samsung and Google and save a little cash in the process, the OnePlus 15 is the best of the best.

Colors were assigned to lights without knowing their actual spots. For example, a lamp behind your couch might shine as brightly as a ceiling light across the room, which could ruin the effect Hue wanted. Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.</p><p>Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed. Instead of treating each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-light-bulb">smart bulb</a> as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light. It then spreads colors and brightness in a way that copies how light works in real life.</p><p>The Hue app uses augmented reality and asks you to scan your room with your phone or tablet. This scan builds a model that shows where each light is, including floor lamps, wall lights, and ceiling fixtures. After that, an algorithm takes over and arranges scenes so every light fits in naturally.</p><p>If you add new lights later, just scan the area again and the room model updates on its own.</p><h2 id="nature-scenes-get-the-biggest-upgrade-2">Nature scenes get the biggest upgrade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NpE6dw8YFjh5tzWc2K8yiK" name="Philips-Hue-Spatial-Aware" alt="Philips Hue spatial aware lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpE6dw8YFjh5tzWc2K8yiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Signify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most noticeable upgrade is in Hue’s nature-inspired scenes. About half of the updated Scene Gallery will work with SpatialAware at launch, including options like Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.</p><p>In practice, if you choose a sunset-style scene, lights on one side of the room glow with warm yellows, while lights across the room turn deeper and darker. You can still use the classic scene mode if you want, but after seeing SpatialAware, the difference is clear.</p><p>Philips Hue says the feature is built for Bridge Pro users, framing it as a premium experience that leans heavily on smarter processing and room awareness.</p><p>Bridge Pro is also becoming more flexible. Now, users can combine several Bridges into one Bridge Pro setup, with the only limit being the hardware’s capacity.</p><p>Hue’s AI assistant is also getting better. Now, you can ask it to create automations using natural language, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. It’s also adding more language support and learning how to guide users to the right troubleshooting help when problems come up.</p><p>Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users. Most of the other upgrades will arrive between now and the first quarter of 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the camera experience looks identical on paper until you notice one thing: the telephoto lens and OIS system.</p><p>That 200MP telephoto sensor might be the same as last year's, but it's behind a brand-new CIPA 5.5 OIS system that delivers the best results I've ever seen from a telephoto lens. It's got incredible depth and bokeh that most phone sensors simply can't produce without using software portrait mode, and it totally changed how I took pictures with this phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-telephoto"><span>Telephoto</span></h3><p>I would normally start with the primary camera sensor in a smartphone camera review, but the telephoto is the real highlight of the experience. A new 3.7x lens means the primary sensor is used from 1-3.6x zoom, and then the telephoto takes over beyond that.</p><p>The best quality from the lens is between 3.7x and 10x, and it can be used for everything from portrait shots (which I'll go into detail about later) to macro photos and everything in between. At 3.7x, it's not a replacement for the primary camera sensor simply because that's too zoomed in to get the job done, but when you can use the telephoto camera, I recommend defaulting to it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="xHLtpQwCS99WgcuYfpWLu5" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-02" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHLtpQwCS99WgcuYfpWLu5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="M4JLNFxQFntXdfMAmV2Mr5" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-03" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M4JLNFxQFntXdfMAmV2Mr5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="8Zk8gzqa2KsTDBbqH55G86" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-01" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Zk8gzqa2KsTDBbqH55G86.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="PekApNDBCPF5iVE4gLQYh6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-10x-01" alt="Comparing 10x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro, OnePlus 15, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PekApNDBCPF5iVE4gLQYh6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="bw2DseKG3gh5MmxyAe7Nh6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-10x-02" alt="Comparing 10x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bw2DseKG3gh5MmxyAe7Nh6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The quality from the sensor is simply exquisite, with accurate color reproduction, excellent natural bokeh from the large sensor, and generally good dynamic range.

These cameras already capture plenty of detail, so the images don't need to be further sharpened, and the result can sometimes look "very digital" if you zoom in too far.</p><p>And while I've still gotten plenty of excellent shots without that problem, I'd actually encourage Magic 8 Pro users to nix the portrait mode altogether and just shoot with the 3.7x telephoto lens in normal mode.</p><p>While portrait mode will certainly improve the separation of the foreground from the background in an image, it can sometimes be too aggressive on any phone. The 3.7x telephoto sensor, on the other hand, produces incredible natural bokeh that looks like it was shot with a much larger dedicated camera more often than not. These examples prove it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

difference between using regular and portrait modes with this camera. Because portrait mode doesn't always get it right and Honor's software doesn't allow you to tweak the portrait blur in post, sticking with using the 3.7x tele on normal mode is going to produce the best shots from the phone, and honestly, the best shots from any smartphone camera I've used to date.</p><p>Some of this is down to pure sensor size, but the crispness and natural look also come from being able to capture longer exposure shots than most other phones. That CIPA 5.5 rating on the telephoto camera means the optical image stabilization is so good that the phone can shoot 5.5 stops slower than without OIS.</p><p>In plain terms, your camera shutter can stay open longer without producing a blurry image, which means it can use a lower ISO, creating noise-free shots with tons of natural detail. It also means you can freehand video from this sensor, and it'll come out looking more stable than other phones.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-main-and-ultrawide"><span>Main and ultrawide</span></h3><p>The main and ultrawide cameras on the Magic 8 Pro remain the same as the ones from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>As Honor has evolved over the years from a value brand to a premium one, its phone designs and specs have followed suit. We've seen the brand push out foldables that rival Samsung's best, the strongest ingress protection next to OnePlus, cameras that would make an iPhone blush, and OLED displays that eclipse the best from every brand.</p><p>That pedigree continues with a new level of excellence on the Honor Magic 8 Pro, a new flagship that launches globally on January 8, 2026, and brings along an OLED panel with a bevy of accessibility features, custom user-level calibration, the best eye care solutions we've yet seen, and a brightness level that'll blow you away.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15's display</a> impressed us with its ultrafast refresh rate, Honor is focusing more on brightness and accessibility solutions for the Magic 8 Pro's display, and it comes out on top for most people because of it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-comfort-and-brightness"><span>Comfort and brightness</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WL6ssm1tdTI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>When I first learned I was sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> in spring 2023, phones from brands like Honor, OnePlus, and Motorola were the first to offer alternatives that worked. Since then, Honor has doubled down on the eye-friendly nature of its displays, adopting better dimming methods as the default, faster PWM dimming than most other manufacturers, tons of bespoke eyecare solutions, and more.</p><p>Because of this focus, the Magic 8 Pro is the new gold standard for overall flagship display quality <em>and</em> comfort. It's funny to have a new winner so closely after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15</a>, but this is how the smartphone industry works sometimes.</p><p>That all starts with a combination of class-leading peak brightness and a bevy of eyecare solutions that genuinely help people who need them. Out of the box, the Magic 8 Pro uses a comfortable single-pulse DC dimming method from 21-100% brightness. A user-selectable option for Honor's alternative "comfort" triple-pulse method is found under the Honor Eye Care Display section in settings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwxpC4Ctfm95wLcSE4rpLm" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-dimming" alt="An infographic of the Honor Magic 8 Pro's dimming options, including measured graphs of the brightness and dimming waves plus an image of each brightness level taken at 1/6400 shutter speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwxpC4Ctfm95wLcSE4rpLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the names, I find the "classic" mode to be far more comfortable than the "comfort" dimming option. Modulation is impressively low overall, and high-frequency PWM dimming at 20% brightness and below ensures substantial comfort even for sensitive users.</p><p>On top of being comfortable, this panel is the brightest I've measured on any smartphone to date by around 10%. Not only that, but I've found that the HDR contrast on this display looks noticeably better than phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> when viewed under sunlight.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dZu3n5ZjxTyP89JFRZHdp4" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-reflectivity-01" alt="Viewing an HDR picture of capybaras on the Google Photos app in the sunlight on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Honor Magic 8 Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZu3n5ZjxTyP89JFRZHdp4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aY2tgEcET5pNAS7njNKTs4" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-reflectivity-02" alt="Viewing an HDR picture of capybaras on the Google Photos app in the sunlight on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Honor Magic 8 Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aY2tgEcET5pNAS7njNKTs4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Magic 8 Pro doesn't feature the same anti-glare layer that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> does. That means reflections in sunlight will lower the contrast ratio of the overall image, but Honor's display does an excellent job of making up for that.</p><p>At around 3,600 nits of actual, measured HDR brightness, this display pumps out the nits needed to be visible outside and still provides a contrast ratio that looks OLED good. To put that in perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> hits 2,600 nits of peak brightness, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL tops out around 3,300 nits.</p><p>To make those numbers even more impressive, Honor doesn't use nasty PWM dimming at high brightness, so your display isn't strobing your brain with these high brightness values, unlike Samsung and Google.

A new, scalable Extra Dim option, found under accessibility settings, can further reduce brightness without greatly affecting modulation.</p><p>The Magic 8 Pro's display also supports the company's unique accessibility settings like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Defocus Eyecare</a>, plus additional accessibility options for hardware-level blue light blocking, a circadian rhythm mode that adjusts the display temperature throughout the day, ambient light temperature adjustment, a motion sickness mode, and a circularly polarized light filter built in for comfort.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yWgArjnH84YR2WsrFCP4YC" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-03" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro with a colorful wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWgArjnH84YR2WsrFCP4YC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This one's a true 10-bit display that doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">color dithering</a> in the default vibrant color mode. Temporal dithering is yet another ridiculous way manufacturers have found to simulate better image quality at the expense of sensitive users.</p><p>Honor isn't pushing any boundaries with the 120Hz refresh rate, but it's an LTPO panel, which means it can drop as low as 1Hz when needed. That's great for people who love to use the always-on display, especially since Honor provides a <em>true</em> always-on display that won't turn off if you don't want it to.</p><p>Additionally, I've found that the Magic 8 Pro's display resolution does a great job of selecting high resolution (2808 x 1256) when necessary. That makes games look nice and crisp, something that's important if you like distance sniping in games like Fortnite.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-launch-of-a-brand-new-tool"><span>The launch of a brand new tool</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e6BQbtSUqtxHmKxJVgEWoF" name="honor-magic-8-pro-flicker-detection-tool" alt="The new flicker detection tool on the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e6BQbtSUqtxHmKxJVgEWoF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's new flicker-detection tool built into the phone speaks directly to me and anyone else concerned about flickering lights in their life.

You'll get a quick good/moderate/bad result with enough data to help you make positive changes, if need be.</p><p>The inclusion of this tool is a testament to how seriously Honor is taking the serious problem of flickering lights, and it means that all users of this phone can swap out the nasty flickering lights that cause some people debilitating pain. This tool <em>only</em> works on lights right now, though, and doesn't seem to work on displays, so there's room for future improvement, too.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-verdict"><span>Verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Tx3wQvBdasuyRTJL2KtDoC" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-01" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro with a space wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tx3wQvBdasuyRTJL2KtDoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is the flagship phone that feels like it finally doesn't compromise on anything, including a class-leading display. From impressively accurate color reproduction and brightness, to accessibility options that ensure even sensitive users don't get left behind, this is a phone that aims to be the best for everyone who wants one.</p><p>It's even more impressive that Honor launched the industry's first built-in flicker detection tool with this phone, completing the circle of catering to individuals who are sensitive to the overly bright, flickering displays and LED lights that are increasingly more common in our lives. It's a huge deal that a company like Honor is recognizing these problems and developing solutions to them, and it makes recommending the Honor Magic 8 Pro incredibly easy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Honor wants to change that with the UK launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on">Magic 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>The highlight is a new 200MP AI SuperNight telephoto camera. Honor combines a 1/1.4-inch sensor, f/2.6 aperture, OIS, and 3.7x optical zoom, so you get more light, clearer details, and sharper zoom shots even in tough conditions.</p><p>There’s also a 50MP main camera with OIS and a 50MP ultra-wide lens with macro support.</p><p>Honor’s upgraded AiMAGE Camera System is the technical highlight. The company says its AI adaptive stabilization makes it seven times easier to get stable zoom shots without a tripod, with a CIPA 5.5 stability rating. In simple terms, handheld night zoom shots should finally look good instead of blurry.</p><p>Color science is another area where the company is pushing hard. The new Magic Colour engine uses deep learning to process 16.77 million colors, applying device-to-cloud color migration so what you see in preview actually matches the final shot.</p><p>After you take a photo, Honor's AI Photos Agent steps in. It offers one-tap tools like AI Eraser, AI Outpainting, AI Cutout, and AI Colour to make editing faster and easier.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LSjC4Bn2a89ncXKEVDBXxS" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in gold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSjC4Bn2a89ncXKEVDBXxS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Kg9krdFGFJLBZVCtv2PuwS" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in cyan" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kg9krdFGFJLBZVCtv2PuwS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FNnG5c6XuYj2EH22UhWf7S" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNnG5c6XuYj2EH22UhWf7S.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="dedicated-ai-button-for-the-camera-2">Dedicated AI button for the camera</h2><p>There’s a dedicated AI Button, separate from the power key, that opens the camera instantly with a double press, even if the screen is locked.

This setup enables things like contextual screen understanding, live translation, and advanced Gemini tools such as Veo 3 and Connected Apps. MagicOS 10 also manages smarter system controls, AI deepfake and voice-clone detection, and quick-access tools through the Magic Sidebar.</p><p>For performance, the phone uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and includes advanced gaming technology. Honor's GPU-NPU AI upscaling can boost some games to 120fps at 1080p, even if they start at lower settings. With a 6,270mAh silicon-carbon battery, 100W wired charging, and 80W wireless charging, battery life should not be an issue.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KzA8T9cUVt4iYvtxNzsD9F" name="Honor-Magic-8-Lite" alt="Honor Magic 8 Lite back panel in reddish brown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzA8T9cUVt4iYvtxNzsD9F.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="B64ExLNXrn2t4UFMdfqaeE" name="Honor-Magic-8-Lite" alt="Honor Magic 8 Lite back panel in green" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B64ExLNXrn2t4UFMdfqaeE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ipTSbjqKAeaRfdJi8WcsbE" name="Honor-Magic-8-Lite" alt="Honor Magic 8 Lite back panel in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipTSbjqKAeaRfdJi8WcsbE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The phone sports a 6.71-inch LTPO OLED display with a 1 to 120Hz refresh rate and eye-care features like 4320Hz PWM dimming.

This allowed users to send and receive files between an iPhone and a Pixel 10 device using Android 16's native Quick Share feature without any workarounds. After keeping the feature exclusive to the Pixel 10 series for over a month, Google now seems to be expanding support to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><h2 id="pixel-9-looks-next-in-line-for-airdrop-support-2">Pixel 9 looks next in line for AirDrop support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.77%;"><img id="iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY" name="google-apple-quick-share-airdrop-update" alt="Google's Pixel 10 series can now use Quick Share to send files to users with an iPhone's AirDrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="860" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google released a new Android Canary build on January 8, 2026.

That does not necessarily mean those devices will never receive AirDrop and Quick Share interoperability, but it suggests Google is not ready to enable the feature on them just yet. Google has previously stated that support for older Pixel phones will arrive at a later date.</p><p>For now, the feature does not actually work on the Pixel 9 series despite the files being present, indicating Google still needs to enable the functionality on its end. It is possible the company is targeting a future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-starts-rolling-out-android-16-qpr3-beta-1-1-is-rolling-out-with-an-important-fix">Android 16 QPR3</a> update, or it could delay the feature until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a>.

I saw all variations of AI, AR, and XR glasses, and while some clearly have a lot of potential (as you'll see later in this post), most of the products weren't quite up to scratch.</p><p>Thankfully, I got to see plenty of great products, including phones, audio gear, accessories, and a smattering of AI-assisted tech. So let's take a look at what stood out at CES 2026.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-phone-flagship-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold"><span>Best Android phone (flagship): Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was only ever going to be one winner this year. Samsung showcased the Galaxy Z TriFold at the event ahead of its launch in the U.S., and the unique foldable is praise-worthy in its own right. It is being sold in limited quantities, and the retail pricing is incredulously high, but as a showcase of what's possible with mobile tech, there really is no phone better.</p><p>This is my second time testing the TriFold — I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">used it at a Dubai mall</a> last month — and it felt much better this time around. The phone is just as polished as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and it doesn't feel like a tech demo at all. The added real estate is great when it comes to consuming entertainment, and although the panel has higher glare than the Z Fold 7, it is just great to be able to take a regular-sized phone and turn it into a 10-inch tablet.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-phone-budget-tcl-nxtpaper-70-pro"><span>Best Android phone (budget): TCL NXTPAPER 70 Pro</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZG5tzUpaX8EVkKpvcLB5SV" name="TCL NXTPAPER 70 Pro" alt="TCL NXTPAPER 70 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZG5tzUpaX8EVkKpvcLB5SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TCL's NXTPAPER tech is just fabulous, and the brand showcased the 70 Pro in Las Vegas. It retains the same panel that's designed to be easier on the eyes, and I like how it feels to use. The phone itself is a decent budget choice, but the unique panel makes it stand out.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-concept-tdm-neo"><span>Best concept: TDM Neo</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SDtuJvZMpHgZNNAxgMhoun" name="TDM Neo" alt="TDM Neo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDtuJvZMpHgZNNAxgMhoun.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TDM is a new manufacturer that has a highly interesting idea: a headset that twists into a speaker. It's dubbed the Neo, and at an initial glance, it's just a headset like any other — it weighs about the same as well. But you can twist both ear cups inwards, and it turns into a Bluetooth speaker.</p><p>I haven't seen anything like it, and the Neo does a good job both as a headset and speaker. It isn't quite in production yet, but it is one of those ideas that I'd like to see in a consumer device.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wearable-xgimi-memo-one"><span>Best wearable: XGIMI Memo One</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MEEos2XTzs6ku3xyTzsj5R" name="XGIMI Memo One" alt="XGIMI Memo One" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEEos2XTzs6ku3xyTzsj5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no doubt that XGIMI makes the best projectors. At CES, the brand introduced MemoMind, a new series of stylish smart glasses. There are several variants available, but the one I like is Memo One, which has a built-in display and a high amount of customization, and did I say it was stylish?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-accessory-anker-nano-charger-45w"><span>Best accessory: Anker Nano Charger 45W</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o43CMas8WzG6xfNVX8TzjW" name="Anker Nano Charger 45W" alt="Anker Nano Charger 45W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o43CMas8WzG6xfNVX8TzjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nano looks like a regular charger, but it has a unique 180-degree foldable design, and it ensures that the charger is facing up no matter what orientation you use it in. It's a small tweak, but one that makes using the product so much better. I'm predicting we'll see most other charging brands will introduce something similar soon.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-ai-innovation-nvidia-remix-logic"><span>Best AI innovation: NVIDIA Remix Logic</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FfDpJ5wuxNXu2B5SMQJEk9" name="NVIDIA Remix Logic" alt="NVIDIA Remix Logic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfDpJ5wuxNXu2B5SMQJEk9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NVIDIA)</span></figcaption></figure><p>NVIDIA's Remix tech gives old games a visual overhaul, and the brand showcased a demo of its newest feature, Remix Logic. The new mode interacts with game scenarios to greater extent, and it gives game modders even greater flexibility and control in customizing in-game environments. Remix Logic is the best utilization of AI I've seen at CES this year, and as someone who enjoys old games, I'm just excited NVIDIA is building out this tech.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-vr-xr-device-even-realities-g2"><span>Best VR/XR device: Even Realities G2</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eRbiGAMJr6D5sywZMbHurf" name="Even Realities G2" alt="Even Realities G2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eRbiGAMJr6D5sywZMbHurf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even Realities isn't chasing the latest trends in smart glasses — it's setting out on its own path, and that's what I like about the G2 the most. The glasses don't look like a tech product, but you still get waveguided lenses that project notifications and relevant data from your phone. It's a great product, and I was constantly asked about the glasses as I was walking around the show floor.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It comes with a flat 6.8-inch 120Hz FHD+ screen with high brightness up to 1,000 nits and Display Color Boost, which affords clear visibility in direct sunlight.</p><p>Finished in vegan leather-inspired Pantone Pure Cashmere or Pantone Evening Blue, the screen is made from Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, and the phone meets MIL-STD-810H standards for durability against everything from drops to extreme temperatures and humidity. It also boasts an IP68 and IP69 rating for dust and water resistance. On the back is the dual-camera array in a square housing, which is similar to the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>'s design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4" name="moto-g-power-2026-evening-blue-hero" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in an evening blue color beside a coffee." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Equipped with a 5,200 mAh battery, you get an impressive up to two days of battery life per charge, and the battery retains 80 percent health even after 1,000 charging cycles. A feature called Battery Care also manages background apps and tracks usage to help further optimize performance. The phone supports 30W TurboPower charging, so you can get hours more of use after just a few minutes of charge.</p><p>Along with stereo speakers and support for Hi-Res Audio and Dolby Atmos, the Moto G Power 2026 has two microphones, a side fingerprint reader, face unlock, water touch, and a 3.5mm headset jack, which is a rarity nowadays with phones.</p><p>While it only has 128GB of storage, you can expand this up to 1TB via an optional microSD card, another rarity nowadays with phones. Motorola hasn't confirmed the official length of support with us, but if the Moto G Power 2026 follows suit with the company's latest Moto G phones, you may only get a few years of software and security updates, likely up to Android 18 with security patches through 2029.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bymxWtn8jvRCwAj7W4TNQW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bymxWtn8jvRCwAj7W4TNQW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the CMF Phone 2 Pro has a slightly smaller 6.77-inch FHD+ flexible AMOLED display with peak brightness of 3,000 nits, 1,300 nits outdoors, and 800 nits typical. The screen offers a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and is covered in Panda Glass.</p><p>There are four finish options, black, orange, light green, and white, each with visible stainless-steel screws and an aluminum camera that affords both durability and a refined, unique look. Harish Jonnalagadda says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMP Phone 2 Pro review</a> that this phone stays true to Nothing's reputation for making phones that stand out for their designs.</p><p>"The bold colours and vibrant accents give the phone a good presence," he explains, singling out the orange finish option as the one to get. The green and black options mimic a frosted glass finish, the white a sandstone-like matte texture, and the orange a distinctive metallic sheen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the phone only meets an IP54 dust- and water-resistance rating, Nothing says it has passed various impact tests with iron balls and intense bending tests for durability. It's also the thinnest Nothing phone to date and 12 grams lighter than the first-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>. This is complemented by smooth curves and good weight distribution. This phone doesn't have a detachable back this time, though. It does work with tons of attachable accessories, like a kickstand, case, fisheye lens, and more.</p><p>The battery is 5,000mAh with support for slightly faster 33W fast charging as well as 5W reverse wired charging. It comes with 128GB or 256GB storage and, like the Moto G Power 2026, you can expand this via an optional microSD card, but the CMF Phone 2 Pro supports ones up to 2TB.</p><p>Equipped with a fingerprint sensor, the CMF Phone 2 Pro has just a single bottom-firing mono speaker, which is one of its biggest downsides. Loaded with Android 16, you do get three years of Android updates and six years of security, however. The one major factor worth noting, however, is that it's only available in the U.S. through Nothing's beta program with limited carrier and network support versus an official launch. This means possible issues with 5G and LTE connectivity and no after-sales service.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-cmf-phone-2-pro-the-specs-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. CMF Phone 2 Pro: The specs</h2><p>Let's check out the key specs of both these phones at-a-glance.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Moto G Power 2026</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>CMF Phone Pro 2</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Hello UX)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Pure Cashmere, Pantone Evening Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Orange, White, Light Green</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.77 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,388 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,392 x 1,084</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+ flexible AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>Adaptive 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6300</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB (expandable up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main with Quad Pixel technology, 8MP ultra-wide, macro vision lens, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP telephoto, 8MP ultra-wide, 16MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Hi-Res Audio, Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Mono Speaker</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP54</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>166.62 x 77.10 x 8.72mm</p></td><td  ><p>164 x 78 x 7.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>208 grams</p></td><td  ><p>185 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-cmf-phone-2-pro-productivity-ai-and-performance-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. CMF Phone 2 Pro: Productivity, AI, and performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 runs on Android 16, as noted, with features like Moto Secure, Moto Unplugged, Family Space, ThinkShield, and Hello UX.

You aren't going to get a camera experience that blows you away with either of these phones. But you'll be able to take decent photos for posterity and social sharing. The Moto G Power 2026 has a 50MP main camera with Quad Pixel technology and optical image stabilization. There's also RAW Night Vision mode, a surprising inclusion in such an entry phone. This is complemented by the 8MP ultrawide camera, macro vision lens, and 32MP front "selfie" camera.</p><p>There are many AI-powered camera features, like Auto Night Vision, Portrait Mode, Auto Smile Capture, and Shot Optimization. You can also access all the favorite Google Photos editing tools through that app. We haven't yet reviewed this phone or camera, but the Moto G Power 2025 has a similar camera array. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">his review of that last-gen phone</a>, Derrek Lee called the cameras simply "usable," noting you can get good photos in favorable lighting, but that they are often noisy and lack detail. We don't yet know if the Moto G Power 2026 offers any improvements in this department, but you can likely expect a similar experience for this budget phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.49%;"><img id="LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2884" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro also has a 50MP main camera along with a 50MP telephoto lens, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 16MP front camera. Capture 4K videos as well and enjoy an improved experience thanks to the TrueLens Engine 3. With features like portrait effects, you can also enjoy 20x digital zoom.</p><p>Jonnalagadda says the cameras are basic, and you can capture usable video as well. It has decent shooting modes and takes passable portraits, but it's nothing to write home about. Daylight shots are good with nice detail and vibrancy, he says, and even low-light images come out okay. It's worth playing around with the optional wide-angle and fisheye lens attachments, which allow you to get some fun shots. While they don't rival the cameras in more premium phones, Jonnalagadda calls the cameras in the CMF Phone 2 Pro the "best you'll find on a sub-$300 phone."</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-cmf-phone-2-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. CMF Phone 2 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Tt2FRwTYCyGfMTTBPfht3W" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tt2FRwTYCyGfMTTBPfht3W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The decision between the Moto G Power 2026 vs. the CMF Phone 2 Pro is a tough one. If you're looking for something you can hang onto for a long time, the CMF Phone 2 Pro presumably offers longer support with security updates; though software could be a wash since it comes loaded with a generation older version of Android. If this doesn't matter and you just want a basic phone to use for a few years, you'll find valuable features with both.</p><p>The Moto G Power is much more durable, making it a good choice for a teen, tween, or senior who might be more accident-prone. It's also good if you want a phone you can take virtually anywhere, from the pool to the ski hill. But it isn't as powerful, and you get very limited storage unless you invest in a microSD card separately. The camera performance, if anything like its predecessor, may leave much to be desired.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro has unique features like Essential Space, though it's up to you if you think you'd even use it. It does have a brighter screen and cameras are fairly similar, the CMF Phone 2 Pro adding a telephoto lens while the Moto G Power 2026 has a better front camera and speakers, which might make it more suitable for content creators.</p><p>Overall, Jonnalagadda calls the CMF Phone 2 Pro the best budget phone of 2025, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">the best Android phone under $300</a>. So, for more people, it's the one to get. But the beta program availability in the U.S. limits your options, and this might deter you from investing in this phone versus the Moto G Power 2026, which offers more widespread support.</p><p>It comes down to your usage habits. For something rugged and built to last with a good selfie camera and speakers, fast charging, and basic AI and photo features, the Moto G Power 2026 is an alright option. If you want a fun, personalized experience to organize your life with a lot of storage (via optional microSD card), a good telephoto lens, and a slightly better processor, CMF Phone 2 Pro is for you. Overall, most people will find more value with the CMF Phone 2 Pro.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's an option</strong></em></p><p>If you value durability, audio, larger screen size, the front camera, and battery life above all else, the Moto G Power 2026 is a worthy contender.

Using this data and an AI algorithm, Shokz can counterbalance outside noise using the speakers, and lets users "fine-tune the noise reduction level manually" depending on the context.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="My7GPtgBnGCNU5vkXzvnkZ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-Pro-noise-reduction-render" alt="Press render of a Shokz OpenFit Pro earbud with noise waves entering and exiting the earbud, representing the "Noise Reduction" feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/My7GPtgBnGCNU5vkXzvnkZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shokz)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Shokz OpenFit Pro will never match traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025">wireless earbuds with ANC</a> with a proper noise seal, they're much better for indoor contexts than the OpenFit 2 series — which force you to hear <em>everything</em> around you — while still giving you <strong>much</strong> better situational awareness outdoors than typical in-ear earbuds.</p><p>It's a feature that Shokz's bone conduction earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">OpenRun Pro 2</a> <em>can't</em> offer, since they don't sit above the ear canal.</p><p>Of course, by cramming in larger speakers, new mics, and a "higher density, steel-cased battery to power the noise reduction system," Shokz had to make the OpenFit Pro (12.3g per earbud) significantly bulkier than the OpenFit 2 (9.4g) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">OpenFit Air</a> (8.7g). They use the same nickel-titanium ear hooks to keep them comfortably secure, but you'll undoubtedly feel the difference.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, Shokz includes "stabilizer" accessories in the box; they're O-shaped rings you attach to the hook so they're less likely to bounce or fall off while moving. I'm curious how necessary these will be for workouts like running, as I've never had an issue with stability while wearing the OpenFit 2s.</p><p>Plus, the noise-reducing "Privacy Mode" cuts the Pro's 12-hour battery life down to just six hours, so it won't last for a full workday.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pbYyNekqSXrPGXzPTJeRWY" name="Shokz-OpenFit-Pro-press-photo-2" alt="Press photo of the Shokz OpenFit Pro earbuds and charging case sitting on a black surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pbYyNekqSXrPGXzPTJeRWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5022" height="2825" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shokz)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Generally speaking, the OpenFit Pro earbuds have similar features and perks to older models, only slightly changed. For example, they have seamless button controls for music and call shortcuts — only now you can long-press to turn noise reduction mode on or off.</p><p>Likewise, most OpenFits support multipoint pairing, so you can sync to your phone and laptop at once. But the Pro series upgrades from Bluetooth 5.4 to 6.1, giving it better power efficiency and improved audio streaming quality.</p><p>And while past OpenFits promised "quick charging," the Pros add four hours of playback after ten minutes, while the 2 series only adds two hours. It still uses the same style of charging case with magnetized pins, though Shokz says the Pros have a "more stable charging contact" than past models.</p><p>I'm also happy to see Shokz add Wear Detection to the Pro series, so audio automatically stops when you remove the earbuds; its absence was one of my few complaints with the OpenFit 2 series.</p><p>Shokz has offered me an OpenFit Pro review unit, so I'm looking forward to putting the Pros through their paces and see how they compare to the OpenFit 2 and 2 Plus. For now, I suspect that the Pro will be best suited for athletes who want to wear these all day; those buying them primarily for workouts won't benefit as much from noise reduction or Dolby Atmos, and may prefer a lighter, cheaper OpenFit option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="11079cb0-68ac-43a1-a558-f1cbf8c76178">            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/shokz-openfit-pro-open-ear-true-wireless-active-noise-reduction-earbuds-white/6665562" data-model-name="OpenFit Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSNbTyusjRqxVSFy4bLfNZ.png' alt="Render of the white Shokz OpenFit Pro workout earbuds"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Shokz</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">OpenFit Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Shokz OpenFit Pros feature 11 × 20 mm drivers with Dolby Atmos support, 12 hours of battery per charge or 50 hours with the case, IP55 water resistance, multipoint pairing, and easy button shortcuts.

With these updates, the company is making it easier to write emails, search through your inbox, and view messages in a new format we have not seen before.</p><p>Google has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">integrated Gemini into Gmail</a> for some time, but until now, it has been limited to paid Gemini users. With the upcoming changes, Google is expanding select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini-powered features</a>, including personalized Suggested Replies and Help Me Write, to all Gmail users at no additional cost.</p><h2 id="ai-overviews-come-to-gmail-2">AI Overviews come to Gmail</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W3bBpde33assuws6YcJDKe" name="Gmail AI Overviews (search) Image" alt="AI Overviews in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W3bBpde33assuws6YcJDKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest update, however, is the arrival of AI Overviews in Gmail. Similar to how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-overviews-led-users-astray-some-phone-numbers-are-scams-report">AI Overviews work in Google Search</a>, Gemini will now scan relevant emails and generate concise summaries in response to natural language questions. Google says this will allow users to quickly surface key information without manually digging through messages.</p><p>In addition to search, AI Overviews will also show up in individual threads, showing you a quick summary of the conversation.</p><p>For example, instead of searching for keywords, you can ask questions like "What size shoes did I order recently from Amazon?" and Gemini will generate an AI Overview with the answer. The ability to ask questions and view AI Overviews in Gmail is rolling out today, but only for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.</p><h2 id="the-new-ai-inbox-wants-to-tell-you-what-matters-2">The new AI Inbox wants to tell you what matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV" name="Gmail AI Inbox Demo" alt="Gmail's new AI Inbox feature in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps even bigger news is the introduction of a new "AI Inbox" alongside the existing inbox view. Rather than listing emails chronologically, AI Inbox will offer a personalized briefing that highlights to-dos and surfaces what matters most.</p><p>If you have a pending bill or an upcoming dentist appointment, for instance, it will be flagged automatically and shown as a priority in the AI Inbox. Emails from important contacts and people you interact with most frequently will also be prioritized in this new view.</p><p>Google says all analysis used to power AI Inbox is handled securely and follows its standard privacy protections. The AI Inbox feature is currently limited to trusted testers, with Google saying it is planning to make it more broadly available "in the coming months."</p> ]]></dc:content>

The idea of managing everything in one place often falls apart when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-security-cameras-store-locally-not-cloud">security cameras</a> get involved. Samsung knows this is a problem and is working more closely with Arlo to solve it.</p><p>Samsung SmartThings has entered into a new agreement with Arlo to bring Arlo’s smart security platform into the SmartThings system. The two companies have worked together before, but this time the partnership goes beyond basic compatibility. Now, the goal is to keep everything within the Samsung app.</p><p>With this partnership, Samsung isn't just letting you view an Arlo feed on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. They are leveraging Arlo’s Smart Security SaaS Platform to power entirely new security service offerings within the SmartThings app.</p><h2 id="security-stays-in-one-place-2">Security stays in one place</h2><p>The goal is to let Samsung users access robust security tools without leaving the SmartThings interface. Do note that this expanded rollout has an initial focus on the U.S. market, so international users may have to wait a bit longer to see these specific features land on their devices.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Samsung and Arlo have worked together. Last year, SmartThings started using Arlo’s AI-powered object detection, which gave users custom notifications for things like package delivery, people, and pets.</p><p>This new announcement continues that progress. For most Galaxy users, the integration should make things easier. Rather than managing each security camera separately, SmartThings wants to be the main hub where you can control everything and respond to alerts more quickly.</p><p>This move is also a good opportunity for Arlo. The company values privacy and data protection, so reaching Samsung’s large user base is a big advantage. These new features could be available in the SmartThings app soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Spotify announced an update that's rolling out for devices that brings more interactions via DMs.</p><p>Earlier today (Jan 7), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-07/listening-activity-request-to-jam-messages-updates/">Spotify announced</a> that it's bringing two key feature updates to its Messages that might facilitate better user-to-user interactions. The first feature involves those coveted Jam sessions, as users can soon "Request to Jam" in Messages. The platform states users will find a convenient way to invite friends or family into a live listening session.</p><p>This update in Messages is for Premium users. Spotify's update will place a Jam icon at the top right of your DM thread with someone. Upon tapping, it will open a "Listening Activity" sub-menu, to which you'll tap Jam again and "ask to join" if they're listening to tracks already. Spotify states that the recipient in this scenario will become the session "host," but both parties can easily add songs to keep the party moving.</p><p>The rest of the session operates pretty similarly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/spotify-jam-arrives-on-android-auto-via-an-update">to how Jam already works</a> on Spotify currently.</p><p>The second update, if you spotted it, involves bringing Listening Activity to Messages.</p><p>After activating Listening Activity within your Privacy and Social settings (check your side menu), users can then select who's able to view it. This lets you keep some people in the loop, while leaving others out and guessing. If someone has enabled their activity, you'll see their name and what they're listening to down in the Messages area.</p><h2 id="i-like-to-party-2">I like to party</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="8wcuSDLSGprzcyC7u7uyqN" name="spotify-jam-session-request-messages" alt="Spotify's Jam session requests arrives for Messages, as users can "ask to join" for a party session." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wcuSDLSGprzcyC7u7uyqN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="XMsyLYA6Vs9ZCWgut4vjqN" name="spotify-listening-activity-messages" alt="Spotify adds Listening Activity to Messages, giving friends and family an eagle eye into what the other loves and enjoys." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMsyLYA6Vs9ZCWgut4vjqN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Moreover, Spotify states you can quickly engage with their activity and add songs they've streamed to your personal playlist. Regions with Spotify Messages should begin seeing these two features appear soon on Android and iOS. However, a "broader" rollout is expected in February.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-gets-dms-messages-for-music-lovers-sharing-tracks-and-podcasts">Spotify Messages</a> arrived as a late summer update in 2025. A patch that focused on music-lovers and helping those people connect with other like-minded individuals. Messages was stated as a one-on-one chatting service that lets users share music, podcasts, and audiobooks featured on Spotify in one convenient place. Fortunately, you won't receive texts on Spotify from just anyone.</p><p>The update states that users must accept a Message request before they can begin texting. This should, hopefully, assist users in weeding out any potential nefarious users ahead of time. Spotify's Jam also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/spotify-jam-arrives-on-android-auto-via-an-update">made its rounds to Android Auto</a>, making those long car rides not so long, and definitely way more enjoyable.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states that the Pixel launcher "did not fully load."</p><p>The device's screen was stuck, only displaying its wallpaper for a considerable amount of time without producing a major necessity: its UI.

The report adds that the Pro model struggled after rebooting. To be specific, the device's screen "remained black" for what seemed like a prolonged period of time. It's unclear just how widespread these issues are, and if they're directly tied to the latest Google Play systems update (which they could be, considering the timing).</p><p>The publication notes that once the rebooting sequences are completed, the Pixel devices don't appear to struggle.

The tipster claims that OnePlus could seek to empower this device with a battery over 7,000mAh. This is where things get speculative (as if they weren't already), with the post claiming that consumers could see a capacity of around 7,500mAh.</p><p>DCS states that this higher total is the "maximum," which could indicate that OnePlus could pack a battery with a capacity of anywhere between 7,000mAh and 7,500mAh.</p><p>The phone's camera system will reportedly feature a 50MP telephoto lens. While DCS didn't expand on the main sensor, the publication revisited older rumors, which claimed the 15T might only feature a dual-array. The tipster then responded to comments, alleging the phone's launch window. One user asked, "When will it be released," to which DCS responded, "Around April."</p><p>Phone features weren't alleged in this leak, though we have a few specifications to play around with, following an older post.</p><h2 id="the-15t-is-on-the-way-2">The 15T is on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H9RQTKvQdd6k5PhgugQcUo" name="oneplus-15-charging-super-vooc-01" alt="Charging a OnePlus 15 with the included Super VOOC ultrafast charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9RQTKvQdd6k5PhgugQcUo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus 15T rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/alleged-oneplus-15t-specs-rumored-battery-chip-rumors">have been pretty scarce</a> (and scattered), as the latest major leak arrived last June. Digital Chat Station alleged at the time that the OnePlus 15T was inbound with one feature that would beat out the flagship: its battery. Those early rumors only claimed that the capacity would reach heights over the OnePlus 15; however, it's not until now that we've seen what it could be.</p><p>Other rumors claim that the phone could receive a flagship Snapdragon SoC, as well as a smaller 6.3-inch 1.5K display and a 3D ultrasonic fingerprint reader.</p><p>There's one thing to note: if the OnePlus 15T is to beat the 15 in battery, it might have to sit somewhere between 7,400mAh and the alleged 7,500mAh max. When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">OnePlus 15 launched</a> in October, it debuted with a huge 7,300mAh battery with 120W wired charging. We'll have to see if OnePlus hits this rumored April release window.

But if you're looking to stretch out its lifespan — both for short-term gains and long-term battery health — there are a few simple settings to familiarize yourself with!</p><p>One key reason I gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> a glowing review is its improved battery life, paired with faster charging. The 45mm model easily lasts two days in ideal conditions and performed very well in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">battery test</a>, handling GPS workouts or LTE streaming with ease.</p><p>Because of this, I tend to use Watch 4 settings that drain its battery <em>faster</em> for a better user experience. But for those of you who'd prefer the opposite, and want to maximize your Pixel Watch 4 battery life — particularly as its capacity fades with time — these are the simple tricks and downgrades to make the Watch 4 last longer per charge.</p><h2 id="turn-on-battery-saver-mode-2">Turn on Battery Saver mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mYA4Po7VW9FEStYqHMm3oB" name="Pixel-Watch-4-Battery-Saver-mode" alt="A photo of the Pixel Watch 4 on a wrist showing "Turn on Battery Saver mode?" prompt, with info on what settings will change with this mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mYA4Po7VW9FEStYqHMm3oB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll start with the obvious setting that you probably know about already. Swipe down from the main watch face view to see a battery icon with a percentage. Tap it, say <strong>Don't show this again</strong>, then tap the check mark. Now, tapping the battery button triggers Battery Saver mode immediately.</p><p>You now have an instant way to put the Watch 4 in a more efficient state, with limited background activity, delayed notifications, and disabled always-on display (AOD). If toggled on at 100%, Battery Saver makes the Watch 4 41mm and 45mm last up to 40 or 72 hours, respectively.</p><p>This mode triggers automatically at 15%; you can't change the threshold, so you'll have to remember to check for yourself if you want to trigger Battery Saver earlier in the day.</p><h2 id="disable-aod-and-adjust-your-display-timeout-settings-2">Disable AOD and adjust your display timeout settings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1779px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="L6Xs9fFTBQUQGsxJZiNGNa" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Slim-Metal-band-official-lifestyle" alt="The Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L6Xs9fFTBQUQGsxJZiNGNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1779" height="1001" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">AOD looks great, but do you need it? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google estimates that the Pixel Watch 4 41mm and 45mm last 30 and 40 hours with AOD active, respectively; it <em>doesn't</em> say how long they're supposed to last with AOD turned off, but you'll get a few extra hours, at least, and those hours will add up to fewer charge cycles over time.</p><p>I prefer using AOD so I can glance at my wrist for info without needing tilt-to-wake, and it makes the watch look more stylish. But if you can accept losing those perks, open the watch settings, tap <strong>Display</strong>, then toggle <strong>Always-on screen off</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mzM7d3vdkPmBpx8B8nEBAZ" name="Pixel-Watch-4-screen-timeout-settings" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 on a wrist, showing the Display settings menu for screen timeout, "go to watch face" timeout, and Always-on screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mzM7d3vdkPmBpx8B8nEBAZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My typical display settings aren't the most efficient </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this same menu, you can adjust your <strong>screen timeout window</strong> from the default 15 seconds to 10 seconds, which will reduce power usage subtly over time.</p><p>There's also the <strong>Go to watch face</strong> delay setting: With a longer duration like "after 1 minute," the Watch 4 will keep your current menu or app open for a minute even if the screen dims, but this consumes extra battery. Instead, choose something shorter like "After 15 seconds," or even "Immediately," which prolongs its capacity but (annoyingly) makes you navigate back to an app if you're distracted.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>adaptive brightness</strong> is on by default, as it should be, but a final battery-saving option is to tap the <strong>Brightness</strong> setting, toggle it off, and then tap the <strong>- button</strong> to make the lowest brightness the default. You won't benefit from the Watch 4's 3,000 nits, but it'll last longer than a day.</p><h2 id="disable-sound-vibrations-and-tilt-to-wake-2">Disable sound/vibrations and tilt-to-wake</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HjGcxxi9r4fWqDwz2BQwqj" name="Gemini-Raise-To-Talk-settings" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 on a man's wrist, showing the Voice sensitivity setting set to 5/5 for the Gemini Raise to Talk feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjGcxxi9r4fWqDwz2BQwqj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Gemini Raise to Talk settings </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll emphasize again that <em>I</em> wouldn't do this, necessarily, but for maximum Watch 4 capacity, disable tilt-to-wake so that you only wake the display by tapping it or rotating the display.

Essentially, Google learns your habits so that, if you tend to charge your watch overnight, it anticipates when you typically wake up and waits to hit 100% until that time — helping preserve capacity in the long run.</p><p>As I covered in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-first-things-to-do">Pixel Watch 4 beginner's guide</a>, you should go to <strong>Settings > Watch preferences > Modes</strong> and toggle <strong>Sync across watch and phone</strong> on; then, in your connected phone's settings, go to <strong>Settings > Modes > Bedtime > Bedtime Routine</strong> and set a schedule; this should make it easy for Google to adapt the watch's charging schedule, and also auto-limit background activity at night if you leave it off the charger.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Quick-Charge-Dock" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 held in hand with the Quick Charge Dock magnetically attached to the bottom." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Useful as this is, Adaptive Charging won't kick in if, for example, you use the Watch 4 for sleep tracking and charge it during the day. In that case, Google sends a 100%-charged notification to your phone when the Watch 4 is ready, but you need to be alert for it.</p><p>Google has a "Battery Defender" tool that kicks in if you leave your Pixel Watch on the charger for 4+ days, but that's already too long to wait!</p><p>You also want to make sure you don't let the Pixel Watch 4 hit 0% too often, or <em>stay</em> dead, as letting its battery stay drained has a negative impact on long-term capacity.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN has all the momentum in the NAS category, and the brand now makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS servers</a>. If you need a new NAS, you should just consider one of the brand's products; its new budget DH2300 2-bay server starts at just $177, and if you need plenty of power, the DXP4800 Plus, DXP6800 Pro, or the DXP8800 Plus are the obvious choices based on your needs.</p><p>At CES 2026, UGREEN showcased its brand-new AI-enabled NAS series, the NASync iDX6011 and iDX6011 Pro. Both models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-ai-nas-feature-introduction?utm_source=Gabymedia&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=idxpr">now on pre-order at UGREEN's website</a> and will be available in a general sale later in Q1, and they're targeted at enthusiasts.</p><p>As is always the case with UGREEN, the brand is rolling out decent incentives if you pre-order the iDX6011 or iDX6011 Pro. The high-end iDX6011 Pro with 64GB of RAM is slated to retail for a staggering $2,599, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-ai-nas-feature-introduction?utm_source=Gabymedia&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=idxpr">get it for $1,559 during the pre-order window</a>. Similarly, the base model iDX6011 with 32GB of RAM can be bought for $999, a $700 discount from its eventual $1,699 retail price, and there's a variant of the iDX6011 with 64GB of RAM that's available for $1,119 — it will retail at $1,999.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="BDUJkRXzniFLjccCvvCSeK" name="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" alt="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDUJkRXzniFLjccCvvCSeK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4824" height="2714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's get started with what you're getting with these NAS servers. The iDX6011 Pro is the one that's interesting to me, as the 6-bay server has incredible hardware. It is powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H, and the 28W TDP platform is just so much more powerful than what you usually see in this category. There are six HDD bays alongside two M.2 slots, and each HDD bay can hold a 30TB drive, with the M.2 slots accommodating 8TB drives — that's how you get total addressable storage of 196TB.</p><p>The iDX6011 Pro also gets 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and that's more than what I have in my RTX 5090 gaming machine. You get a 128GB SSD pre-installed that houses the software, two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports, dual Thunderbolt 4 ports, PCIe Gen 4 x8 slot, a total of four USB-A ports, SD card slot, HDMI, and even OCuLink connectivity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="crFSsqLVWdWdipAGfNLpVK" name="UGREEN iDX6011" alt="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/crFSsqLVWdWdipAGfNLpVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4824" height="2714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and you also get a 3.7-inch LCD panel that shows storage use, system stats, and network status. The iDX6011 Pro has the same aluminum design as the rest of UGREEN NAS models, and it gets dual fans at the rear with a magnetic dust filter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="yf5AuEHw6DFbJrKBduqB8K" name="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" alt="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yf5AuEHw6DFbJrKBduqB8K.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1680" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The standard iDX6011 retains a lot of the same features, but it misses out on the panel, and is powered instead by the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H. The standard model is sold in 32GB and 64GB RAM configurations, and there's no way to increase memory as it's soldered. Outside of that, you get the same set of ports on both NAS models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8VNABivNV8D6TXCeUQcWiK" name="UGREEN iDX6011" alt="UGREEN iDX6011" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VNABivNV8D6TXCeUQcWiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4824" height="2713" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>UGREEN is doubling down on AI, and is debuting Uliya, a local chatbot that uses data stored on the NAS to surface relevant information. There's universal search and an AI-assisted data organization features as well, and I'll have to test the NAS to see how these hold up in real-world use.</p><p>While I'm usually reticent to recommend pre-ordering a high-end NAS, UGREEN has proven over the last two years that it knows what it's doing in this category, and having used the DXP6800 Pro and DXP8800 Plus for close to a year now, I can say with some confidence that they're the best NAS models I've ever used, and I can't wait to get my hands on the iDX6011 and iDX6011 Pro.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Xreal is now the main hardware partner for Google’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> ecosystem.</p><p>Google’s XR journey has had its ups and downs, starting with the promise and later retreat of Google Glass, followed by years of quiet work as others moved ahead. Things shifted late last year when Google launched Android XR, a new operating system for devices ranging from mixed-reality headsets to lightweight AR glasses.</p><p>The first products focused on bigger devices, like Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset, but Google has made it clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">glasses</a>, not large headsets, are the real goal.</p><h2 id="google-s-ar-focus-is-on-glasses-2">Google's AR focus is on glasses</h2><p>This is where Xreal fits in. The company is known for making AR glasses that are ready for everyday use, not just prototypes. With this expanded partnership, Xreal becomes Google’s main hardware partner for "optical see-through devices."</p><p>Google and Xreal will now co-develop hardware roadmaps, align software features with physical design, and ensure Android XR apps work as people expect when projected into real space.</p><p>The first tangible result of that collaboration is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">Project Aura</a>, a new pair of Android XR glasses slated to arrive in 2026. These aren’t just prototypes. They’re built to give a wide field of view, about 70 degrees, while staying connected to an external computer. This keeps the glasses themselves light.</p><p>Android XR includes familiar Android development tools, supports OpenXR, and is closely integrated with Gemini AI. Google believes this is key to hands-free, context-aware computing.</p><p>It’s still early days for Android XR. The platform is new, developer tools are still improving, and useful apps will take time to arrive. Still, the direction is clear, with Google setting the stage for XR devices people will actually want to wear.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Oura is trying to solve two problems with this charging case: first, the on-the-go issue that many of its Members have reportedly informed it about. Second, not relying on the charger in their house so often. Oura states that its charging case can hold up to "five full charges," meaning users could, in theory, go "weeks" without needing the wall plug-in charger.</p><p>While you're busy charging your Oura Ring, users will need to charge their case, too. The post states that the case is provided with a USB-C cable for its charging needs.</p><p>In "under 90 minutes," the case is reported to reach its maximum charge. Additionally, your Oura Ring is estimated to reach its maximum in roughly 20-80 minutes, depending on what its percentage is at the start. Users can check their ring's charge via the Oura app.</p><p>The charging case was crafted with recycled aluminum, making it resistant to splashes. More importantly, since this is designed for a smart ring, Oura states the case is rather small, making it the perfect size to slip into your pocket.</p><p>The charging case is compatible with the Oura Ring 4 and the Ring 4 Ceramic. The company states that the case will start at $99, available at ouraring.com and "select" online retailers.</p><h2 id="grab-n-go-2">Grab 'N Go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD" name="Oura-Ring-4-charging-case" alt="Oura launches it's first ever charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you missed it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case">the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic launched</a> this past fall, bringing those mood ring vibes you might feel nostalgic about. Sporting a glass aesthetic, the Ring 4 Ceramic still offers the same health features consumers have come to expect and know from Oura. The ring measures 7.9mm in width; however, it is slightly thicker (3.51mm) due to its zirconia ceramic material. Regardless, consumers can find the device in Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight.</p><p>Concerning its features, Oura recently introduced its Health Panel for $99 in-app, bringing 50+ cardiometabolic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-ring-users-can-now-access-over-50-blood-biomarkers-for-usd99">blood markers tracking</a> capabilities.</p><p>Oura states that this provides a more comprehensive look into a person's body, as it integrates insights from your Ring with those cardiometabolic blood markers. Oura stated that it wanted to truly focus on delivering the "what" and "why" behind what users see. As an example, Oura states that if a user's A1C is creeping up on them, they're immediately able to see what might've affected that. Think about your sleeping habits, eating habits, and the like.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While Motorola's best efforts are focused on foldable Razr models like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Razr Fold</a>, it still has plenty to offer with regular phones. In fact, Motorola is ready to challenge the status quo, and the brand is rolling out the Signature, a new series that aims to hold up against the likes of the OnePlus 15.</p><p>I was able to use the Signature at CES 2026, and while I haven't tested Motorola phones in a few years, I don't remember the manufacturer's devices being this good. That OnePlus comparison is apt, as the Signature immediately feels like OnePlus devices of yesteryear. The sleek design with a thickness of just 6.9mm along with the rectangular camera island reminds me of the OnePlus 10 Pro, and the in-hand feel is similar as well. While it has flat sides, the subtle bevels make the phone highly comfortable to hold and use, and it just feels better than the chunkier Vivo X300 and Find X9.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xVxYWP43au9rC7w2wcyonR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xVxYWP43au9rC7w2wcyonR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, that's also down to the fact that the Signature has a smaller 5,200mAh battery. Thankfully, Motorola is using silicon-carbon tech, so you get better density — leading to a thinner phone — and better durability in challenging weather conditions. I wasn't able to test that as I used the Signature in a comfortable (albeit harshly lit) briefing area in Las Vegas, but seeing as how it also has IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, it should hold up to any adverse weather just as well as other Android phones.</p><p>Motorola had the green and black models of the Signature available, and I like the green option — it just has a better presence, and the brushed metal around the camera island contrasts well with the color. The Signature gets a 6.8-inch AMOLED panel, and it comes with all the other extras that you'd normally see in a high-end phone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XvdqAwMKaLrE66dgMnxYES" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvdqAwMKaLrE66dgMnxYES.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DdMM5YxXxcCKYVBngZ5uDS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DdMM5YxXxcCKYVBngZ5uDS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G8V3nWKthtE2jicyQ8WTfR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8V3nWKthtE2jicyQ8WTfR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EjxK3mv8yH8FjvziRLE7fR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EjxK3mv8yH8FjvziRLE7fR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N4rSBDjVh5vfyMYQxTiYBS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4rSBDjVh5vfyMYQxTiYBS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Now, what I particularly like with the Signature is the cameras; the phone gets a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 main camera with OIS, alongside a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-600 3x zoom lens (also with OIS), and a 50MP wide-angle lens. The cameras are the same as the Razr Fold, and the switch to Sony lenses should give the Signature a considerable advantage over yesteryear Motorola phones.</p><p>The Signature doesn't quite have the latest hardware, with Motorola choosing to go with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 instead of the Elite. Now, while I would normally have an issue with that, I don't think it is a big downside. The 8 Gen 5 has plenty of power in its own right, and Motorola said going with the platform allowed it to lower the cost of the phone, putting it on par with the OnePlus 15 (which does have the Elite).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKQEC6ePD52BQgG38yKmtR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKQEC6ePD52BQgG38yKmtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage, with the phone going up to 16GB/1TB should you need increased storage. The 5,200mAh battery uses Motorola's standard 90W charging tech, and the phone doesn't miss out on any of the other extras — it even gets UWB.</p><p>Motorola's software stance with the Signature is refreshing to say the least, with the phone guaranteed to get seven years of updates. I confirmed with Motorola that it means seven Android OS updates, so the phone is in line with Google and Samsung devices in this regard, and that's just great to see considering all the missteps the brand made in the past.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4XuRbcFj9QyStscGuXr6BS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XuRbcFj9QyStscGuXr6BS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GXZsG7Nbcxwg9y8csiiZuR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXZsG7Nbcxwg9y8csiiZuR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DXYAjQuNpJU7c2VGtWVbqR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DXYAjQuNpJU7c2VGtWVbqR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If anything, using the Signature convinced me that Motorola has a great product on its hands, and it has the potential to be an alternative to the OnePlus 15 and Galaxy S25.</p><p>There's just one issue: Motorola isn't launching the Signature in the U.S. The phone is going on sale in other global markets, where prices start at €999.

Although several leaks have already hinted at what to expect from the next flagship lineup, the exact launch window for the series has remained uncertain.</p><p>Some leakers previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-series-might-arrive-jan-2025">suggested a January 2026 launch</a>, albeit later than usual, while others claimed Samsung had pushed the announcement to February 2026. Now, reliable tipster Evan Blass has effectively confirmed that Samsung will host the Galaxy S26 launch event on February 25, 2026.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/2008647312139243594">post on X</a>, Blass stated that the date of February 25 is "100% correct" for the Galaxy S26 series launch. Blass was quoting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2006658430468239377">post from @UniverseIce</a>, which mentioned that Samsung will not be changing Galaxy S26 pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-entire-galaxy-s26-series-could-cost-usd50-more-than-the-galaxy-s25">as previously rumored</a>. That same post also claimed the launch will take place in San Francisco, U.S., with sales beginning in early March.</p><p>While Blass did not comment further on pricing, he did reiterate that the Galaxy S26 series will debut on February 25, 2026.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-galaxy-s26-launch-date-may-finally-be-set-2">Samsung's Galaxy S26 launch date may finally be set</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's still unclear why Samsung is launching the Galaxy S26 series later than usual. However, rumors suggest the company made a late decision during development to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">replace the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> with the standard Galaxy S26 Plus, which may have contributed to the delay. Either way, it appears we are now less than two months away from the official launch.</p><p>As for the devices themselves, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/caught-on-camera-could-this-be-the-samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-weve-been-waiting-for">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> is expected to feature a refined version of the Galaxy S25 Ultra design, along with upgrades such as a larger battery and faster charging support of up to 60W. The Galaxy S26 lineup could also be the first Samsung smartphones to support Qi2 out of the box.</p><p>Powering the series will reportedly be the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in the U.S., while Samsung is expected to use its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-exynos-2600-official">Exynos 2600</a> for the base and Plus models in select markets, such as Asia and Europe.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Meanwhile, Google has opted solely for book-style foldables and Samsung has invested in both. Now, Motorola is shaking up its lineup with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">introduction of the Razr Fold</a>, the company's first book-style foldable phone, which is set to launch later this year.</p><p>This gives consumers another option while allowing Motorola to cater to a different type of consumer, one that prefers the flexibility of a large tablet-like foldable phone. But with that in mind, we want to know what style foldable you prefer; the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> or the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">book-style foldable</a>?</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-XbL5YW"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/XbL5YW.js" async></script><h2 id="very-different-form-factors-for-very-different-purposes-2">Very different form factors for very different purposes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qmMDRrLXfwiavZT8Tx2A3F" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmMDRrLXfwiavZT8Tx2A3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3965" height="2230" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are many differences between flip phones and book-style foldables, starting with their size.</p><p>Flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> aim to minimize their footprint by folding in half form the size of a regular smartphone to a square-like device with an outer screen. That outer screen can be used to view notifications, and on newer, more advanced flip phones, interact with messages, open apps, take selfies, and much more. You also get the nostalgia of being able to flip the phone open or dramatically shut it closed, which is still very fun.</p><p>Meanwhile, book-style foldables, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, are geared towards productivity, media, and multitasking. They start at the size of a regular smartphone and open to something much larger and with more screen real estate. This makes it easy to run apps side-by-side, drag and drop content between apps, or open up your most-used apps directly from a task bar, not unlike a tablet or desktop.</p><p>And if you want to watch videos or draw, the larger screen is an ideal canvas for both.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, beyond size and use-cases, price is also a factor. Flip phones tend to be cheaper, which makes them much more accessible. It's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-foldable-phone-failure-is-over-why-2026-is-set-to-change-everything">they have lead foldable sales for years, until recently</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, book-style foldables are much more expensive, with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> reaching $2,000, and we're not even going into multi-fold devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>.

The company touts the stylus as a "natural extension" of one's hand. If you're one to sketch, the Pen Ultra delivers several features that artists can lean on, like its pressure sensitivity. This feature reflects your touch, similar to if you're pressing harder on your pen or pencil in real life. Moreover, users will find that tilting the pen will affect their shading and texture.</p><p>Motorola built in some protections for its Pen Ultra, stating that users who may rest their hand on their device while drawing won't have their artwork ruined, thanks to its palm-rejection technology.</p><p>If you're jotting down notes, users can document those thoughts, as well as "smart features to transform text or images."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="XoH9DUPgf8Xahf7nnsFQN" name="moto-pen-ultra-with-case-example" alt="The Motorola Pen Ultra in black with its carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoH9DUPgf8Xahf7nnsFQN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another key feature you'll find with the Pen Ultra is the "quick access toolbar." Pretty self-explanatory; however, Motorola states this bar lets users customize their pen to their liking. Users can select from a range of brushes before/during sketching and magnify their screen to add those finer details.</p><p>Elsewhere, you'll find features such as Quick Clip for highlighting content, Speed Share, Sketch to Image, and Circle to Search from Google. Motorola's Pen Ultra is a standalone accessory, meaning it will be delivered with a carrying case and a "total battery backup." Motorola claims the pen can last all day.</p><p>The Moto Pen Ultra is slated to debut in the North American market "in the coming months." Motorola states it will provide additional details during that time.</p><h2 id="moto-watch-2026-edition-2">Moto Watch, 2026 edition</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y6d4xP6RMSWdLSHtM9LoGC" name="moto-watch-2026-ces-lifestyle" alt="The Moto Watch (2026) on a model's wrist with a Volcanic ash band." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y6d4xP6RMSWdLSHtM9LoGC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8640" height="4860" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's announcement trifecta includes a new Watch, but this one features its first partnership with Polar.</p><p>Polar is a company that excels at wearable sports and fitness technology, which gives us an inkling into where Motorola wants to lean with the Watch this year. With a round 47mm watch face, the newest Moto Watch features a 13-day battery life (depending on usage). This face is set upon a sand-blasted aluminum frame with a stainless steel crown.</p><p>Inside the device, users will find a "personal wellness companion" that is capable of logging steps, helping you manage your stress, and providing insights to understand your sleep quality. Polar's involvement is stated to "offer users deep health insights and wellness tracking solutions." Users can log their calories, track workouts (Activity Score, Activity Goal), and more.</p><p>The Moto Watch monitors your heart rate, blood oxygen, and delivers options to set/customize goals and more.</p><p>A hands-free experience greets the Moto Watch this new year with a built-in mic and speaker system. Not only does this help with its AI software, but users can take calls and receive audio notifications whenever they're not near their phone, good for those cooking or cleaning around the house.</p><p>The Moto Watch with a PANTONE Volcanic Ash band will be available on motorola.com on January 22 in the U.S.</p><h2 id="tag-2-you-re-it-and-a-sound-flow-too-2">Tag (2), you're it — and a Sound Flow, too!</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Frej3dhpTKTVTyPeHTuLLH" name="moto-tag-2-lifestyle-bicycle" alt="The Moto Tag 2 clipped onto the underside of a bicycle's seat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Frej3dhpTKTVTyPeHTuLLH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4685" height="2635" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1334px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.31%;"><img id="qoUYauM7pLRpHMGdEreesM" name="moto-sound-flow-bluetooth-speaker" alt="The Motorola Sound Flow Bluetooth speaker in PANTONE Carbon and Warm Taupe." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoUYauM7pLRpHMGdEreesM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1334" height="471" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Motorola's next iteration of smart tracking is here, as the company unveiled its Moto Tag 2 at CES 2026.</p><p>Keeping its lightweight body, Motorola states its second Tag offers ~500 days of battery life, meaning you'll know where your stuff is for well over a year. Speaking of that, the Moto Tag 2 has been equipped with even more security to defend your items. The press release states that the tracker leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) and channel-sounding technology to locate missing items. UWB comes in for precise location tracking and direction detection.</p><p>Users can lean on the Moto Tag app or Google's Find Hub to see all of their tracked devices, easily available for rediscovery.</p><p>While typically popped into a suitcase or set on a keychain, Motorola says its Tag 2 can work the opposite way to find your lost phone. Even if your phone was on silent, users can press the Tag 2's button, and it'll set off your phone's ringer. The tracker's physical button is even used as a remote camera shutter. What's more, users can share their tracker's location with trusted friends and family.</p><p>The Moto Tag 2 is headed for North America "in the coming months."</p><p>Lastly, Motorola is launching a Bluetooth speaker, paired with Bose, called the Moto Sound Flow. With Sound by Bose, the Sound Flow features a 20W subwoofer and a 10W tweeter with Dual Passive radiators. Though a surprising launch, Motorola isn't holding anything back, stating the speaker features Room Shift, Quick Switch, Dynamic Stereo, Stereo Pairing, and Hands-free calling.</p><p>Additionally, there are captive touch buttons on the speaker.</p><p>Users can easily cast to the Sound Flow via Google Cast, Spotify Connect, and AirPlay. For those long jam sessions, the speaker features a 6,000mAh battery, which is estimated to last up to 12 hours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a> was revealed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ces">CES 2026</a>, with Motorola teasing a new stylus pen alongside it, though the company didn't reveal everything.</p><p>It seems Motorola is keeping many of the specs and details under wraps, while giving us enough to get us excited. So while there's a lot we don't know about the Razr Fold, here's what we do know and what we can glean as we wait for the full launch of Motorola's first book-style foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-price-and-availability"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="C95EgMznpMpJ4NkSe62GhK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-1" alt="A man and woman looking at the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C95EgMznpMpJ4NkSe62GhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is keeping pretty mum about the pricing and availability of the Razr Fold. However, we can infer from what we've seen in the market and from Motorola's current foldables.</p><p>Regarding price, Motorola hasn't confirmed it, but we wouldn't be surprised if the phone were priced around $1,799. This would pit it directly with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> while undercutting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">rising DRAM prices</a> could affect this, but we also know that Motorola usually prefers to match or undercut its competition to make its devices more appealing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/2008413915147800608">One rumor</a> points to Motorola taking things even further by starting prices as low as $1,500, which would be quite impressive.</p><p>As for availability, the Razr Fold will arrive later this year, with summer as the target launch date, although Motorola says we will learn more about the phone "in the coming months." That would pit the phone against Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-design"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8vFwWFnsQmhv4hkW6fDajK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-3" alt="A woman holding the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vFwWFnsQmhv4hkW6fDajK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2133" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the Razr Fold resembles a mix of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with a dash of Motorola. The overall chassis doesn't look too different from many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market. The outer 6.6-inch display appears to have a similar aspect ratio to a non-folding smartphone, while the inner 8.1-inch panel features a single camera in the top right corner. The corners are also not very rounded, with bumpers lining the inner display.</p><p>Where things differ from other foldables is the rear panel. Instead of glass, Motorola appears to be opting for vegan leather, although with seemingly different finishes for both the Pantone Blackened Blue and Pantone Lily White color options.</p><p>Motorola is also giving the Razr Fold its signature camera design, with what appears to be an aluminum housing that protrudes from the back panel. This is similar to Motorola's phones over the past few years, particularly its flagships.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tgEuC6YVQ8w6zQQjFtvFTH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgEuC6YVQ8w6zQQjFtvFTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What we don't know is how thin the Razr Fold is. Thinness has become a major focus over the past year, particularly on foldable phones, which led to the impressive 4.6mm-thin Galaxy Z Fold 7. Fortunately, the Razr Fold looks thin enough to compete with the best of them, aside from the camera protrusion.</p><p>Another thing we notice is the button layout. While the typical power and volume buttons are present, there's also a fourth button, which is likely an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-specs"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Specs</span></h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Hello UI/Android 16 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>8.1-inch, 2K, LTPO</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>6.6-inch</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB LPDDR5X (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB or 1TB, UFS 4.1 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP Sony LYTIA sensor</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP ultrawide/macro</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP 3x periscope telephoto</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera (internal)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>20MP</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera (external)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>32MP</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, NFC, UWB (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & charging</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Pantone Blackened Blue, Pantone Lily White</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>So far, Motorola hasn't revealed much of the Razr Fold specs, but some have been confirmed (emboldened in the above spec sheet), including the display sizes and camera resolutions. The inner display will feature a 2K resolution, and while it's not clear what the external display resolution will be, we can probably expect a Full HD+ resolution.</p><p>As for the cameras, we're looking at a triple 50MP system with an unidentified Sony Lytia sensor for the primary camera, which will be capable of Dolby Vision recording. The ultrawide camera doubles as a macro sensor, while the telephoto sensor features 3x optical zoom. There are also two selfie cameras, with a 20MP sensor on the inner display and a 32MP sensor on the external screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything else is assumed or unknown. Given its positioning, the foldable is expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, Qualcomm's latest, along with 16GB of RAM. However, it's possible Motorola could opt for the slightly underpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> to keep the price down. This would help it achieve the rumored $1,500 price tag.</p><p>Battery capacity is unknown, though we hope Motorola will take what it's learned from the Edge 70 and use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon battery</a> for a thinner, denser pack, maybe 5,000mAh or more. It's also likely the Razr Fold will follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and other flagship Motorola phones and feature 68W wired charging. Qi2-support is another unknown, however.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-software"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xgowVchHtquofMr9ziBtwK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-4" alt="Motorola Razr Fold folded at an angle with a keyboard and notepad on the display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xgowVchHtquofMr9ziBtwK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Razr Fold will likely run the latest version of Hello UX, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. Given that this is the company's first book-style foldable, we expect the software to adapt to the larger internal display to make better use of the screen real estate, with features like a taskbar for pinned apps. Motorola highlights as much, noting that the Razr Fold will feature flexible layouts, adaptive interfaces, and multitasking enhancements.</p><p>Motorola also highlights AI features available on the Fold. This includes current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features like Catch me up and Next Move, but it will likely also include Motorola Qira, the company's upgraded AI solution. This will enable features that work across devices for better productivity and contextual awareness.</p><p>That said, we hope Motorola's software update promise will grow this year. Right now, its U.S.-based phones are supported for as long as four years, while other companies promise up to seven years.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-moto-pen-ultra"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Moto Pen Ultra</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XzMKJzaAF3F8TaqKSFd3mK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-2" alt="A woman with a sylust pen and the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XzMKJzaAF3F8TaqKSFd3mK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola also introduced the Moto Pen Ultra, a stylus pen that can basically be seen as Motorola's version of the S Pen. Unlike the passive stylus pens that are included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus</a> lineup of phones, this is an active pen with features such as tilt detection, pressure sensitivity, and even palm rejection to ensure that your sketches or other pen work go uninterrupted.</p><p>Motorola also highlights other AI-powered features, such as Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Motorola's own Sketch to Image, to give your drawings some added flair. There's also Quick Clip, which lets you easily create a new note or add to an existing one by highlighting text, and Speed Share, which suggests who to send notes or annotations to. And like the S Pen, users can access features from a quick-access toolbar.</p><p>Motorola doesn't say how long the Moto Pen Ultra lasts on a single charge, but the carrying case can fully charge the pen if needed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lenovo says the glasses support touch and voice controls for hands-free calling, can act as a teleprompter during presentations, and also offer music playback.</p><h2 id="lenovo-joins-the-ai-glasses-race-sort-of-at-ces-2026-2">Lenovo joins the AI glasses race (sort of) at CES 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kHSuZ9rCYbFPDLfF6WeV8o" name="lenovo-ai-glasses-display-1" alt="Lenovo's AI Glasses Concept with visible icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kHSuZ9rCYbFPDLfF6WeV8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The glasses also integrate Motorola's and Lenovo's new Qira AI assistant, enabling features like "sub-millisecond" live translation and image recognition. Lenovo adds that users can access the Catch Me Up feature, which can display a summary of notifications from multiple devices.</p><p>The company hasn't explicitly shared details about the display used in its AI Glasses concept. However, since the company claims the glasses can display notification summaries and has shared images showing visual output, it is likely using some form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a>-like technology.</p><p>Beyond that, Lenovo says the smart glasses weigh just 45g for comfortable all-day wear and offer up to 8 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p><p>For now, the AI Glasses remain a proof-of-concept device, and Lenovo hasn't shared any plans to bring them to market. We will update you if the company announces anything about a commercial release.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Razr Fold is launching later this year, and Motorola showcased the device at an exclusive product briefing I attended at CES 2026.</p><p>To be honest, I wasn't quite as enthused about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold">Razr Fold</a> as my colleagues; AC managing editor Derrek Lee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">adores his Razr Ultra</a>, and while I'll admit that Motorola makes good foldables, I didn't think the brand would have a particularly strong device as its debut effort in the book-style category.

That in itself is a good starting point; this is an area where Google didn't make any measurable advances with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-may-not-be-the-best-foldable-but-its-the-one-i-like-the-most">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, so it's great to see Motorola opting to go with a thin-and-light design.</p><p>The brand did all the right things with the color options as well; the Pantone Lily White model has a silky finish that feels good to hold, and the Pantone Blackened Blue variant has a distinctive texture that I prefer. Another positive is the rounded edges; they make holding and using the Razr Fold that much more comfortable, and they're just as good as the X Fold 5 in this regard.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QjqhnsGoKNYJwEQeysJGXH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjqhnsGoKNYJwEQeysJGXH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Motorola retained a similar camera island that you'll find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">its regular phones</a>, and again, I like how the brand preserved its unique design identity. The width of the camera island means there isn't much wobble when using the Razr Fold on a table — this was a bugbear on the Z Fold 7, and I'm glad that it isn't a problem with Motorola's foldable.</p><p>Continuing with the positives, there isn't much in the way of a visible crease along the inner panel. The hinge flexes smoothly and has good articulation, and on the whole, I didn't see any issues when it comes to the hardware design as such. Basically, if you covered up the Motorola logo and told me it was a Vivo or Honor foldable, I would've believed it — Motorola has a strong contender out of the gate with the Razr Fold.</p><p>The outer panel extends to 6.6 inches and is comfortable to hold. The inner 8.1-inch panel gets a 2K resolution, and at an initial glance, it is just as bright and vibrant as what Vivo and Samsung have to offer.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

the Razr Fold gets a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 module as the primary camera, and a 50MP Lytia LYT-600 as the 3x optical zoom lens.

That should make things interesting, and initial excitement around the device may just come down to how Motorola prices the foldable.

And it seems like this represents the company's push into the ultra-premium market, bringing unique materials and long-term software support to its devices.</p><p>The Motorola Signature is said to be 6.99mm thin and weighs only 186 grams. As for its design, the phone gets an aircraft-grade aluminum frame with a twill-inspired or linen-inspired finish on its rear panel. The phone features a large 6.8-inch Extreme AMOLED display that can reach 6,200 nits of brightness, and an ultra-fast 165Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Extending the device's longevity and slim build is the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone gets an IP68 and IP69  rating, much like its mid-range and flagship "Edge" series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.85%;"><img id="yJmae9jwoFNCCXESzLzRtV" name="Motorola-Signature-2026" alt="Motorola Signature arrives looking sleek, with 7 years of OS updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:281,cw:3602,ch:2026,q:80/yJmae9jwoFNCCXESzLzRtV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2026" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though the Signature is "ultra-thin," Motorola didn't compromise on its battery life.
