<p>Google is rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-popular-find-my-device-gets-a-revamp-and-notable-enhancements">redesigned Find Hub app</a> for Android users today, following its announcement at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show: I/O Edition</a> last week. The change is becoming available following a Google Play Store update for the app, which was previously named Find My Device. Find Hub better reflects the app's capabilities, as it can track devices, items, and people.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store listing</a> now reflects the name change, so you'll need to search for Find Hub to update your app. The latest version number for Find Hub is <strong>3.1.337-2</strong>, and after applying the update, you'll see the switch. Google used to shorten Find My Device to Find Device on the home screen, but now Find Hub is used everywhere.</p><p>Alongside the tweak, the <strong>People</strong> tab in the Find Hub app is out of beta following a testing period. You'll now see separate settings pages for Find Hub and Google Location Sharing when tapping your profile picture in the app after updating.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/find/" target="_blank">official website</a> still uses the Find My Device branding rather than the newer Find Hub moniker.</p><p>These minor changes are just the start of Find Hub updates set to arrive on Android devices. Later this month, the app will gain precise finding for ultra-wideband (UWB) item trackers, which will first become available on the Moto Tag. After that, Find Hub is going to support satellite connectivity starting later this year.</p><p>It's possible that we learn more about Find Hub changes at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">Google I/O 2025</a>, a developer conference happening this week.</p>

Compared to the Razr 2024, it's true that the newer model has no noticeable performance gains and reuses mostly the same design and displays.</p><p>However, Motorola picked just the right places to make just the right upgrades. And at the exact same price as prior Razr base model, that's enough to make the Razr 2025 feel like a steal. After using older Razr flagships and the multiple Samsung Galaxy Z Flip generations, I'm convinced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> is all the foldable you need.</p><p>Starting at just $700, you can pick up a Razr 2025 for way less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> while still feeling like you're getting a premium experience. I've spent nearly two weeks with the newest entry-level Motorola foldable, and I already know I can comfortably keep this phone in my pocket for the long haul.</p>

<p>At a glance, it would be difficult to tell the difference between the Motorola Razr 2025 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> model it replaces. The two phones' dimensions are nearly identical, with the newer model being slightly thinner, slightly shorter, and slightly lighter. The design changes made to the Razr 2025 are so minute that older cases will still fit — we're talking about fractions of a millimeter here.</p><p>So, what's new about the Razr 2025? There are some new colors and finish options, and I tested Pantone Lightest Sky, which is an ivory-like colorway with a refractor design. However, the major design improvements are under-the-hood upgrades you won't be able to see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-8" alt="A close-up of the Motorola Razr 2025's main display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big news is that the Razr's dust-resistance rating is back after the 2024 series' IPX8 certification forewent dust protection. Now, the Razr 2025 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP48 certified</a> against dust and liquid ingress, and that's massive for durability. Dust-resistance is specifically important for foldables, since any kind of debris getting in the hinge or under the display could be fatal for your device.</p><p>The other key design upgrade goes hand-in-hand with the IP48 rating, and that's the titanium-reinforced hinge. Past Motorola foldables utilized a stainless steel hinge, and it simply wasn't good enough compared to foldables from the likes of Samsung. Now, the hinge feels sturdier, stronger, and more satisfying to open and shut. Compared to the weaker hinge on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, the difference is night and day.</p>

<p>There aren't any other design changes to speak of, but that's not a bad thing. The base-model Razr's design was already solid. The 3.6-inch pOLED panel is plenty bright, and let's be honest, anything more than the 90Hz refresh rate supported by the cover screen would be overkill. On the inside, the 6.9-inch AMOLED is gorgeous with a 120Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The foldable display crease is still visible, and it might feel odd to slide your finger across it for the first time. But that awkwardness fades away quickly. Although there are no new display upgrades on the Razr 2025, this still feels like a fantastic set of screens for a $700 foldable.</p>

<p>While the Razr 2025 technically has a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> processor, the performance improvements may be in name only. It's still a 4nm chip, and our benchmark tests revealed that the Razr 2025 actually performs worse than the Razr 2024. Not by enough of a margin to matter, but it's worth pointing out. Also, keep in mind that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/benchmarks-are-horrible-way-gauge-performance-smartphone-and-heres-why">benchmarks don't really tell the whole story</a> when using a phone, so take what you will from these numbers.</p>

<p>There were a handful of times when I noticed the Razr 2025 lag behind, and the common denominator seemed to be fast multitasking paired with excessive heat. If I bring the smartphone outdoors in Arizona heat while streaming music, taking photos and videos, and browsing the web, the Razr 2025 might stutter here and there.</p><p>These were all minor, momentary hiccups — this foldable is by no means <em>slow</em>. But if you expect it to perform like a flagship, you'll end up a bit disappointed. The benchmark results show that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> are running laps around the base model I tested.</p><p>Meanwhile, with a 4,500mAh battery, the Razr 2025 consistently lasted a full day, which is excellent for a clamshell foldable.</p>

<p>The Razr 2025's main camera is still a 50MP, f/1.7 sensor, and it performs well in most situations. Motorola touts that this smartphone offers Pantone Validated Color and Skin Tones, which should help your Razr 2025's camera capture accurate and lifelike colors.</p><p>This ended up being mostly the case, but you'll notice in the camera samples below that Motorola's High Dynamic Range (HDR) processing can be a bit aggressive. For example, while the sunset photos and the restaurant signs I captured seem to really pop, the colors are definitely oversaturated compared to what I saw in the real world.</p>

<p>There's a lot of post-processing magic going on here, because when it doesn't work right, it's noticeable. The night skyline in the sixth photo above seemed to give the Razr 2025 trouble, because it ended up being a grainy and blurry mess.</p><p>The main camera is joined by a 13MP ultrawide lens, which is also unchanged this year. By default, you can shoot in 0.5x, 1x, and 2x zoom lengths, and anything further will heavily rely on digital zoom. Unfortunately, there's no telephoto lens.</p>

<p>To be clear, the Motorola Razr 2025's camera isn't bad. It's actually quite good when you consider that this is a space-constrained foldable at a midrange price point. However, I would've liked to see less-aggressive color science and a more natural look to some of the photos.</p>

<p>There's no avoiding the fact that the Razr 2025 is overloaded with AI. There are at least four AI suites offered on this smartphone: Moto AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Perplexity, and Copilot. If you don't want to use any of these AI features, that's perfectly fine. The Moto AI features require a Motorola account, so just stay signed out if you'd rather not see them. Plus, it's quick and easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">change the double-press of the home button</a> from an AI launcher to a camera launcher.</p><p>I personally didn't enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI experience</a> on the Razr 2025, mostly because the device is too underpowered to process AI queries in a fast and secure manner. For instance, Catch Me Up — a feature that summarizes your notifications — needs to send them to a cloud server for processing before you can get the low-down on what you missed. Not only is the delay inconvenient, the cloud processing could be a privacy concern.</p><p>For what it's worth, Motorola says data sent to its cloud servers is always encrypted, and that data won't be shared with third-party AI assistant apps. That won't be enough for everyone to trust the service, however.</p>

<p>You should know that it's incredibly easy to use the Razr 2025 without ever touching an AI feature, so these criticisms shouldn't be a dealbreaker. The truth is, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is an excellent AI assistant, and it's all I need. For me, the standard Gemini experience is enough to forget about Moto AI, Perplexity, and Copilot.</p><p>What <em>may</em> be a dealbreaker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">the Razr 2025's software support window</a>. It covers just three years of Android OS upgrades and an extra year of security updates. That's short compared to other phones in this price range from Google and Samsung. Motorola's track record of shipping timely and bug-free software updates isn't great, either, although it has improved some as of late.</p>

<p>My final nitpick is that the rear camera lenses are a dust and fingerprint magnet due to how far they protrude from the screen. Be prepared to clean them often, especially if you use cover screen apps in full-screen mode.</p>

<p>For now, the Razr 2025's main competition in the U.S. is the last-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. It's already discounted to $600, and will only get cheaper. Usually, I'd recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">picking up the older model</a> and saving a few bucks, but not this time. By picking the Razr 2024, you'll get one fewer OS upgrade (since the first was used for Android 15), no dust resistance, a smaller battery, and a weaker hinge. The savings aren't worth what you'd have to give up.</p>
<p>If you have a Razr Plus 2023 or older, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">the base Razr 2025 will surprisingly be worth the upgrade</a>.

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a compact and versatile phone with few compromises</li><li>You need a brand-new phone priced at well under $1,000</li><li>You want a foldable with unrestricted cover screen access</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need more than three years of Android OS upgrades</li><li>You find Moto AI more of a nuisance than a helper</li><li>You want a larger and more useful cover screen</li></ul>
<p>There are more than a few reasons to stop and think about whether the Motorola Razr 2025's compromises are worth it. Motorola's sketchy track record with software updates concerns me, and the three-year OS update promise falls short of modern expectations. Moto AI might not be as secure as you'd like, and the cover screen is less capable than the one you'll find on a Plus or Ultra model.</p><p>When all is said and done, I think all these points are forgivable when you consider the Razr 2025's affordable price of entry. Paying $700 or less for a phone sure to last you <em>at least</em> four years is a pretty solid deal. Even if you have the money to spend on a more expensive phone, the Razr 2025 finds a value sweet spot. None of the missing features from the Plus 2025 or Ultra 2025 variants significantly hamper the experience.</p><p>If I had carte blanche to choose a clamshell foldable, I'd choose the Motorola Razr 2025 because of its stellar price-to-performance ratio.</p>

Veteran developers and VR publisher Creature just debuted four brand new games in its Creature Feature showcase on IGN, plus a handful of other titles that you will be looking forward to once you see them.</p><p>While most of these games are VR-only, two of them are also making their debut on non-VR systems in the very near future. But all of them are playable on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, which means all you'll need to do is wishlist these and get excited for the future!</p>

<p>Seemingly, everyone loves the Nintendo classic Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series, and Adepts banks on that feeling of nostalgia and elemental charm to immediately draw players into its gorgeous world. But you won't be The Avatar in this game. Rather, you're a powerful Earth Adept soldier who can unearth the rocks all around them in martial combat.</p><p>As you progress through the story, you'll unlock new powers as you achieve mastery over your earth powers. Adepts Arena is a single-player adventure, despite what the name might imply, so no PvP earth bending action just yet.</p><p>This one is debuting on the Meta Quest in VR (obviously), but is also going to be available on Steam with VR and flat screen support. Non-VR Steam gamers will control it like a traditional FPS, while VR gamers are treated to an immersive, active martial arts-style simulation. If you've ever wanted to weave the ways of the Earth Benders from Avatar, this is looking to be your best bet when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://giantstridegames.com/adepts-arena_en.php">hopefully debuts later this year</a>!</p>

<p>Next up is a multiplayer-focused co-op horror game that'll keep you running as fast as possible through haunted mines in an effort to try to deliver as many packages as possible. You and up to three other human-controlled goblins will take on dangerous shifts to deliver packages come Hell or high water. Hey, no one said being a Prime delivery person was easy!</p><p>Of course, things aren't as straightforward as delving down and dropping packages at doorsteps. Traps are laid along the way to prevent intruders of all kinds, and not all goblins are the nice kind, either. This is the game I'm most excited about in the whole showcase, as I'm just imagining all the fun I'll be having with friends on a Friday evening.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/deadly-delivery/8778947438836641/">Meta Quest page</a> for more info and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadlydelivery.com/">the official website</a> to sign up for the closed beta!</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a> is one of my favorite VR games of all time, but wouldn't it be nice to get a change of scenery every once in a while? Crossings, a new game by the folks who brought us the Budget Cuts series — some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> ever — are back with a new co-op action-adventure roguelite that'll test your skills with the blade in a way I've only ever seen from the VR classic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/until-you-fall-review">Until You Fall</a>.</p><p>As you'd expect from a roguelite, each level and area is procedurally generated to deliver a new experience every time. Unlike most roguelites, however, your only goal isn't just to become stronger. In Crossings, you'll delve into a story of the Norse afterlife, finding hidden stories and rebuilding the memory of your lost village. In essence, it sounds more like a mix of Hades story-heavy quest and the near-storyless world of Dungeons of Eternity rolled into one title.</p><p>Crossings can be played single-player or with friends, ensuring that you can enjoy the game even if your friends aren't available. A demo is coming to Steam Next Fest in June with a full release on Steam and Meta Quest later this year.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about how you could make the word "rose" from the word "rooster?" Or maybe turning the word "pineapple" into two different words, "apple" and "pen?" It's these strange questions that keep us up at night that led to the creation of Wordbound, a fantastic new mixed reality word game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kettle.games/">coming soon to the Meta Quest platform</a>.</p><p>Each level features a visual puzzle that needs to be solved by deconstructing the available objects into their letters, then rearranging them into the solution object. In one scene, a bowl of three apples needs a fourth to be full, so you deconstruct a plane and a pig, sort the letters, then smash them together to make an apple. It's a brilliant concept that can be played entirely one-handed, so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-casual-meta-quest-games">wake up and chill</a> with a great brain starter.</p>

<p>John Williams might be the person you think of as the "Star Wars maestro," but a new Maestro in town might just be a Duel of the Fates you've always wanted. That's right, Star Wars is coming to Maestro, one of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/two-meta-quest-rhythm-games-that-rival-beat-saber">favorite VR rhythm games of all time</a>, and the DLC includes none other than the Duel of the Fates track by John Williams, plus a new environment and even a cool little lightsaber baton to conduct with.</p><p>It'll be available on June 20 when the game also launches on PSVR 2 for the first time.</p>

<p>Check out the full Creature Feature Showcase above to see everything else that was announced, including an updated release date for Laser Dance, preorder discounts on Prison Boss Prohibition, the latest Light Brigade update, and news about Thrasher coming to flat screen systems.</p><p>And you can't forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a>, which debuted last Fall and remains one of the coolest, most convincing mixed reality games you can play today. Creature is launching a vinyl soundtrack from the game soon, letting you chill out to the vaporwave tunes after you've landed your starship.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm seems to have put some chatter to rest after it announced at Computex 2025 that the next Snapdragon Summit will take place this September. It will be a two-day summit held between Sept. 23 and 25 in Hawaii (first reported by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-confirms-late-September-launch-for-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1019401.0.html"> Notebook Check</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, "there's a good chance we could see the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Snapdragon-X-Elite-2-New-rumour-predicts-up-to-a-22-performance-uplift.999825.0.html">Snapdragon X Elite 2</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X2-Elite-Leak-reveals-chip-with-18-cores-48-GB-RAM-and-support-for-graphics-cards.971101.0.html">Snapdragon X2 Elite</a>) laptop chips debut here."</p><p>Several rumors that we saw around April this year also indicated that Qualcomm is working on a "Snapdragon 8 Elite 2," and its reveal could occur earlier toward the end of September.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.44%;"><img id="XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 is expected to be more potent than the first-generation chipset. The website adds that it will keep its 6 + 2 CPU configuration and use an Adreno GPU that is up to 30% faster and has a 26% higher AnTuTu score.</p><p>It is important to note that despite having a rumored same "internal schedule" to launch the chip, the second-gen Elite is expected to show up a month earlier than its predecessor, which was launched in October last year.</p><p>Other rumors have indicated that the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could achieve 5GHz speeds for its main core and is tipped to come with Qualcomm's "enhanced Pegasus cores." The chip may come paired with the Adreno 840 GPU for a strong gaming experience, as well as LPDDR6 RAM support.</p><p>Smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 are expected to launch in October 2025. These phones include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Xiaomi-16-Leak-reveals-details-of-next-gen-compact-phone-with-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1014013.0.html">Xiaomi 16</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-15-tipped-to-launch-with-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2-ultra-slim-bezels-and-lower-display-resolution-than-OnePlus-13.1014408.0.html">OnePlus 15</a>, Realme GT8 Pro, and many others.</p><p>Lastly, the website also notes that Samsung might not use the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 since Qualcomm will allegedly make a chip specifically for the Galaxy, like it did for the Galaxy S25 series. Which means that the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26"> Galaxy S26 series</a> could show up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">Exynos 2600 SoC</a>, and previous rumors have indicated that this chip has been pushed into mass production.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out a "Search History" function in Gemini, letting users rediscovery past chats with keywords and topics.</li><li>When viewing results, Gemini will show what the original query was to it, alongside a glimpse of what you've search for before clicking.</li><li>Gemini's recent updates have brought more personalization to users, like the ability for the AI save your info and ways to "tailor" its responses to you.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Gemini app is slowly receiving a small addition to its portfolio that brings rediscovery of past encounters.</p><p>The addition, discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/19/gemini-app-chat-search/">9to5Google</a>, is reportedly tucked into Gemini's side panel (left side). If it's not already open, users can access this by clicking the hamburger menu icon at the top left corner. Now, from there, users will find a small, new magnifying glass. Gemini opens its "Search History" page with a search bar near its center.</p><p>If you know what you're looking for, or a keyword, you can input it there and Gemini will produce what it's found after a brief moment.</p><p>The number of results is stated right beneath the bar. What's more, every instance of the keyword or topic you've searched for will be highlighted in the results. The highlighted portion is simply pulled from whatever Gemini's response was to your old search, which is made apparent as it acts as the title for each result.</p><p>When clicking, users are quickly taken to that old chat with Gemini to see everything they've discussed in full.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-s-recent-history-2">Gemini's Recent History</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.94%;"><img id="kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX" name="google-gemini-search-history-example" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "Search History," which will deliver results based on your search about older chats for rediscovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="924" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini would already show a variation of your chat history with it in the side panel. Under "Recent," users could see a handful of old chats, and clicking "Show More" would act as expected. However, this view is quite limited, meaning if you interact with Gemini often, you're going to miss those really old chats.</p><p>We've noticed Gemini's search function on our end, so users should begin noticing it more and more today and through the week.</p><p>Gemini's Search History introduction is wrapped in Google's previous string of more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-free-version-now-supports-saved-info-for-personalized-responses">personalized</a>" updates for the AI model experience. Earlier this year, Google rolled out an update for Gemini Advanced that saves your information. This information encompasses whatever you've given the AI, like if you're a vegetarian, if you'd prefer responses in a different language, what your profession is, and more.</p><p>All of this is retained, so you don't have to reiterate these key points later. This is an opt-in option. If you don't want Gemini to remember things about you, it doesn't have to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">a major update about Gemini</a> in March, which also touched on becoming more personal for users. This additional bit of personalization is powered by the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model, bringing your other apps into the model. From there, Google says Gemini <em>can </em>leverage your behavior in Search and other areas to "tailor" its responses in a way that fits you.</p><p>Still, users remain in control and can disable this function if preferred.</p>

<ul><li>Google's NotebookLM debuts on Android, bringing AI-powered summarized information to a mobile app.</li><li>The app brings Audio Overviews and the ability for users to upload source information from anywhere on their device.</li><li>Google confirmed a standalone app was on the way earlier in May during its Gemini 2.5 Flash integration.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's AI-powered note-taking program., NotebookLM, is finally debuting on Android.</p><p>The Google NotebookLM app for Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">appeared on the Play Store</a> earlier this morning (May 19). The program specializes in condensing lengthy, chunky pieces of research into more bite-sized, manageable notes for users. With it rolling out on the Play Store, Google highlights users' ability to "create and view" notebooks on the go. NotebookLM becomes "an expert" on the topics you feed it.</p><p>Its app details state it will "summarize them" (your notes) and make "interesting connections," which are all things it does on its desktop and mobile website.</p><p>A major highlight of the NotebookLM Android app is the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>. Instead of reading through what the AI has condensed, AI Overviews creates a radio talk show-like experience with two AI hosts that deliver the information to you. Moreover, the AI's discussion will still feature those unique connections, just in a conversational format. Details state users can "join" those discussions, likely to put forward their questions vocally.</p><p>Alternatively, if you're reading through NotebookLM's summary, users can type their questions and receive "answers with in-line citations."</p>

<p>Google drew attention to Android users' ability to quickly share files in the NotebookLM app. For example, if you've got a PDF handy that you've found, users can "share" it and find the NotebookLM logo there as an option. This will easily bring it into the AI's domain, where it will begin to deconstruct it, summarizing key points for talking points later.</p><p>The app has appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">on the Play Store</a> today (May 19); however, it's unclear if/when it will arrive on the App Store for iOS.</p><p>Late last year, Google updated NotebookLM's Audio Overviews, bringing users on a desktop an easier way to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">guide</a>" its AI hosts. This arrived via a "customize" button, letting users choose what the AI should focus on. This gives users a way to ensure the AI is talking about the points they're most interested in, rather than unnecessarily rambling on about every minute detail.</p><p>Google also included support for background listening, making it even easier for users to listen as they go.</p><p>It seems the company couldn't wait to debut NotebookLM on Android after it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-gets-gemini-2-5-flash-as-it-prepares-to-launch-as-a-standalone-app">confirmed as much</a> earlier in May. During that announcement, the app picked up Gemini 2.5 Flash integration to enable multi-step reasoning capabilities. To explain, 2.5 Flash should give NotebookLM more "comprehensive answers" when users ask complex questions. The company's update included an Output Language setting, too, letitng users decide what language they'd prefer to receive answers in.</p>

<p>When it comes to affordable smartphones, Motorola and Xiaomi are easily among the most popular brands out there. However, the product portfolios of these companies comprise some truly premium devices as well, with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Xiaomi Mix Flip being two such products.</p><p>Both are flip-style foldables that come with just about everything you could possibly want in a top-tier smartphone, including powerhouse hardware, feature-laden software with lots of AI-based tools, and much more. While the Razr Ultra 2025 is Motorola's latest and most expensive product of its kind, the Mix Flip is Xiaomi's first offering in the clamshell foldable segment and is nearly a year old at this point. The former is also much easier to get your hands on, whereas the latter remains limited in terms of availability. So, the question is, which of these two foldables is overall a better option?</p><p>Let's take a comparative look at the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip and find out.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-design-displays-and-hardware-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Design, displays, and hardware</h2>
<p>Motorola has been making foldables for a while now, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is its finest offering yet. The smartphone's back panel comes in three different finishes (vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood) and there are four colors to choose from. You also get a titanium-reinforced hinge for improved durability, as well as an IP48 certification for better ingress protection.</p><p>The cover display is a 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED panel that comes with a refresh rate of up to 165Hz and is secured with a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The inner folding display is a 7.0-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also has a 165Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-24" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to a small vase with a plant inside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3995" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi has done a fabulous job with the Mix Flip, which doesn't look and feel like a first-generation product at all. You get an aluminum frame and a dual-link hinge that can hold the device open at multiple angles for capturing photos. The smartphone is available in two colors (Black and Purple), but there's no ingress protection rating.</p><p>The 4.01-inch AMOLED cover display features a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and is protected by Xiaomi's Shield Glass. As for the inner folding screen, it's a 6.86-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also comes with a refresh rate of 120Hz and can achieve up to 3000 nits of peak brightness.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about the internals. Being the newer product, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is powered by Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, working in tandem with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Conversely, the Xiaomi Mix Flip features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC under the hood, along with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>Although the Razr Ultra 2025 does have a slight edge over the Mix Flip due to its better innards, both devices have hardware specifications comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there. Consequently, they can handle even the most resource-intensive of tasks with little to no effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi" name="xiaomi-mix-flip-40" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip half folded against a purple background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two foldables are matched pretty evenly in terms of connectivity and I/O, with both offering features like Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, multi-band 5G support, and NFC. However, since the Xiaomi Mix Flip isn't officially available in the United States (and many other regions around the world), the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is going to have better carrier compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-software-cameras-and-battery-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Software, cameras, and battery</h2>
<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 runs Android 15 out of the box, with Motorola's Hello UI overlay. Even though the software experience is still fairly minimal, there are several thoughtful additions that take it to the next level, with 'Moto AI' being the most notable of them. As the name suggests, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> is the company's own suite of AI-powered tools that work alongside Google's Gemini. These include Image Studio and Playlist Studio, which can be used to generate images and create contextual music playlists.</p><p>The cover screen functionality has also gotten a bit better. You can not only use apps natively on the cover display but also set up shortcuts for in-app functions, configure widgets, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-15" alt="Look & Talk on the Razr Ultra 2025 listening for a voice" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Running Android 14 with Xiaomi's HyperOS overlay, the Mix Flip comes with its own collection of AI-based features that are aimed at enhancing the overall user experience. Some of these tools include an AI Interpreter (for real-time translation of calls), AI Notes (for automatic formatting and summarization of notes), AI Film (for creating short cinematic videos). Of course, Google's AI features (e.g., Circle to Search) are also bundled. HyperOS comes with extensive customization options, including pet lock screens, dynamic widgets, and more.</p>
<p>While the Razr Ultra 2025 is set to receive three years of OS and four years of security updates, the Mix Flip will get four years of OS and five years of security updates. This update policy isn't really bad, but it doesn't match up to what you get with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> from companies like Samsung and Google.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to cameras, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a dual-lens primary camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP ultrawide unit. Thanks to Motorola's collaboration with Pantone, you can expect fabulous photos with good dynamic range and vibrant colors, even in dimly lit environments.</p><p>The Xiaomi Mi Flip features a dual-lens primary camera setup as well, with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP telephoto module with 2x optical zoom. While the lack of an ultrawide lens is a bit of a bummer, Xiaomi's association with Leica means that the photos are packed with detail and you have a lot of fun image styles to play with.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 features a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W fast charging support. As for the Mix Flip, it has a slightly bigger 4,780mAh battery with 67W wired charging support. While these specs are almost identical, the Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with wireless charging (30W) support, whereas the Mix Flip doesn't.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-which-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>There's no denying that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Mix Flip are among the best foldable phones out there. Both these devices not only represent the best that Motorola and Xiaomi have to offer, but also prove that foldable smartphones are here to stay. They come with a similar set of features, and at the same time, have their own share of pros and cons too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a starting price of $1,299, the Razr Ultra 2025 packs top-of-the-line hardware, a laundry list of AI-based tools, an all-day battery life, and incredible cameras. It's fairly expensive, but buying one is simple and network compatibility (with both mainstream and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a>) is almost guaranteed. On the other hand, the Mix Flip can be had for a starting price as low as $899, but you'll most likely have to import it. And even if you do, you'll have to do some research to ensure whether it'll work with your wireless carrier or not. Nonetheless, it's an amazing product that comes with a great design, thoughtful software additions, and versatile cameras. So, which one should you ultimately go for?</p>
<p>Here's what we recommend! If you simply need a flagship foldable that ticks almost all the right boxes and don't mind paying a premium for it, go ahead and get the Razr Ultra 2025. However, if you're willing to go the import route and know how to check for things such as carrier compatibility, you can go for the Mix Flip and save at least $400, if not more.</p>

However, rumors point to it being improved so it could have an IP58 or IP68 rating. This would make it the only foldable to achieve this level of dust-proofing, if Samsung manages this feat.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="getting-a-higher-ip-rating-continues-to-be-a-huge-challenge-with-foldables-2">Getting a higher IP rating continues to be a huge challenge with foldables</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the Z Flip 6 were the only two foldables for a while to sport an IP48 rating. This was a big achievement for foldables and Samsung led the charge on this. An IPX8 rating which guarantees protection against only liquids, was also something Samsung pioneered. The first number in the rating denotes protection against solid particles, and the higher it goes (up to 6) the better the device is able to stay protected against much smaller solid particles or dust.</p><p>An IP48 rating ensures the device can survive ingress of solid particles larger than 1mm, which technically isn't dust. For that, we need an IP58 or IP68 rating, which is the gold standard. Going by the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931">leaks and rumors</a> surrounding the Galaxy Z Fold 7, all we know is that it's expected to have "improved dust and water resistance." This technically means we should be expecting a higher IP rating, at least for the dust part of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sealing off a foldable from water and dust is immensely challenging since there's a massive hinge to contend with, which contains multiple moving parts and intricate mechanisms. Finding a way to block dust from entering the small gaps can be very tricky. We have no doubt Samsung has been working on a way to make its foldables properly IP68-rated one day, but whether that'll happen with the Z Fold 7 remains to be seen.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is going to be yet another expensive foldable but having a higher IP rating would certainly set it apart from the rest, and maybe even convince existing Z Fold users to upgrade. We don't know for sure how secure the Fold 7 will be against dust and water, but you can be certain that it will have an IP48 rating as the bare minimum, if not better.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><u><em>Ultimate Guide</em></u></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Those eagerly awaiting Motorola's newest smartwatch rejoice, as the company delivers on its promise.</p><p>Announced earlier this morning via a press release, Motorola states consumers can expect the Watch Fit this week on May 22. Those in the U.S. will find the device available on Trekking Green for $199 on Motorola.com with "subsequent availability" on Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>If you're in Canada, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">Moto Watch Fit</a> will be available on the same date; however, it will cost $249 CAD in Trekking Green.</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit is designed to keep active users active and ensure their sights never falter on their fitness goals. As the post reiterates, one of the watch's highlights is its 16-day battery life, meaning you won't have to stress for a while. During its launch last month, Motorola stated the Watch Fit will give users a 1.9-inch OLED protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display should remain bright, even while out during the day in sunlight.</p><p>Feature-wise, Motorola says the Watch Fit packs support for over 100 sports modes, as well as advanced heart rate tracking, and built-in GPS.</p><p>The Watch Fit's "deep" Android integration brings media controls, photo capture, and more, meaning you can do more from your wrist.</p>

<p>April was busy for Motorola as the company not only debuted the Watch Fit but also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. The Buds Loop is the brand's first open-ear buds that keep being stylish close to heart. Consumers will find a sleek design for the Buds Loop that complements its 12mm ironless drivers. This should enable the buds to deliver crisp, bold audio for music/video.</p><p>Like the Watch Fit, Motorola hopes those staying active, hitting the gym, will find comfort with the Buds Loop. In a single charge, these buds can run for up to eight hours. However, pair that with the charging case, and you can reach upwards of 37 hours.</p><p>The Buds Loop and Watch Fit debuted as accessories to Motorola's main dish: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">the Razr, Razr Plus, and Razr Ultra</a>. Instead of its expected pair of foldables, Moto stunned with three. The top-tier Razr Ultra contains a unique wood-finish with a 7-inch internal display and a 4-inch cover screen. Of course, there's tons of unique AI features users can utilize if they desire, ranging from Google's Gemini to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>.</p>

One of the latest features to be included with YouTube Premium is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">create AI-generated radio stations</a>. Using the Ask Music feature, you can provide a simple prompt to create a custom station based on your mood, interests, genre, or even a specific event, like a themed party or gathering. Once you get started, you can continue the conversation to further refine the playlist so it’s absolutely perfect.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-ai-generated-radio-stations-on-youtube-music-2">How to create AI-generated radio stations on YouTube Music</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube Music app</strong>.</p><p>2. On the Home screen, scroll down to the <strong>Ask for music</strong> section and enter your text command in the <strong>“Ask way you like” field</strong> or <strong>tap the microphone </strong>and speak what you want. Enter a prompt like “smooth jazz for a relaxing date night” or “upbeat tunes for a cardio workout.” In this example, we chose “UK Punjabi songs.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. The station should automatically start playing. Otherwise, you can tap the <strong>“Adjust or ask again”</strong> field or the microphone to add refinements to the radio. There are also suggestion bubbles you can choose from to get more of what you want, like, in this example, “More traditional Punjabi music,” “Similar artists from India,” or "latest Bollywood tracks."</p><p>4. Once you’re happy with the playlist, you can <strong>Shuffle play, Save to playlist, Delete radio</strong>, or <strong>Pin to Speed dial</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-do-ai-generated-radio-stations-work-2">How do AI-generated radio stations work?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how this magic happens. The feature uses the power of generative AI. It can take into account the types of music and artists you traditionally love to play and help you discover new music. It can also find music based on your specific command, like tunes of a specific genre, songs or artists from a specific country, or music with a tempo that fits an overall vibe.</p><p>Your prompts will help it further refine until you get exactly what you want. Once set up, your custom playlist can last the entire duration of a summer barbecue with friends, plus the afterparty later. Everyone will wonder where you found this epic station or how long it took you to create it (Shhh, no one needs to know!).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Note that, as mentioned, using this feature requires a subscription to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>, which is $14 per month. That subscription unlocks features in other apps, too, including YouTube, YouTube Kids, YouTube Gaming, and YouTube VR. There’s also the standalone YouTube Music Premium option, which is $11 per month after a one-month trial, and you can cancel at any time. It will give you access to more than 100 million songs, free from ads.</p><p>The ability to create AI-generated radio stations that use your interests or specific needs takes the guesswork out of playlist creation. This feature contributes to YouTube Music's being named among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">the best music streaming services</a>. With features like this, it’s certainly also one of the smartest.</p>

The tools allow users to pair multiple Bluetooth headphones to the same Pixel phone for content sharing, and make it possible to start or listen to a mass broadcast.</p><p>The Auracast and Bluetooth LE Audio feature is set to be a game-changer for both accessibility and content consumption. If you're interested in sharing your audio with multiple Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, you can do so now by following this guide. It'll only get easier when Android 16 officially releases, too.</p><p>If you're still catching up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">what the terms Auracast or LE Audio even mean</a>, let's dive in, because we'll cover that as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-audio-sharing-on-a-pixel-phone-2">What you need to use Audio sharing on a Pixel phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zc27Q9iAvirgKJ4xWemU5d" name="Android-16-5" alt="The Android 16 logo on a Google Pixel 8a outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc27Q9iAvirgKJ4xWemU5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bits of the Audio sharing feature have appeared across multiple Android beta programs, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. Currently, the Audio sharing settings page isn't visible in Android 16 Beta 4, but it can be enabled in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/all-about-your-phones-developer-options">Developer Options</a> on supported Pixel phones. You will need a Google Pixel 8 series or newer phone to access this feature, as it requires Auracast.</p><p>It appears that running the Android 16 beta is actually optional to activate Audio sharing, as the Developer Options toggle you need to find is available on Android 15 devices. If you are interested in becoming a tester, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">follow this guide to install the Android 16 beta on your Pixel phone</a>.</p><p>After that, you can follow these steps to make it appear:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>About phone</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap your <strong>build number</strong> multiple times in succession to enable Developer Options.</p><p>4. You'll see <strong>You are now a developer</strong> when you have done this successfully.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSkJjHFK5eBZTdsjoum2uF" name="Enable-Developer-Options-Pixel" alt="Enabling Developer Options on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSkJjHFK5eBZTdsjoum2uF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you've successfully activated Developer Options and can find the hidden toggle needed to reveal Audio sharing. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>System page</strong>, then press the <strong>Developer Options tab</strong>.</p><p>3. Find <strong>Enable Bluetooth LE Audio Broadcast UI preview</strong> in the list, and flip the toggle <strong>on</strong>.</p><p>4. Follow the on-screen prompts to <strong>restart your phone</strong> so that the changes take effect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="duRnQ87Y4W6VDnF5y5vKcm" name="Enable-Audio-Sharing-Dev-Op" alt="Enabling visibility for the Audio Sharing page in Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/duRnQ87Y4W6VDnF5y5vKcm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you'll be able to find the <strong>Audio sharing </strong>page in your <strong>Settings app</strong> on a supported Google Pixel phone. This is a fair bit of work to gain access to a feature, but that's because Audio sharing is still not publicly available yet.</p><p>All the steps in this section won't be required when Google officially rolls out Bluetooth LE and Auracast support via Audio sharing in a public release, but it's unclear when that will be. Since the feature isn't visible by default in the latest Android 16 Beta 4.1 release, it's not guaranteed that Audio sharing will be available on day one.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start-audio-sharing-2">How to start Audio sharing</h2>
<p>Audio sharing requires supported earbuds or headphones, as you won't be able to start it on a Pixel phone without at least one pair connected. Your audio devices need to support Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio to work with Audio sharing, and we have a rundown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">some supported earbuds and headphones here</a>. Not all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best Android earbuds</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a> support this feature, but many — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">3 Pro</a> — offer Bluetooth LE Audio.</p><p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><em> If you don't immediately see your supported headphones or earbuds show up as Audio sharing compatible, completely forgetting the device and re-pairing should do the trick. Check if there's a toggle for </em><em><strong>LE Audio</strong></em><em> in the device settings page for each set of compatible earbuds, too.</em></p><p>With all that in mind, when you have Audio sharing visible on a Pixel phone and supported earbuds ready, you can start sharing by following these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Connected devices page</strong>, then press <strong>Connection preferences</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Audio sharing page</strong>, which is now visible.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Audio sharing </strong>to start.</p><p>5. You'll now see a <strong>QR code</strong> appear for your broadcast alongside your device name and optional broadcast password — both of which are needed for others to connect to your broadcast.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Pair new device</strong> to add earbuds or headphones or <strong>Close </strong>to finish.</p><p>7. You can also join an existing broadcast by tapping <strong>Find an audio stream</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY" name="Android-16-Share-Audio" alt="Starting an audio share on Android 16 with a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After that, you've created a broadcast and have the option to pair multiple LE Audio-compatible headsets to your Pixel phone. With full Auracast support, this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">crucial for accessibility reasons</a> — public events, sporting contests and concerts, and transit hubs can send out Auracast-compatible broadcasts that anyone can listen to. It's also a handy tool in general, as you can share music or a movie with the person next to you or the entire room.</p>

<p>Audio sharing, with Bluetooth LE and Auracast, is confirmed to be heading to Pixel phones soon with the release of Android 16. Google touted the feature as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 Beta 3's release notes</a>, the same update that reached platform stability for the first time. At the moment, we don't know exactly <em>when</em> in Android 16's lifecycle the feature will release — it could be available on day one or arrive in a future Android 16 update.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to wait because Pixel phone users running both Android 15 and the Android 16 beta can use Audio sharing today. Whether you need hearing assistance or simply want to share your phone's audio with a friend, this handy Android 16 feature can help.</p>

Govee's latest product is the Gaming Pixel Light, and it is basically a pixel light grid that's highly customizable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GYgeyaFFBUVMPxJEyLeGFL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYgeyaFFBUVMPxJEyLeGFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Gaming Pixel Light is available in two sizes — a 32x32 grid that measures 5.3 x 5.3 inches, and a 52x32 grid that comes in at 8.5 x 5.3 inches — and Govee sent both models over. I prefer the 52x32 as it has a bigger canvas. Interestingly, both models get a 3W audio driver, and you can get alerts via the device itself. There's  a stand included in the package that lets you put the Gaming Pixel Light on your desk, and it is wall-mountable.</p>

<p>Govee showcased the product in January, and it went on sale starting May 19. The 32x32 variant of the Gaming Pixel Light (H6630) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Gaming-Real-time-Display-Options/dp/B0DZ6T9VCM">is on Amazon at $119</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Gaming-Real-time-Display-Options/dp/B0DZ6QJ5ZC">52x32 model (H6631) costs $139</a>. Both models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-gaming-pixel-light?variant=44661771960505">available on Govee's website</a> as well, and they cost the same as Amazon.</p>

<p>The idea behind the Gaming Pixel Light is that you can put it up on your desk and have it scroll through various scenes; it serves as an analog or digital clock, shows real-time weather (you'll need to enter the city name), and there's a nifty countdown timer as well. And if you're invested in all things blockchain, you even get the ability to view real-time Bitcoin pricing (it refreshes every five minutes).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rEqoqgVGhUbK3TsZBLPycL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rEqoqgVGhUbK3TsZBLPycL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the ability to use it as an analog clock, but as it doesn't show the seconds hand, I switched to weather mode instead, and it was quite nifty. What's particularly great is that you can use the pixel grid to show various scenes; there are over 150 scenes programmed in the Govee app, and you get a vast selection of choices. The best part about using Govee products is that they can be integrated into Home Assistant, and it is a big reason why I prefer using the brand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2roocSkEP6GR42kLUYN4gL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2roocSkEP6GR42kLUYN4gL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pixelated grid is decidedly retro, but the LED colors are uniform, and you can adjust the brightness of the panel. There's a music mode as well that changes the patterns dynamically based on music playing in the vicinity (it has a built-in mic), and my favorite feature is the ability to use your own images or videos on the panel.</p>

<p>Like everything else these days, you get an AI-assisted feature that lets you create new scenes by talking to the Govee AI assistant. I asked it to create a Pac-Man scene, and it did a semi-decent job. To round out the features, you get a finger drawing mode that lets you sketch out a pattern to use on the panel.</p>

<p>The design itself ties in with a gamer-focused aesthetic, with the black design intersected by jagged edges and green etched lines. The speaker is housed at the back, and you have controls up top to switch the panel on or off, adjust volume, and change scenes.</p>

<p>The only limitation with the Gaming Pixel Light is that it needs to be plugged in — there's no built-in battery. That obviously curbs its usability as you'll need to house it in a location with easy access to a wall plug, and I would've liked a truly portable unit with a battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zLW4vzkJwbPgr6PJHKLjXL" name="Govee Gaming Pixel Light" alt="Govee Gaming Pixel Light review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLW4vzkJwbPgr6PJHKLjXL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, the Gaming Pixel Light is faultless. If you grew up playing 8-bit games and want a pixel grid that's highly customizable, this is the one to get. Govee did a fantastic job with the panel, but it's the customizability where the Gaming Pixel Light truly shines. If you're eyeing this product, I'd suggest getting the 52x32 model.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is all set to announce its new in-house-developed silicon chipset dubbed XRing 01. New information and a couple of leaked benchmark tests reveal what the upcoming chipset will have to offer.</p><p>The XRing 01 is believed to be exclusive to the China region for now, and it will be unveiled on May 22 through a product launch event. The teased posters on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/2202387347">Weibo</a> also indicate that it is an advanced 3nm-based silicon (2nd gen), and leaked benchmarks indicate that it is likely a strong contender to Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that powers most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phones</a> this year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking) Xiaomi Xring O1 Geekbench pic.twitter.com/tXEQE65wXD<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1923978900004274653">May 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/xiaomis-in-house-xring-01-soc-leaked-melds-10-core-arm-cortex-cpu-plus-16-core-mali-g925-gpu">Tom’s Hardware</a>), the XRing 01 has been spotted on Geekbench tests, and the chipset scored a notable 2709 single-core score and 8125 multi-core score. On the other hand, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1924310555445416426/photo/1">tipster Ice Universe</a> has also shared another Geekbench test of the same chipset that revealed even better 3017 single-core and 9264 multi-core readings, which sounds promising for a new unreleased SoC.</p><p>The benchmark also implies that the XRing 01 is being run on an Android 15-based phone, likely the Xiaomi 15S Pro, which is also believed to be announced at the same event alongside the Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi XRing O1 pic.twitter.com/KUZ4zeJQaA<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1924244770563785102">May 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the Geekbench test also reveals the unique deca-core setup featuring two cores with 1.80GHz clock speeds, another two with 1.89GHz, four 3.40GHz speed cores, and two other cores with 3.90GHz.</p><p>The latter are expected to be the two Cortex-X925 cores, and the four are believed to be Cortex A725/X4 cores. The cores with 1.89GHz are likely the Cortex A720/A725 ones, and the first two are expected to be the Cortex A520 cores.</p><p>With the expected configuration and benchmark tests, the chipset alongside the Snapdragon 8 Elite is likely to take on Dimensity 9400 and Exynos 2400 SoCs as well. The chipset ahead of the release already sounds promising, which is understandable since the company has invested four years in research and development in making the SoC. It also makes Xiaomi join the list with its counterparts like Huawei, Apple, and Google, who all already develop their in-house chipsets for their flagships.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is launching the compact yet powerful OnePlus 13s in India on June 5, featuring a 6.32-inch display and Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>The OnePlus 13s also will also introduce the new Plus Key, replacing the famous Alert Slider with expanded customizable functionalities.</li><li>Promising best-in-class battery life for a compact phone, the OnePlus 13s may feature a similar large battery and Glacier technology as seen in the China-exclusive OnePlus 13T.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>2025 is turning out to be an interesting year for smartphones as we are getting to see more diverse models than the conventional flagships. While we recently got to see a slim phone from Samsung, OnePlus is set to debut its compact phone.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus 13s, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact handset</a> is making its way to the Indian market on June 5, and the teasers indicate that it is coming in at least three colors: black, pink, and a military green hue. The device also makes a notable departure from the conventional circular camera visor and instead opts for a squarish design that features two sensors.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new icon debuts. Save the date. #OnePlus13s pic.twitter.com/Hdgx6Afhf4<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1924352478390403208">May 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Needless to say, the upcoming OnePlus 13s is pretty similar to what the company has announced in China last month, which is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T</a>. Like the latter, the OnePlus 13s is also confirmed to have a 6.32-inch display and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/13s">OnePlus website listing</a>.</p><p>The other confirmed features of the OnePlus 13s include an all-new Plus Key, which replaces the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">famous Alert Slider</a>. While the slider offered minimal functionality, like changing the sound profiles, the Plus Key promises to offer several other functionalities, like setting it for sound profiles, enabling Do Not Disturb mode, invoking the camera, flashlight, to translate what’s on screen, and several others, which can also be AI-powered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e" name="OnePlus-13s-teaser-image" alt="OnePlus 13s tease for India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13s will also be 5.5G ready and also have an independent G1 Wi-Fi chipset and further promises to offer the best battery life on a compact phone. The OnePlus 13T in China notably featured a larger 6260mAh battery, a tad bit higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R, which had 6000mAh batteries each. And, the latter two are significantly bigger in size than the OnePlus 13T’s compact offering. So, we expect a similar approach on the OnePlus 13s as well, including the incorporation of the company’s Glacier battery technology.</p><p>It is finally good to see the OnePlus 13s finally having a launch date after a host of teasers from the company that were shared on social media, and also on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/b?_encoding=UTF8&ie=UTF8&node=206845240031&store_ref=SB_A0221685GDPRJL3VQSBS-A06744412OMDOB09ESPP0&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aaxitk=ab41b09131f3ab6de73dfc7db206c1e3&hsa_cr_id=0&lp_query=oneplus+13s&lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&pd_rd_w=ePE30&content-id=amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f:amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_p=5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_r=AM3FJ89TXFNSSS4PXNXB&pd_rd_wg=8SFde&pd_rd_r=be384195-b096-4101-b91e-706a6f498047&linkCode=sl2&tag=prsocial-21&linkId=fd1f401f3512d91f0cdec15cd78b3fca&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon India listing</a>. Starting with the Indian market, the compact phone from the company is hopefully expected to make its way to other regions in the near future.</p>

Everything you need to make it work, including a USB-C to USB-C cable and USB-A adapter, is included in the box.</p><p>The sound quality is exemplary, thanks in part to some proprietary parts made by Questyle, but there are some things you need to know as you consider the purchase, so let’s get into all of that!</p>

<p>A lot is going on inside the M18i. Internally, the DAC uses dual ESS ES9219Q DACs and other hardware powered by a 16-core XMOS XU316 processor. You also get a Qualcomm chipset that includes its latest clear voice communications chipset and Infineon MEMS microphones. We’ll talk about those components more in a moment. There are a few other things inside the DAC, but I’ll go over those as I talk about audio quality. Check the spec table for other odds and technical ends you may be curious about.</p><p>The build quality is very reassuring. The unit is small, and all components are wrapped in a CNC anodized aluminum alloy. There’s a tempered glass screen on the front of the device with an OLED display. The information you’ll get from the top row of that screen is: volume, gain level (<strong>L</strong>ow or <strong>H</strong>igh), earbuds/headphone connected indicator, and battery charge indicator. Below that, you’ll see your sample rate in a larger font, and below that, the mode and decoding indicators.</p>

<p>Holding the device vertically with the screen facing you, the top is where you’ll find the 3.5mm (SE) and 4.4mm (Balanced) outputs. The right side is where you’ll find the delightfully clicky function buttons. You get a power button that will also dim the screen, separate volume up and down buttons, an MFB or multifunction button that controls gain and Bluetooth functions, and a mode sliding switch that is stiff and doesn’t feel like it will get loose anytime soon.</p><p>You’ll find one of two USB-C ports at the bottom of the unit. This one is primarily for data transfer, but in PC mode, the unit does charge from the source it’s connected to. The second USB-C port is on the left side and doesn’t support data. Charging only.</p>

<p>Overall, the M18i is one of the more transparent, nuanced mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android" target="_blank">DACs I’ve had the pleasure of testing</a>. Let’s talk about using it to drive the equally transparent, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">analytical Sennheiser IE900s</a>: This pairing is <em>not</em> for bass lovers, though tracks mastered with a heavy-handed low end sound superb with regard to their low-end nuance and resolve. Using the IE900s with the gain set to low and the 4.4mm Balanced connection, I could drive them beautifully with the volume only halfway up at 30 of 60 steps.</p><p>What is the “flavor profile” of this pairing? Very transparent. No color. An enjoyably large soundstage for IEMs, but the most compelling sonic feature is the nuance. Playing the DSF file of Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” there are backing vocals mixed to almost a whisper, you can clearly discern during the song’s intro at 15 seconds in. A feature of that mix that gets lost in less transparent sound reproduction with more colored DACs and earbuds/headphones.</p><p>Regarding tracks mastered with bass emphasis, The Roots’ “Do You Want More??!!!?” sounds exactly like it should, with no coloring of the boom bap heavy bass. The bass is still quite satisfying with this pairing. A PCM file of Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man” exposes an awesome orchestral arrangement! All the nuance, layered electric and analog pianos, saxophones, and cymbals. It’s an engrossing sonic experience with the M18i. In terms of signal-to-noise, the M18i is very dark!</p><p>There is no audible noise during the quiet parts of the intro to Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk" name="questyle-m18i-dac-sample-rate.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing PCM file sample rate and Low gain in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My sound test, pairing the M18i with Campfire Audio’s Mammoth IEMs via the 3.5mm connection, brought more weight and drama to the music with its more entertaining, punchier sound reproduction in the low end and sub-bass. There was some nuance lost in the low end with the IE900 that was realized with the Mammoth IEMs. This is the bass lovers' pairing.</p><p>Sennheiser HD660S2 was the first pairing that benefited from the high gain option, even with more juice flowing through the 4.4mm cables. I had to increase volume by nine steps, to 39. Over-ears allow the M18i to “stretch its legs” and expand that soundstage, giving it greater depth and layers as I listened to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST.</p><p>The detail in the attack and decay of the violins in Violin Duel was top tier! Next up, Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s ethereal a cappella on Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” was equally enjoyable, being so immersive thanks to the rich timbre and clarity provided in part by Questyle’s patented current-mode amplifier SiP technology found in all of their DACs.</p><p>In Bluetooth mode, the sound quality is still delightful. That said, there is a difference between the wired and Bluetooth 5.4 presentations. Still, thanks to the broad support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">Qualcomm aptX and LDAC HiRes Wireless Audio codecs</a>, that difference is minimal and likely indistinguishable to those new to active listening.</p>

<p>Continuing with the Bluetooth implementation, the Qualcomm chipset gave me better mic audio than expected. Frankly, this Infineon MEMS mic setup in the M18i sounds better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> I've reviewed, up there with Jabra, Beats, and AirPods Pro. It doesn't 100% eliminate background noise, but it gives you a healthy balance of background noise dampening with crystal clear voice pickup, so you don't sound like you're in a closet, as some TWS earbuds do.</p><p>Overall, from mobile to PC, the M18i presents an impressive sonic image. It’s balanced and transparent, with beautifully layered instrumentation separation. It also has the versatility to go anywhere and connect to almost anything, including Linux and HarmonyOS.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj" name="questyle-m18i-dac-charging-port.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing the dedicated USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life will be a pain point. One hour of wired hi-res file playback drained the battery from 97% to 41%. My results in battery testing were pretty consistent across modes, except for PC mode. That means the max you can expect out of the M18i is roughly two hours of playback.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a feature that mitigates the disappointing battery life of the internal 500mAh cell. Switching to PC mode will power the DAC from whatever device it’s plugged into. I tested that with my Google Pixel 9, and the phone’s battery drained at a rate of approximately 10% per hour. I tested with the phone in airplane mode because I wanted to see what the pull looked like without additional factors draining the battery, like weak cellular signal strength.</p><p>The side USB-C port also helps mitigate the short battery life. It supports charging <em>during</em> playback, so you can have a battery bank with you on that long-haul airplane ride to keep the tunes going as you cross the Atlantic or Pacific.</p>

<p>I’ve had the pleasure of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android" target="_blank">testing some wonderfully entertaining audiophile-grade mobile DACs</a> from iFi, Quedelix, and Fiio, and this is now one of my favorites. The sound quality is one of the best on the market, with the utility to ensure you get the most bang for your hard-earned buck.</p><p>Its MSRP is $400, but it’s currently on sale direct from Questyle’s website for $350. At the time of writing, it's also on Amazon with a $50 coupon, bringing the price down to $300. If you already have a good pair of IEMs or wired headphones, consider the M18i as you read reviews of competing products.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-samsung-being-so-stingy-with-charging-speeds-on-the-fold-7-2">Why is Samsung being so stingy with charging speeds on the Fold 7?</h2>
<p>Samsung's 2025 A series phones are looking more exciting by the day than its upcoming foldable, which does not bode well for a phone that'll cost north of $1,500. We've gotten quite a few details about Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and it's expected to be the company's slimmest foldable yet.</p><p>A leak from prolific tipster Ice Universe claims that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will use the same 4,400mAh battery capacity as the Z Fold 6. This is not terrible news when you consider the phone is expected to be a lot thinner, so keeping the same capacity while being thinner is commendable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly, what's also going to be the same is the charging speed. In early February, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-to-carry-z-fold-edition-features">tipped</a> that the Z Fold 7 would be nothing more than an upscaled Z Fold 6 Special Edition, and this recent filing on China's 3C regulatory website, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-charging-speed-3536509/">reported</a> by Android Authority, almost confirms this rumor about the charging speed being unchanged at 25W.</p><p>It is a real shame that a $1,500+ smartphone would have just 25W fast charging when Samsung's own $300 A series phone gets 45W charging. While not everyone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">obsessed with having the fastest charging</a>, it doesn't hurt to be able to charge your phone quicker if you can.</p><p>Samsung has been very stubborn with charging speeds, even for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best flagship</a> S series phones, reserving the faster 45W charging only for batteries larger than 4,500mAh. And since the Galaxy Z Fold 7 won't be getting a larger battery capacity, it's most likely stuck with the measly 25W charging.</p><p>While this is still speculation at this point since the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't officially out yet, all the credible rumors point to the fact that it will most likely have 25W fast charging, and not the 45W we were all hoping for.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Much like phones, smartwatches became sophisticated over the past decade, limiting the need for annual updates. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 wasn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-6">that much different from the Galaxy Watch 6</a>, for instance. If you needed any evidence of that, Samsung's two-year release cadence for Classic and Ultra models is a good indicator. But with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> on the horizon, is it finally time for Galaxy Watch 6 owners to consider an upgrade?</p><p>The answer might just be yes. While the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 likely won't be official for another few months, there's reason to believe it'll offer features that build on Watch 7 improvements. We have leaks and rumors predicting a design change, new health sensors, and other fitness features.</p><p>Want an early look at how the Galaxy Watch 8 might compare to the Galaxy Watch 6? Here's the speculative breakdown.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="epMw6fX5kQaJBUuk4svWca" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-and-6-Classic-on-desk.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epMw6fX5kQaJBUuk4svWca.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 side-by-side/ </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> launch date is far from official, but leakers have tipped that the company will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City sometime in mid-July. That tracks with past Galaxy Watch launches, as the last two generations launched on July 10 and July 26 in 2024 and 2023, respectively. That means the launch is only months away, and leaks should intensify as that date gets closer.</p><p>The big uncertainty is whether Samsung will raise prices this year, as the ongoing U.S. tariff situation ensures price hikes are always a possibility. However, we haven't seen any leaks regarding price increases for the Galaxy Watch 8 series yet. If pricing remains the same, the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 could start at $299, and the 44mm Galaxy Watch 8 could start at $329.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 launched at those exact same prices roughly two years ago, but has since come down in price. You can pick up a Galaxy Watch 6 for around $150 to $180 in new condition at major retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. Color options include Graphite, Silver (44mm only), and Gold (40mm only).</p>

<p>Samsung is already making bold claims about the Galaxy Watch 8's design, even before it is publicly announced. The company's corporate VP of MX Division, Daniel Araujo, previewed the upcoming smartwatch by saying it'll feature an "innovative design" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-q1-device-earnings-soar-its-chip-sales-take-a-hit" target="_blank">in a Q1 2025 earnings call</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Araujo said Samsung plans to "launch a new Galaxy Watch with an innovative design and enhanced health-related features." It's all part of an effort to grow Galaxy wearables "with a strengthened premium experience while expanding our lineup across all price segments."</p><p>It's unclear what exactly Samsung is referring to by an "innovative design," because there are only so many ways to design a smartwatch. Likely, the Galaxy Watch 8 will take a few design cues from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. There have been reported internal talks at Samsung about a squircle smartwatch design, and a squircle chassis with a circular display — like the Ultra — could be a way for the company to achieve this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.99%;"><img id="rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-graphics" alt="A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This seems to be the path Samsung plans to take with the Galaxy Watch 8, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">set of leaked images</a> reveal a similar look in device mockups. It's also another indicator that the company indeed plans to launch a Watch 8 Classic variant for the first time in a generation. Otherwise, current rumors indicate Samsung will retain the same general form factor, with 40mm and 44mm variants, for the Watch 8.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ng7EwTzTP7RFHNdYehnDVE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-watchface-detailed.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ng7EwTzTP7RFHNdYehnDVE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does that compare to the current Galaxy Watch 6? If the rumored design changes actually happen, the Watch 6 will have a completely different look due to its circular chassis. This could be a pro or a con, depending on your style preferences. The screen sizes will likely be the same between models, even if the Watch 8 has a larger case size as a result of its squircle housing.</p><p>If Samsung doesn't change the display itself on the Galaxy Watch 8, both models will sport the same Super AMOLED panels with matching resolutions. The Galaxy Watch 7 was offered in 1.3-inch, 432x432, and 1.5-inch, 480x480 display options, just like the Watch 6 that came before it. Both watches are also expected to offer IP68 water and dust-resistance certifications while meeting military durability standards.</p>

<p>The big difference between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 6, in terms of hardware, will be their health sensors. The former will likely include Samsung's latest optical bio-signal sensor, while the latter has a last-generation BioActive sensor. Samsung introduced a newer sensor with the Galaxy Watch 7, but could tap further into it with new features on the Watch 8.</p><p>One thing that isn't likely to change much is the battery life. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has a 40-hour battery life estimate, and the Galaxy Watch 8 should come with the exact same promise. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence" target="_blank">This is according to a leak</a> that revealed the Galaxy Watch 8's battery specs in regulatory filings.</p>

<p>Per the documents above, the bigger Galaxy Watch 8 will get a 10mAh size increase, raising the total capacity to 435mAh. However, the 40mm model won't get any additional capacity, which strongly suggests there will be no battery life improvements for the Galaxy Watch 8 this year.</p>

<p>Samsung is widely expected to launch the Galaxy Watch 8 with Wear OS 6, which has already been teased ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2025">Google I/O 2025</a> and shown off during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show</a> (at least the stock Pixel version). Meanwhile, the Galaxy Watch 6 launched with Wear OS 4 but has since received the upgrade to Wear OS 5. Among the improvements in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">10% battery life increase for some models</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Galaxy Watch 6 still has roughly two years of software support left, so it should eventually get the boost to Wear OS 6.</p><p>Separately, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-gemini-galaxy-watch-buds-integration-announcement">confirmed</a> that Galaxy Watch models will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> support, replacing Google Assistant. This change will hit Galaxy Watch hardware "in the coming months," potentially lining up with the Galaxy Unpacked event where the Galaxy Watch 8 should debut.</p>

<p>Gemini on Galaxy Watch will offer "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands," per the company. It can help with reminders, summaries, and notifications. If prior Samsung launches are any indication, Samsung could launch the Galaxy Watch 8 with extra Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, with basic functionality trickling down to devices like the Galaxy Watch 6.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 could be a worthy upgrade over the Galaxy Watch 6, but only for the right kind of person. If you use your Galaxy Watch for basic smartwatch features — like media controls, messaging, and notifications — there's no reason to toss aside your Galaxy Watch 6. It's running the latest One UI 6 Watch version and will get the boost to Wear OS 6 eventually. In other words, there's a lot of life left in it.</p><p>If you're the kind of smartwatch user who craves accurate and advanced health and fitness metrics, the Galaxy Watch 8 becomes a much more enticing option. Samsung introduced a new BioActive sensor with last year's Watch 7 that addresses many of the accuracy problems we had with the Watch 6, and those improvements will likely compound with the Watch 8. If we're lucky, we may even get brand new Watch 8 health capabilities.</p><p>Either way, we won't know for sure whether the Galaxy Watch 8 is a clear victor over the Galaxy Watch 6 until the former is officially announced. The good news is that we won't have to wait much longer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Oriveti is a Hong Kong-based audio manufacturer that's doing all the right things in the budget audio segment. I just looked at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/orivetis-blackbird-are-entry-level-iems-that-soar-high">entry-level Blackbird IEMs</a>, and the brand somehow managed to create a set with plenty of bass and a vibrant sound — something that usually isn't the case with entry-level products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QugSs2zZeeCf6Z2KtPSMdY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QugSs2zZeeCf6Z2KtPSMdY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sitting in the tier above is the OD200; I've had these IEMs for over four months now, and they've held up well. The OD200 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oriveti.com/product-page/oriveti-od200-single-dynamic-driver-hifi-iem">available on the brand's website for $199</a>, and over in India (where I got my unit), the brand teamed up with local retailer Headphone Zone and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/headphone-zone-x-oriveti-od200">selling the product at ₹9,999</a> ($118). After launching last year, it has consistently been among the best-selling budget IEMs on the site, and that alone is indicative of its potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="STVNHoa6b8RBizWEujyvkY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STVNHoa6b8RBizWEujyvkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let's start with the design. The OD200 has possibly the best build quality of any budget IEMs; it has an all-metal chassis with an anodized finish, and the contoured design ensures you get a great fit. I thought the IEMs would be on the heavier side, but that isn't the case — I didn't see any issues with comfort even with extended use.</p>

<p>What I like is that you can significantly alter the sound by switching out the nozzles — there are two available in the package. Another interesting addition is the unique airflow, with Oriveti using a custom system that ensures better airflow to the acoustic chamber, leading to much better sound quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jiFQgRNjThbiqQE9ZX3hiY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiFQgRNjThbiqQE9ZX3hiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll also note that Oriveti is particularly generous with the accessories it bundled with the OD200; you get a massive package that includes 13 sets of ear tips — much more than what's normally provided in this category — and a high-quality cable and hard-shell carrying case.</p>
<p>Continuing with the positives, the OD200 comes with an interchangeable cable, with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm plugs bundled as standard. Again, this is something that you just don't see in the budget segment, and the attention to detail that Oriveti lavished on the design and accessories is unmatched.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="827iFokj352WjKGsVbmgjY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/827iFokj352WjKGsVbmgjY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the OD200 predominantly with the silver nozzle, and it produces a distinctive sound that's highly engaging. I paired the monitors with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">Fiio's M15S player</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>, and I recommend using a DAC that has decent power.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TGmZywEWvg9iPVXKyNdSiY" name="Oriveti OD200" alt="Oriveti OD200 IEMs review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TGmZywEWvg9iPVXKyNdSiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the Blackbird, the OD200 shines with the low-end, delivering a wonderfully rich and detailed bass with vigor. The bass is very engaging, and it's easy to see why these IEMs sell so well — they're ideally suited to listen to modern music. The mid-range is clean, and you get good instrument separation along with vocal clarity. If anything, I think the mid-range detail is where the OD200 comes into its own; it is wonderful in this area.</p>

<p>There's good treble extension as well, but it isn't fatiguing in the least, and you don't notice any sibilance. Overall, there really isn't anything to criticize with the OD200; the IEMs have a robust design that's built to last, and they include an extensive range of accessories. But where they stand out is the sound quality — these may just be one of the best-sounding IEMs I've used, and they're now my go-to recommendation in this category.</p>

While this isn't great for a new model, I get why Motorola did this as the 2024 model was pretty feature-packed to begin with. The new additions include an IP48 rating, a sturdier hinge, and Pantone-validated cameras for better color accuracy.</p></p>

While it made a good alternative to the Samsung Z Flip 4 at $999, you can now find the phone for about $499 online, making it a great bargain for a flagship flip phone. You'll still have to live a few compromises though, most of which are addressed by the 2025 model.</p></p>

<p>Motorola really hit the ground running when it reimagined the Razr line in 2023 with the standard phone and the Plus model. The Razr Plus 2023 is still being sold online for nearly half of the $999 price tag it launched for back in 2023. This certainly makes it tempting for anyone wanting a brand-new flip smartphone but is put off by the outlandish prices.</p><p>We really enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a> when we reviewed it, despite its many shortcomings. But Motorola has iterated fast and hard since then, making the 2024 model even better, while the new 2025 Razr Plus adds more refinements to an already great phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> is not longer the hero product, that spot has been taking up by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The Razr Plus 2025 still costs $999 and features some big improvements over the 2023 model. It also costs twice as much though. If you're looking at a Motorola Razr Plus 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023 comparison, should you spring for the latest one or save a lot and pick the older model?</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4162px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKqyUEQvAG4dBBd6W6EPeG" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Razr-Plus-2023-2.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 next to the Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKqyUEQvAG4dBBd6W6EPeG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4162" height="2341" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2025 Razr Plus and the 2023 model look quite similar at first glance. Both have roughly the same thickness of about 7mm when unfolded and around 15.1mm when closed. The new model is actually a bit heavier at 189 grams, compared to 184 grams of the 2023 model. The older Razr has broader metal strips on the back where the two halves meet when unfolded, compared to much slimmer ones on the 2025 model.</p><p>A quick way to differentiate the two is by the colors. The 2023 Razr Plus comes in Infinite Black, Glacier Blue, Viva Magenta, Peach Fuzz, while the 2025 model comes in Pantone colors of Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink.</p><p>What's not immediately visible is the ingress protection. The 2023 Razr Plus only had a splash-resistant coating but the 2025 Razr Plus has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">proper IP48 rating for dust and water resistance</a>. This puts it on par with the more expensive Galaxy Z Flip 6 (and in all likelihood, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Z Flip 7</a> too). This is a big upgrade that Motorola has given to the new Razr and one many buyers will be paying attention to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ksrB6o9ftdZz33THZgwSDN" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-2" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ksrB6o9ftdZz33THZgwSDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other big change in the 2025 Razr Plus is to the outer display. It features a 4-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,400 nits. The 2023 Razr Plus had a 3.6-inch display with a slightly lower resolution, a 144Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,100 nits. The outer displays of both models are still way ahead of what Samsung offers.</p><p>The size of the main folding display of both phones has stayed the same at 6.9 inches. The resolutions and refresh rates are the same, too, but the brightness in the 2025 Razr Plus is 3,000 nits, compared to 1,400 nits in the 2023 model. This spec alone should make using the folding screen under direct sunlight infinitely better, as we had some trouble clearly viewing the Razr Plus 2023's display in sunlight.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 might not be that different from the 2024 model, but it has some big upgrades compared to the 2023 model. Firstly, it ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, so you're already on the latest software version when you buy it. I would have liked a longer update commitment from Motorola by now, but it's still three years of OS upgrades only.</p><p>The next notable change is the core hardware. The 2025 Moto Razr Plus features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> SoC from the 2024 model, which is a mildly cut-down version of the 8 Gen 3. You do get 12GB of RAM, versus 8GB on the 2023 model.</p><p>Cameras are a big upgrade on the 2025 model, with a 50MP main and 50MP telephoto, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">we would have preferred an ultrawide here</a>. The resolution jump should produce much sharper images and better low-light photos, as this is one area where the 2023 Razr Plus fell short.</p><p>Finally, the battery is a lot bigger and charging is faster too, both wired and wireless. We weren't impressed with the 2023 Razr Plus' battery life, so this 2025 model should provide a good boost.</p>

<p>Motorola has already rolled out the Android 15 update for the 2023 Razr Plus, so you can start enjoying all the new features right away. It should also get Android 16 later in the year, but anything beyond that is questionable. We revisited the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">2revisited the 3023 Razr Plus</a> after using it nearly daily for a year, and we're happy to note that the phone held up fairly well despite its delayed Android 14 update. Performance is still smooth, apps and games run well, and unfortunately, what was bad is still the same.</p><p>The 2025 Razr Plus ships with Android 15 and comes with some new features that are currently exclusive to the 2025 series. These include Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This, among other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI features</a>. We found Group Shot to be an interesting new camera feature for taking group photos. Many of these features should make it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr Plus</a> model since they share the same processor, but we might not see them on the 2023 model.</p>

<p>If you have the budget or were looking for an upgrade from the 2023 Razr Plus, the new 2025 model offers just the right upgrades to keep you happy, while still being familiar. Technically, you could get the 2024 Razr Plus, too, if you find it on sale for $200 (or more) lower than the 2025 model; otherwise, you might as well get the latest one if the price difference isn't much.</p><p>I'd choose the 2025 model over the 2023 model purely because of better battery life, cameras, and the IP48 rating. Plus, it doesn't hurt to have longer software support and useful AI features.</p><p>Having said that, our Managing Editor Derrek Lee's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">long-term verdict</a> on the 2023 Razr Plus is that if you can live with the compromises of the weak battery life and average cameras, it's hard to beat at its current discounted price. As of writing this article, the 2023 Razr Plus is on sale on Amazon for just $500, making it an insanely good value.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is likely still a few months away, but there's already a lot to look forward to about the device. We have talked about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> possibly being the first smartwatch to run Wear OS 6, adding new health features, and bringing an "innovative" design. But the thing everyone wants to know is how the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 will stack up against the existing Google Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 and the current Galaxy Watch 7 already have key differences, as the former offers style and simplicity while the latter provides a more advanced feature set. That should continue with the next Galaxy Watch 8, based on Samsung's public teasers about the device. Let's dive into how these two Wear OS smartwatches might compare based on current rumors, leaks, and speculation.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Rumors indicate that Samsung will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City sometime in mid-July, and this is likely when we'll see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> for the first time. For reference, the last two Galaxy Watch models were released on July 10 and July 26 in 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>If pricing holds from the Galaxy Watch 7 series, we're looking at $299 for the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 and $329 for the 44mm Galaxy Watch 8. There aren't any rumors pointing to price hikes at the moment, but with the ongoing uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs, there's always a good chance costs could increase when new products are announced.</p><p>Luckily, we do know exactly how much the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> costs, as it has been out for more than half a year. Here's the full pricing breakdown:</p>

<p>All told, Google's smartwatches are typically higher-priced than Samsung Galaxy watches, especially when factoring in upgrades like larger screens or LTE support.</p>

<p>There haven't been many Galaxy Watch 8 leaks to date that reveal Samsung's design plans, but we may not need to speculate much. In the company's Q1 2025 earnings call, Corporate VP of MX Division Daniel Araujo teased its upcoming smartwatch, which will have a new design.</p><p>Samsung plans to grow its wearable market "with a strengthened premium experience while expanding our lineup across all price segments," Araujo said. "We plan to launch a new Galaxy Watch with an innovative design and enhanced health-related features."</p><p>As for what that "innovative design" might be, there have been reported rumblings internally at Samsung about switching to a squircle wearable design, like the 2014 Samsung Gear S. However, it seems unlikely this is the path Samsung will take with the Galaxy Watch 8, as Apple seems to have claimed the squircle form factor with the abundantly successful Apple Watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d4YctZJs5WUyJHBJq7YKrG" name="Samsung-Gear-S-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Gear S display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4YctZJs5WUyJHBJq7YKrG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, we could be looking at a hybrid of sorts, with a squircle chassis and a circular inset screen. This would mimic the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, bringing it down to the standard models. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">set of leaked images</a>, shown below, gives us a glimpse of what that might look like.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.99%;"><img id="rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-graphics" alt="A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rA8x92xSnWTA8k4dJkeC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A set of leaked graphics of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 and 8 Classic with a "squircle" design and a "Quick" button on the latter. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is offered in 40mm and 44mm case sizes, and we expect these to remain similar on the Galaxy Watch 8. The wild card here is the smartwatch's new design, because a different shape or display aspect ratio could tweak the watch's case size or screen size. As for durability, we can expect an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating and MIL-STD-810H certification for shock protection.</p><p>Compared to the Pixel Watch 3's "waterdrop" design, any iteration of Galaxy Watch 8 design is going to look different. The Pixel Watch 3 has a circular design with black bezels that help the display blend into the frame, and is offered in 41mm and 45mm sizes. It has a recycled aluminum case that can be configured in matte or polished finishes.</p>

<p>There's a crown on the right side of the watch that is used for navigation, providing haptic feedback as you scroll. You also get another button for controls and power options.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 has slimmer display bezels, a higher 60Hz refresh rate, and a brighter 2,000 nits of peak brightness. However, those figures simply help the Pixel Watch 3 catch up to the Galaxy Watch 7. That's why the Galaxy Watch 8 will likely continue this trend, and unless you like the Pixel Watch 3's minimalist design, the Samsung offering feels superior.</p>

<p>Due to regulatory filings, we have a better idea of the Galaxy Watch 8's hardware than its design. There will likely be a standard Galaxy Watch 8 and a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic available, with minor or no battery capacity increases.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">Per a leak</a>, the larger Galaxy Watch 8 will receive a 10mAh capacity bump, bringing the total capacity to 435mAh. Meanwhile, the 40mm variant will see no change in capacity, suggesting both models will retain their 40-hour battery estimate.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel Watch 3 has a more limited 24-hour battery life estimate. For what it's worth, Android Central's testers found that the Pixel Watch 3 often outperformed that figure. Battery life is likely to be worse compared to the Galaxy Watch 8 in either case.</p>

<p>While Samsung has given the Galaxy Watch a new processor for the last two generations, it's unclear if that trend will continue. No leaks point to a new chip, but it's always possible. For now, we know that the Galaxy Watch 8 may at least have the Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage — matching the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is equipped with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oppo-watch-3-official-qualcomm-next-gen-snapdragon-wear-platform">Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 5100 chip</a> and a Cortex-M33 co-processor, plus 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Both the Pixel Watch 3 and the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 should be more than capable of handling all your smartwatch needs.</p><p>The following is a specs table comparing expected, rumored, or assumed Galaxy Watch 8 specs to the Pixel Watch 3, but it should be noted that hardware leaks have been extremely limited so far. We'll have to wait until the Galaxy Watch 8 is closer to an official release before we have a definitive idea of what hardware it will offer.</p>

<p>Software and health sensing is where the Galaxy Watch 8 may pull away from the Pixel Watch 3. Our testers found that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> can handle basic activity tracking and running workouts, other workout metrics are less reliable. Plus, there have been inconsistent experiences with GPS data on the Pixel Watch 3. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Watch 8 is known for offering more detailed data with better hardware sensors.</p><p>That should continue with the Galaxy Watch 8. We know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Samsung is working on blood-glucose monitoring technology</a> based on patent filings, but it's not clear whether this feature could be ready for the brand's next smartwatch.</p><p>Either way, it'll feature the new Samsung BioActive Sensor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">added to the Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which hasn't reached its full potential yet. Given that a Samsung executive teased new health features at its recent earnings call, it's safe to expect the Galaxy Watch 8 to add new tools and metrics using that BioActive Sensor.</p>

<p>Right now, it's too early to say whether the Galaxy Watch 8 will be better than the Pixel Watch 3. If you're after AI features and advanced health metrics, there's a good chance Samsung's upcoming smartwatch will impress. However, the Pixel Watch 3 is catered more to a casual audience, and it's unlikely the Galaxy Watch 8 will beat Google's smartwatch in that regard.</p><p>Of course, more leaks and rumors will continue to pile in as the Galaxy Watch 8 launch gets closer, so stay tuned to our coverage for more.</p>

<p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/global-accessibility-awareness-day-samsung-auracast-transforms-cathedral-acoustics-with-unmatched-audio-clarity/">shared newsroom post</a>, Samsung further goes on to explain what’s actually went on at the event — “Auracast microphones and transmitters will broadcast audio directly into participants’ Galaxy Buds3 Pro or GN hearing aids, decreasing background noise to enhance clarity.”</p><p>Prior to the May 16th event, Samsung even had a pilot event in May to showcase the potential of Auracast, wherein the participants seemed to have shared their experiences as well.</p><p>“The experience with the tour guide was amazing,” said one participant.</p><p>“Ordinarily I wouldn’t be able to join in with the tour because I would be unable to hear properly, but today it was completely different. This technology allowed me to hear everything so clearly so I didn’t miss a word.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-hero-closeup.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Auracast feature allows users to enable “simultaneous audio streaming to multiple devices, listeners can enjoy a unified and enriched experience whether using earbuds or a compatible hearing aid."</p><p>The Auracast utilizes LE Audio — the power-efficient and higher-quality Bluetooth wireless transmission technology, which has been adopted by various Samsung products like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and even the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, also got the support through a software update.</p><p>Other than the shared audio experiences, other notable benefits of Auracast include seamless audio hand-off, better audio clarity, and personalized sound, which can be tweaked through settings — helping users with varying hearing abilities.</p><p>The London event is an indication of Samsung’s commitment to accessibility and to be able to redefine hearing accessibility for users through its products. Auracast is set to be playing a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer audio and compatible hearing devices — all to ensure a better listening experience.</p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 and 970 are more expensive than their predecessors. Other 2025 Garmin watches skimped on new features to keep prices low, so I'm happy Garmin didn't hold back on its Forerunners. But it's also become clearer that Garmin doesn't feel a need to compete with other brands' features — only against itself.</p><p>The jump between the $599 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> and $749 Forerunner 970 is significant. You get the newest Elevate v5 generation for better HR accuracy, ECGs and skin temperature readings, flashlight, mic & speaker for calling and commands, sapphire crystal protection, and new metrics like running tolerance.</p><p>Or if you're weighing the $549 Forerunner 270 against the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, you also get the gen5 HR accuracy boost, doubled screen brightness on a larger display, the same mic & speaker, and skin temperature with heat acclimation.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a> stuck to last-gen HR sensors, treading water on hardware so that Garmin could keep them in their fixed price ranges. I feared Garmin would do the same with its Forerunners, making us wait until 2027 for real changes.</p><p>That's why I'm excited for the Forerunner 970, but also feeling frustrated at how Garmin holds back mid-tier watches like the Forerunner 570.</p>

<p>The $499 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3 didn't have offline maps</a> despite being an "adventure" watch, while cheaper rival watches like the $349 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a> and Suunto Race S did. I complained at the time, but Garmin hadn't given it storage space for maps, prioritizing a lightweight CPU for battery life.</p><p>The $549 Forerunner 570 <em>does</em> have storage space for maps, and no need to hold back the processor. There's no logistical reason it <em>shouldn't</em> support maps; even if they're not pre-downloaded like on the 970, Garmin could let you download a specific region's topo data, at least.</p><p>The only real explanation is that their absence makes people more likely to pay for the 970.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The same applies to the 570 health sensors. I obviously appreciate the enhanced HR accuracy and skin temperature. But every other gen5 watch has ECGs, including the $449 Venu 3. And outside of Garmin, ECGs are the norm, from mainstream watches to fitness rivals like the COROS APEX and Polar Vantage series.</p><p>But Garmin ignores the context of its rivals; the only competitor that matters is the Forerunner 970. That needs to stand out, so the 570 misses out. Heart health warnings become a $750 bargaining chip.</p><p>It's a common-enough strategy for Garmin. With the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>, you can't see your training load even though it clearly <em>calculates</em> load in the background to determine your VO2 Max, recovery time, and daily suggested workouts with anaerobic or low aerobic focuses. Blocking that data upsells you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>.</p><p>I accepted <em>that</em> artificial feature block because the 165 costs $249, and training load is still fairly niche. But Garmin watch prices keep creeping up. It's harder to swallow blocked features when these mid-tier models cost much more than a Galaxy or Apple Watch.</p>
<h2 id="with-garmin-watches-every-component-has-a-price-tag-2">With Garmin watches, every component has a price tag</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mic-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 rendered in a black void, angled from the bottom to emphasize the titanium bezel and the screen showing a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartwatch "tiers" are common enough these days, and every company wants to upsell you. But they're also selective about which features are price-locked because they know it'll look bad if a competitor offers something for much less.</p><p>You obviously pay more for steel or titanium casing, or other hardware boosts like better battery life. But otherwise, they squeeze most features into the mainline model while sticking to the same pricing every year (aside from the occasional inflationary boost).</p><p>With Garmin, every new feature to modernize its watches comes with a price bump. MIP-to-AMOLED display swaps for the Forerunner and Instinct lineups cost tacked on another $50–100 to the usual price. On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, collectively adding AMOLED, better sensors, and a mic & speaker added $200 to the price.</p><p>You won't find dual-band GPS on any watch $300 or less, nor offline maps on any sub-$600 watch. And even though Garmin's Gen5 HR sensors came out in 2023, it will keep using the Gen4 sensors on "cheaper" models like the $500 Instinct 3 today.</p><p>I don't know how much the components cost Garmin, but it wants <em>us</em> to know that it'll pass that cost onto us.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 on a woman's wrist at the track, the screen showing her taking a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other factors like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">tariff concerns</a> bump up pricing, too. But Garmin's 2025 strategy establishes a clear Garmin precedent: Once a watch costs a certain price, you shouldn't expect new hardware at that price, nor features already established at the flagship tier.</p><p>The next version will either cost the same but make minimal upgrades, or add new tools and cost much more.</p><p>Garmin treats any new feature as an opportunity to ask athletes for more money in exchange for more value. And it can do this because it doesn't feel as much pressure to price its fitness watches competitively as other brands.</p><p>Garmin users like its ecosystem too much — or are too invested in it — to leave. And so Garmin accepts the negative press around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect+ paywalled features</a> and price-locks the coolest new features because its loyal customers will pay $750 or more for them, even if they grumble about it.</p><p>If you think the Forerunner 970 and 570 are too expensive, then at least you know the last-gen Garmin watches are still available — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/amazon-quietly-drops-huge-sale-on-garmin-smartwatches-here-are-the-5-deals-that-matter">discounted for Memorial Day</a>, so a Forerunner 965 costs $50 less than the 570.</p><p>Otherwise, we have to accept this new normal with new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p>

<p>Morning everyone!</p><p>Technically, Google I/O 2025 is already underway, as Google gave us an early look at what's coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show: I/O Edition</a>. Material 3 Expressive brings about one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">more drastic UI overhauls</a> that Google has undertaken, bringing it to our phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and smartwatches via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qKvRnMeZRAVc4uAG4zEFZH" name="gmail-fitbit-photos-material-3-expressive-animations" alt="Animations and design changes in Fitbit, Gmail, and Google Photos with Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qKvRnMeZRAVc4uAG4zEFZH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From everything we've seen so far, it's not just about making your phone and watch more personal, but aims to improve on aspects that you might not pay close attention to. This includes things like UI animations, buttons, all while retaining the essence of what Material You was all about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b" name="material-3-expressive-wear-os-6-themes-2" alt="New Material 3 Expressive themes in Wear OS 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, we're finally getting more customization options, and we don't mean more watch faces. Material 3 Expressive brings the ability to change color of the entire UI, so you can either match the color to your phone, or opt for something a bit different.</p><p>Not only that, but various UI elements are also being redesigned in order to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">smartwatches</a> easier to interact with. Buttons and notifications will now "hug the display," maximizing the screen real estate and hopefully resulting in a much better experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more obvious focal points of I/O 2025 is going to be Gemini. The Android Show got the ball rolling, as Gemini will soon be available on the likes of Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV</a>, Android Auto, and Android XR. This comes following Google's replacement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">Assistant with Gemini</a> earlier this year, so the company must feel as though it's evolved enough to make it more widely available.</p><p>Arguably, the platform getting the biggest Gemini upgrade is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, with Google claiming it operates as a "more intuitive assistant." You'll still be able to perform simple tasks, but Gemini is also capable of understanding more complex requests.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CmihoNf7sLuELLGY4jvxTV" name="google-tv-streamer-chromecast-with-google-tv-2.jpg" alt="Chromecast with Google TV on top of Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmihoNf7sLuELLGY4jvxTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, but even Google TV is getting a Gemini upgrade, albeit one that's a bit smaller than other services. Once available, you'll be able to summon Gemini and ask it for specific recommendations.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">announcement</a>, Google said "you can ask for action movies that are age-appropriate for your kids." Plus, you can ask generalized questions, and along with a response, Gemini and Google TV will provide related videos for you to watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GP88S45QTxg4dxDr5Vrxo3" name="google-smart-glasses-sameer-samat-02" alt="Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses, as seen on The Android Show I/O Edition 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GP88S45QTxg4dxDr5Vrxo3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screen captures from The Android Show I/O Edition 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We know that Gemini is going to be a big deal at I/O 2025, but there's a pretty good chance Android XR steals the show. Despite there not being any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>-powered hardware just yet, Google gave us a glimpse at some of the things that Gemini will be able to do.</p><p>At one point during The Android Show, Android president Sameer Samat appeared on screen wearing some sunglasses that look similar to Ray-Bans. However, as my colleague Nick Sutrich points out, these are likely "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">Google and Samsung's upcoming smart glasses</a>, complete with tinted lenses."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NHCfHg2tAgLN97VNQoSL9f" name="samsung-project-moohan-google-android-show-demo" alt="A Samsung Project Moohan headset on a shelf during The Android Show 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NHCfHg2tAgLN97VNQoSL9f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the smart glasses are pretty awesome in their own right, that's not all we're expecting in the way of Android XR at Google I/O 2025. For a brief moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> was spotted in the background during The Android Show.</p><p>Hopefully, this is where we will learn even more about the upcoming XR headset, as it's rumored to launch sometime in "mid-2025." And what better time to spill the beans than at Google I/O, when the platform will be on full display. Pun intended.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-sleep-sensing-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Nest Hub (2nd Gen)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was one surprising omission when it came to the most recent batch of announcements, and that's the lack of any mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">regarding Nest devices</a>. It's been over four years since the most recent Nest Hub was released, and even longer since the Nest Audio was introduced.</p><p>However, Google has hardly mentioned its smart home platform at all, besides announcing that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">dropping support</a> for a variety of devices. We can't help but wonder what plans Google has for the platform, whether it be in the way of new hardware or not.</p><p>I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that this will be a surprise announcement during the I/O 2025 Keynote.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-acer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-pixel-tablet-stacked" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, and Pixel Tablet all stacked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that we're curious about is whether Google will share any upcoming plans for Chromebooks, tablets, or Android's revamped Desktop Mode. The latter made a surprise appearance at the end of The Android Show, but we aren't exactly sure what device it was being shown on.</p><p>And while rumors regarding a potential "Pixel Laptop" have subsided, we can't help but wonder what the future holds for Chromebooks and tablets. Neither are going away any time soon, but there hasn't been much on that front since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a> debuted last Fall.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4039px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.99%;"><img id="7UcYgeq4EJsnTtxZwMpPPc" name="IMG_20250425_121237334_HDR" alt="Colorful Google sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7UcYgeq4EJsnTtxZwMpPPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4039" height="3029" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's pretty obvious that Google is trying to balance the fine line between catering to developers and just turning I/O into a party for everyone. That being said, we're also curious as to what the structure of the Keynote will actually be. With Material 3 Expressive out of the way, and Android 16 likely arriving in June, is there even anything else for Google to share?</p><p>On the flip side, if you just browse through the various planned sessions, you can see that we're going to spending quite a bit of time sifting through everything. Even with four main "Focus Areas," there are a bunch of sessions for each, with varying degrees of complexity.</p><p>Nevertheless, Google I/O is one of the more exciting events of the year, and we can't to see what's to come.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in Google’s world over the course of the last year. Google I/O 2025 will commence tomorrow at 1PM ET, where we’ll learn much more about what we can hope to see from the confines of Mountain View over the next 12 months.</p><p>Yesterday, we covered pretty much everything that was shown off during The Android Show, with Google pulling back the veil on a bit for the first time. As we try to figure out what the next year will offer, all we really have to do is jump in the time machine to last year’s I/O.</p>
<p>Last year wasn’t <em>quite </em>as bad as I/O 2023, when Google said “AI” more than 120 times over the course of its 2-hour-long Keynote. However, AI and Gemini were still the primary focus at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements"><u>I/O 2024</u></a>, with the Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro models being.</p><p>This was also where Google first debuted Gemini Live, which essentially lets you have a conversation with Gemini, including being able to interrupt it mid-sentence. At first, this was only available for Gemini Advanced subscribers, but it’s now available for everyone.</p><p><br>Google even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/articles/gemini-on-android/"><u>recently updated</u></a> Gemini Live, offering the “ability to share your Android camera or screen within your Gemini Live conversation.” And the best part is that you don’t need to sign up for Gemini Advanced, as it’s available for everyone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I/O 2024 also provided some rather concrete evidence that Google was working on something revolutionary for the AR/VR/XR space. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024"><u>Project Astra</u></a> was announced during the Keynote, which is simply “a multimodal AI assistant.” In the promo video, a person is shown wearing glasses with built-in cameras and microphones, making it possible to ask Gemini questions and get answers without needing to use your phone.</p><p><br>Fast forward to now, and Android President Sameer Samat wore sunglasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/androids-president-is-looking-slick-wearing-googles-new-smart-glasses"><u>that look similar</u></a> to the Meta Ray Bans. These weren’t explicitly said to be the rumored Gemini-powered smart glasses, but it doesn’t take rocket science to put two and two together here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3fNtkpQkWb2Uk9PythAxRo" name="Google-logo-G-statue-mountain-view-1.jpeg" alt="A statue of the multicolored "G" in Google on the Google campus in Mountain View" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fNtkpQkWb2Uk9PythAxRo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google AI Overview has been one of the biggest visual changes to Search in years. Whether you’re looking up the answer to a question or trying to do a bit of research, AI Overview is right at the top of the page.</p><p>Instead of just throwing a bunch of links at you, AI Overview attempts to summarize the information provided within the most popular search results. More importantly, this feature also provides quick access to whatever websites were cited within the explanation. <br><br>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report"><u>recent report</u></a> revealed that “Google’s AI Overview have led to a 49% increase in search impressions.” Although click-through rates on provided links are down by as much as 30%, Google’s commitment, along with regular updates, means that we’re a far cry from Gemini telling us to put “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound"><u>glue cheese on pizza</u></a>.”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be for another four months before the final version of Android 15 would be released, with Android 15 Beta 2 being released on Day 2 of I/O 2024. The update was relatively minor, but it introduced new features such as “Private Space,” letting you hide apps in a separate area on your phone.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 2 also brought about the floating taskbar that could be pinned to the bottom of the screen. It’s a feature that has become absolutely essential for Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Android tablet owners, providing quick access to the apps in your Dock. Along with being able to create App Pairs, these combos can be pinned to the dock, making multitasking even more seamless.</p>

<p>You didn't think that Google would make it through I/O 2024 without bringing some AI magic to Android, did you? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, first introduced in January 2024, was updated to handle "complex math and physics problems." But Google didn't just implement the upgrade and call it a day, instead, it ensured that you could see the steps, which could help you learn how to solve the problems on your own.</p><p>Additionally, Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a> with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">multimodality</a> would be arriving on select Pixel phones later in the year. At the time, Google focused on how this functionality would improve Android's "TalkBack" feature by making it so devices could "process text with a better understanding of sounds, sights, and even spoken language."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3NZf8mpU7sqJgrbjuMjeth" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-on-tree" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 laying against a tree trunk, showing a data-heavy watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NZf8mpU7sqJgrbjuMjeth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To accompany Android 15, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces" target="_blank">Wear OS 5</a> was introduced, which is actually based on Android 14. Nevertheless, this update offered a mixture of customization and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">health and fitness tracking enhancements</a> while also aiming to improve battery life.</p><p>A variety of new watch faces were made available, in addition to four running form measurements: Ground Contact Time, Stride Length, Vertical Oscillation, and Vertical Ratio. This, along with new workout watch face compilations and "debounced goals," showed us that Google was attempting to appeal to the Fitbit user base. As Fitbit wearables waned, the company hoped these changes would result in more interest in the Pixel Watch lineup.</p>

<p>Now that we've recapped what I/O 2024 had for us, it's time to try and figure out what I/O might have in store. As mentioned yesterday, we know that there will be as much AI and Gemini that Google can fit, but we expect to also learn more about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> platform.</p><p>We don't need to go far in order to start putting the pieces of the puzzle together. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore">Google I/O 2025 website</a> has a page dedicated to the variety of Keynotes and Sessions that will be on tap. Of these, there are four "Focus Areas," including AI, Android, Cloud, and Web.</p><p>Of course, these are geared towards developers, as this is a developer conference after all. But Google also makes these sessions available for anyone, even if you couldn't make your way to the Shoreline Amphitheater to be there in person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9xyrBgH8udaYLCgprzvsa5" name="Android-16-logo-blue-Honor-magic-7-pro" alt="A blue and orange Android 16 logo on an Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9xyrBgH8udaYLCgprzvsa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We know Google will have more to say about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, especially after showing off Material 3 Expressive during The Android Show. However, we also can't help but wonder if the company will take the time to explain why Android is now on an "accelerated timeline."</p><p>Traditionally, a new version of Android is released in the Fall, with the first beta usually arriving a month or so before I/O. Android 16 changes all of that, as the first Developer Preview landed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">November 2024</a>, just a little more than a month after Android 15 dropped.</p><p>While we don't know yet for sure, leaks and rumors suggest an early-June release for the final Android 16 build.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking-angled.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Initially, we didn't think that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> was going to be a massive update. With Beta 1, Google implemented changes that allow apps to better adapt to fit larger screens, such as when you're using a foldable and go from the cover screen to the inner screen.</p><p>Another new feature is called "Live Updates," which is similar to Apple's Live Activities. This puts a constantly-updating notification in your notification shade, providing up-to-the-minute information from various apps.</p><p>Beta 2 was focused on the camera, as a new "hybrid auto-exposure mode" was made available for developers. Plus, Google added support for AVIF formatting and UltraHDR support for HEIC-formatted images.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-gets-gemini-2-5-flash-as-it-prepares-to-launch-as-a-standalone-app">announced</a> that Gemini 2.5 Flash would be powering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-us-launch-new-features">NotebookLM</a>, while stating that the NotebookLM mobile app would be launching at I/O 2025. It seems that Google couldn't stand to wait just one more day, as the NotebookLM app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-standalone-app-android-debut-play-store">now available</a> to download from the Google Play Store.</p><p>The upgrade to Gemini 2.5 Flash is important, as it brings "advanced reasoning techniques," and provides "more comprehensive answers, particularly to complex, multi-step reasoning questions." Until now, NotebookLM was only available on the web, with many hoping that a mobile app would be released. Thankfully for some, the wait is officially over.</p>

Since setting up a new phone can be overwhelming, these tips aim to help streamline the process by focusing on what you should change, enable, or disable first.</p><p>This is all in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/things-do-after-setting-android-phone">first things you should do when setting up a new Android phone</a> (another article we recommend you check out). So let's get to it, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-off-ram-boost"><span>Turn off RAM Boost</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFjM2YR9A3nth53scB94gk" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-45" alt="Performance menu on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFjM2YR9A3nth53scB94gk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This goes first because this will require for you to restart your phone. While we generally don't care for virtual RAM features like RAM Boost, Motorola enables it by default on its phones. However, we find that you rarely ever need it (the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has 16GB of RAM, after all) and in some cases <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">it can make performance worse</a>.</p><p>We suggest turning this feature off as soon as you go through the initial setup. Navigate to <strong>Settings > System > Performance</strong>, where you'll find the <strong>RAM Boost</strong> option. Turn this off, and the phone will prompt you to restart the device for the change to take effect.</p><p>After you've done so, we recommend going back and enabling <strong>Smart app launch</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-and-adjust-display-colors"><span>Change and adjust display colors</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xLoh7rQLA7SGm7LL4n2nkC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-30" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xLoh7rQLA7SGm7LL4n2nkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4068" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola's displays have improved over the years, and the Razr 2025 series features some good-looking ones, especially with the Pantone Validated display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. One way to get the most out of your display is to ensure the colors are just as vibrant as you want them to be, and Motorola makes it easy to set this up.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Colors</strong>, and you'll find a few options to choose from. These will change how the display presents colors. <strong>Natural</strong> is a more realistic representation, and while it appears more muted than the other two options, the colors here are optimized depending on the contents of your screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:327px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.65%;"><img id="FFdp5nyeHTyVF6brXVEGfY" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-display-color-settings" alt="Display color settings for the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFdp5nyeHTyVF6brXVEGfY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="327" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Radiant</strong> option is an in-between option for users who want a little pop but not too much. Colors are a bit more vibrant and saturated, but the difference isn't too dramatic compared to <strong>Natural</strong>.</p><p>Lastly, there's <strong>Vivid</strong>, which punches things up to the max and is for users who really like for their colors to pop.</p><p>However, in addition to these general settings, users can also adjust the color temperature using the color wheel at the bottom. There are <strong>Cool</strong> and <strong>Warm</strong> options at the bottom to make it easy, or you can go the <strong>Custom</strong> route and select from the wheel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-control-center-style"><span>Change Control Center style</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3942px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jiucdiNVAh58YnF37zXVz" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-47" alt="Quick settings menu on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiucdiNVAh58YnF37zXVz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3942" height="2217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Android 14, Motorola has given users the option between two styles for the Control Center, the pulldown menu where quick settings toggles are found. By default, it goes with the Pixel-style Control Center, with large buttons and the notification center below it. However, you can change this to a more modern style if you want, something more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are adopting.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Home & lock screen > Control center</strong>. From here, tap <strong>Modern Style</strong>, which will switch to a two-panel control center, with Quick Settings on one side and notifications on the other. Each panel will take up the entire screen instead of sharing a screen, which means you'll be able to see more notifications or Quick Settings toggles by default.</p><p>If you tap the Settings cog, you can also set which side you want notifications and Quick Settings.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-disable-the-games-folder"><span>Disable the Games folder</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iNqYdsQjzg758FQNHkE2J3" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-46" alt="The Games folder on the Razr Ultra 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iNqYdsQjzg758FQNHkE2J3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola has done a great job minimizing bloatware on its phones, and normally this isn't something you have to deal with to an extreme on flagships. On the Razr series, the most glaring example of this is the Games folder in the app drawer, which is generated by default.</p><p>This wouldn't really be an issue, but the folder not only houses your games, but is basically a repository for ads in the form of game recommendations, courtesy of Motorola's Games app. Frankly, it's not for me, so the first thing I did was disable it, which is fairly easy.</p><p>In the app drawer, hit the three dots in the top right corner and navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps</strong>, where you'll find the option to toggle the Games folder off. Once you do, it disappears from your app drawer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-cover-screen"><span>Set up the cover screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5GofuTebXUZBzxUpM527ub" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-26" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 with the Weather panel on the cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5GofuTebXUZBzxUpM527ub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things about having a flip phone is the cover screen. It was great on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>, got better on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr series</a>, and continues to improve with the Razr 2025 (thanks to Android 15).</p><p>Setting up the cover screen on the Razr 2025 series is simple (it's about the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">as it was on the Razr Plus 2024</a>), although it'll take some work. With the phone open, navigate to <strong>Settings> External display</strong>, where you'll find all the most important settings for the cover screen. Go through each of these options to change your home and lock screens, adjust display and font size, change call behavior, and more.</p><p>We especially like the Music player, which sets a cool animated display when music is playing.</p>

<p>One thing you won't be able to do from this menu is set your cover screen panels. For this, you need to close the phone. <strong>Tap and hold</strong> the cover screen home page (or <strong>pinch the display</strong> from any panel) and you'll find an overview of all your active panels. You can drag them around or tap <strong>Edit</strong> to add or delete panels.</p><p>Once you're done managing panels, navigate to your Apps panel and tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the corner. Here, you'll be able to add apps and app shortcuts to the panel, and you can tap and hold to rearrange them once they're added. Go to the Widgets panel to do the same thing.</p><p>As a note, you can add up to three panels each for Apps and Widgets.</p>

<p>After a brief beta phase, Moto AI is a big focus for the Razr 2025 series. It can seem overwhelming to some, especially since you already have Gemini and Perplexity preloaded onto the phone. However, you only have to interact with Moto AI as much as you want, and you can just let it fade into the background.</p><p>We have a whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI explainer</a> that we suggest you take a look at, which will go through the settings, capabilities, and more, so that you can get the most (or least) out of it.</p>

<p>Moto AI is here in full force, and while Motorola gives you quite a few ways to trigger it, there are two you'll want to enable off the bat (and you can forget about the rest, honestly). If you have the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, then you'll have access to both of these options.</p><p>The AI Key lets you activate Moto AI or specific Moto AI features depending on how you press it. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures > AI Key</strong> to set the behaviors. For now, your options are limited to <strong>Press & Hold</strong> (to activate Moto AI) and <strong>Double Press</strong> (to activate Catch me up or Pay Attention).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 from the side showcasing the AI key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up Look & Talk is a little more involved. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Moto AI > Launch gestures > Look & Talk</strong>. To turn this feature on, you'll be prompted to enable Face Unlock on your phone. Tap <strong>Set up</strong> and follow the prompts to scan your face. Once that's done, Look & Talk should be enabled.</p><p>Now, once you set your Razr Ultra in Tent or Stand mode, it will begin searching for your face. Once you directly face it, Moto AI will trigger and you can start speaking to your phone.</p><p>Furthermore, you can go back into the Launch gestures menu to experiment with other gestures, but we suggest sticking to these two for Moto AI.</p>

<p>One of the best things about owning a Motorola phone is all the cool and unique gestures you get. This includes chopping the phone twice to enable the flashlight and twisting the phone twice to turn on the camera (you'd be surprised how convenient these are).</p><p>Even better is that all of these features are found in one spot, so you can experiment with what works for you. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures</strong> to check out all of the gesture options at your disposal. Here are some of my suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>[If you're using Gesture navigation] In <strong>System navigation</strong>, make sure Circle to Search is enabled. Then tap the settings cog in <strong>Gesture navigation</strong> to ensure Swipe for Assistant is toggled on for easy access to Gemini without using the wake word.</li><li>Enable the <strong>Sidebar</strong> for quick access to apps from nearly any screen.</li><li>For the <strong>Power Key</strong>, set the Press & hold option to Power Menu, as it will default to your digital assistant.</li><li>Enable <strong>Slide on power key</strong> for Quick Settings and notifications.</li><li>Enable <strong>Quick Launch</strong> and set it to open an app or function of your choice. For ease of use, I use this to take screenshots, as it's easier than the two-button or three-finger method. Set whatever tap strength you think is appropriate.</li><li>Ensure <strong>Quick Capture</strong> and <strong>Fast Flash</strong> are turned on.</li></ul>

<p>Motorola's Razr 2025 series takes advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> form factor with Camcorder mode, which lets you record videos by folding the phone at a 90-degree angle and holding it like you would a camcorder. You can even use the bottom half to zoom in and out easily using your thumb, making for a more stable video recording experience.</p><p>In the camera app, tap the icon at the top left, then hit <strong>Settings</strong>. Scroll down and tap <strong>Camcorder mode</strong>. Enable it and toggle on <strong>Auto recording</strong> if you want the phone to begin recording as soon as you flip the phone horizontally and fold it while the camera is on. You can also choose when to <strong>Start recording</strong>, either immediately or after a 3-second countdown.</p>

<p>Protection is essential, and smartphones have become vital parts of our lives. With phones like the Razr Ultra 2025 costing more than $1000, you'll definitely want to invest in some protection to keep it from breaking.</p><p>Thankfully, the nature of flip phones and the alternative materials Motorola utilizes means you don't have to worry about the pack panel or primary display breaking.</p><p>That said, the cover screen is very exposed, and you'll want to protect the phone as best you can from falls and other such incidents. Fortunately, we've compiled some useful collections of cases and screen protectors for each Razr 2025 model, which are definitely worth looking at.</p>

<p>This year hits differently. There has been a lot of work on "morphing" the UI in a dynamic way; moving things around, rotating your phone, or opening more than one app on the screen all have a bit of special flair. You might love it or you might hate it, but it's there for everyone to see.</p><p>One thing that wasn't talked about a lot (yet) was a tablet. After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">Android Show</a>, Google's Dieter Bohn took a few minutes to show off some cool Android phones, but no tablets. Maybe Google has a lot more to say about them, but nothing worth putting front and center before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcementshttps://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">big developer conference</a> kicks off.</p>
<p>I do think we'll hear more about tablets during I/O, but I'm almost positive we're going to hear a lot more about foldables. Something tells me that Google thinks foldables have a real shot at (finally) being the mainstream device that will change the mobile tech landscape. And let's be honest — hearing <em>anything</em> that's not all about AI would be nice.</p>

<p>It's hard for any company that makes Android devices to compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">Apple's iPad</a>. That's by design; Apple made sure there was a device to hit every price point, and they come in sizes to suit everyone. If you've ever used one, you know the iPad is a solid device.</p><p>Something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Galaxy Tab S</a> is also a solid device, but it lacks the traction of the iPad. No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship Android tablet</a> goes head-to-head with an iPad. I dunno why, but it is what it is. People buy Android tablets because they either need something cheap for the kids or because they're entrenched in Samsung's ecosystem of products.</p>
<p>You can not buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> that doesn't run Android. Dead stop. Some models from companies like Huawei aren't "official" but even if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-harmony-os-just-android-hat-and-sunglasses">name says something else</a> it's based on Android. That's because anyone can download the code and do whatever they want with it. Apple will get on board soonish and make a foldable, but for now, anyone interested in a phone that flips or folds open only sees Android.</p><p>Google has to take advantage of this. I know we see and hear things every year about "large-form-factor" or multi-screen devices, but I think Android 16 is going to be different, and more than just talk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.86%;"><img id="sWw3XSx8DcXK7yyDjyAYpg" name="HarmonyOS-13-integration.jpg" alt="HarmonyOS 3 phone and tablet integration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWw3XSx8DcXK7yyDjyAYpg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1077" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldables do stand a chance to change everything, too. Right now, there are two issues with the category: price and durability. You may love them (I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-havent-switched-phones-for-almost-a-year-and-i-love-it">Moto Razr is one of the best phones I've ever had</a>), but you can't deny they cost more and they're more fragile.</p><p>What I like to call the fragility factor gets better every year. You still have to have a plastic coating protecting an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-z-flips-ultra-thin-glass-may-not-be-glass-after-all" target="_blank">astonishingly thin layer of glass</a>, and any deep scratch is going to bust everything to hell, but that's the nature of the beast. Designs now incorporate protections for the display surfaces, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">hinges are stronger</a> and have less wiggle, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-display-crease-reduction-rumor">the ugly crease</a> is getting less prominent with every new release. A foldable will never be a tough phone you can use on a construction site, but they'll stand up to normal abuse a lot better than they used to.</p><p>Cost is also becoming less of a factor, albeit not as quickly as durability. Foldables, especially book-style devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel Fold</a>, are expensive to design, full of expensive parts, and flat-out cost more. That's not going to change.</p><p>But consider this: you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook</a>, or you can buy a future version of the Galaxy Z Fold that almost replaces all three. Yes, you're reading that right: Jerry is saying that there's a chance foldables replace not only phones and tablets but laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/ask-jerry-choosing-the-right-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, too. Call me crazy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will that really happen? I dunno. You don't know either, and neither can Google or Samsung. But it <em>could</em> if the tech is built with this future in mind and the software makes a foldable something that "just works". Part of that is making it pleasant to use, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/material-3-expressive-is-return-to-form-pixel-watch-4-needs">seeing screen elements shape-shift</a> when you open a display, or being able to adjust multiple apps to size them appropriately on a single screen. You know, just like a laptop.</p><p>I'm not ready to call the death of the tablet and will never say the laptop can be replaced by a phone. But I don't build consumer electronics or write software for them. I just use what works best for me. If one day, a foldable is what works best because Google finally took the category more seriously, I'd save a lot of cash and buy that one magic device.</p>

According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5262">The Elec</a>, Samsung is reportedly considering adding the S26 Edge to its next flagship series, potentially launching it in place of the Galaxy S26 Plus.</p><p>This aligns with the report's claim that Samsung has seen lower sales figures for its Plus models over the past few years. This trend could continue even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>, as Samsung is projected to ship only 6.7 million units of the Plus model.</p><p>It is important to note that the Galaxy S24 Plus also sold approximately 6.77 million units in its initial 11 months post-launch, a similar number to what they estimate for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. However, by the end of 2024, the Plus model's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/articles/galaxy-s24-plus-hit-im-195259486.html" target="_blank">sales shot up </a>by 54% compared to its predecessor, selling about 7.4 million units.</p><p>Despite this late and consistent rise in sales for the Plus variant, the device's performance has been lower when compared to the standard and Ultra models, which sold 13.6 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="trading-plus-for-edge-2">Trading 'Plus' for 'Edge'</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's just speculation for now, so we should take it with a grain of salt. However, if it turns out to be true, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, feels that swapping out the Plus variant could actually play in Samsung's favor.</p><p>"The Edge variant could potentially serve as an alternative to the Plus, but this also opens the door for Samsung to nudge a Plus consumer to buy up the stack and spend on an Ultra instead," he tells me.</p><p>That said, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> arrives with one major drawback — the company seems to have traded in battery life (3,900 mAh) for sleekness. That is something not many users will be happy about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9BPRQASXSx2JKztWzsp97g" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-exclusive-samsung-colors-04" alt="The three Samsung.com exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9BPRQASXSx2JKztWzsp97g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a consumer's perspective, a key factor when purchasing a phone is its battery life, minimizing the need to reach for your charger. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://paylesspower.com/blog/battery-basics/">report</a> by Payless Power indicates that a significant majority, 59%, of Americans believe Android phones offer superior battery performance compared to iPhones, and 22% of consumers would even switch brands to obtain better battery life.</p><p>Considering the above, it seems unlikely that individuals would exchange a premium device featuring a substantial 4,900 mAh battery for one that seemingly compromises on battery capacity. Even though Samsung claims that the Galaxy S25 Edge can last an entire day with normal usage, that's just subjective to individual usage patterns.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/14/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-report-replace/"> 9to5Google</a>, early reactions to the Galaxy S25 Edge have been largely focused on "questioning why the device exists, especially considering its very tiny battery compared to other flagships in Samsung’s lineup."</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-2">Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus</h2>
<p>Historically, the Galaxy S-series Plus caters to people who prefer a larger display, with a focus on performance and battery life, as opposed to how light or sleek the phone is. These consumers are also less concerned with spending the exorbitant amounts that come with buying an Ultra with all its extra features.</p><p>In contrast, with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung aimed to innovate in design, trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-5-key-rumored-features-from-an-ultra-thin-frame-to-so-so-battery-life">beat Apple to the punch</a> by creating a slimmer and lighter phone that delivers the same performance as a flagship device.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge may not have all the specs of the Plus variant, the two carry some similarities. Both have a premium build,  the same high-res AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite"> Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset,</a> both devices run on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">One UI 7,</a> backed by Android 15, and come with similar AI capabilities.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Samsung should go beyond just the battery and explore Qualcomm’s advancements in reducing power consumption</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The sleek design of the Galaxy S25 Edge nudged the company to omit an additional telephoto lens, limiting its zoom capability and reducing its battery size. In essence, both these models are more alike than the other phones in the lineup, which could be why Samsung may be switching one for the other.</p><p>According to Ubrani, if Samsung intends to discontinue a middle-tier model, certain improvements are crucial for consumer adoption. However, addressing concerns about battery capacity could be a major priority, he feels that Samsung should go beyond just the battery and delve into "Qualcomm’s advancements in reducing power consumption," which could be a significant step.</p><p>Ubrani suggests that continuing the collaboration with Qualcomm, as seen in the Galaxy S25 series, might be "the primary way to improve battery life" for a streamlined device.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-edge-be-able-to-keep-up-with-the-plus-2">Will the Edge be able to keep up with the Plus?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Only time will tell.</p><p>While the Plus variant has a strong and steady fan base since its inception, it's hard to say whether or not this new Edge variant would be accepted by the audience at large.</p><p>For now, The Elec adds that "NPA (alleged codename for the Galaxy S26 lineup) is starting with standard, Edge, and Ultra models in mind, but may change Edge back to Plus if Galaxy S25 Edge doesn’t perform well."</p><p>That said, if Samsung does indeed decide to ditch its Plus model, due to the lag in sales when compared to the other two variants, it might be a logical decision when it comes to generating revenue. Additionally, Samsung has featured a consistent lineup for years, with the standard, Plus, and Ultra models. This move could also indicate a potential shift in the company's strategy to cater to evolving consumer preferences, which could come as a refreshing change.</p><p>"Assuming all goes well and the Edge costs more than the Plus, then this could lead to greater revenue for Samsung as users transition to the Edge or Ultra," Ubrani adds.</p>

It revealed some of the significant developments much earlier than expected, giving users a full look at what's in store with Gemini, Material 3 Expressive, and its updated safety and privacy tools.</p><p>First up, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">Gemini comes to more devices</a>. Gemini is expanding across the Android ecosystem, replacing Google Assistant on phones and integrating into Wear OS, cars, TVs, and XR.</p><p>This integration focuses on providing more intuitive, hands-free, and context-aware AI assistance across various devices. "Like when your hands are covered in flour while cooking, when you’re rushing between meetings, or when you’re in the middle of a bike ride," Google explained in the press release.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, Google is modifying its UI experience to be more expressive and interactive with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. Google explains that M3 Expressive is all about design that feels good, makes sense, and helps you do things with ease. It leans on five key components, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment, to steer the user's attention to the stuff that matters.</p><p>Wear OS 6 is also getting a fresh coat of paint, more customization via color options, and a customizable UI. Watch faces will now be able to change the whole color of the OS, giving the wearable a more thematic feel.</p>

<p>During the show, it announced a whole slew of privacy and security tools that will show up on all Android devices with Android 16.</p><p>New warning systems will be built into Android's caller and Google Messages, which help prevent fraud by sending you pop-up messages when common scam tactics are used.</p><p>For instance, Google Messages is also getting a big security update with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">AI-based detection</a> that can help stop scammers pretending to be government officials or bank employees, or even"tech support" scams, and several other new categories. These messages will be automatically flagged and filtered as spam if spam detection is enabled.</p><p>Google's Find My Device will also evolve into Find Hub with UWB tag support and satellite connectivity for enhanced tracking. The tech giant will partner with airlines to simplify lost luggage recovery using Bluetooth tag location sharing.</p>

While putting them on, he pretty much hinted that Google I/O 2025 would be full of more Android announcements, "and maybe even a few more really cool Android demos."</p><p>This only means we'd be getting more than just a peek at those highly anticipated wearables this year. These smart glasses look a lot like Meta's and have customizable styles. While we know little to nothing about these glasses, they're said to have a small screen in the lens, similar to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses 3</a>.

Discovery announced this week that it will be rebranding Max as HBO Max again. Just two years after ditching the HBO Max name, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the switch will happen this summer.</p><p>This will be the second time the service has changed its name in just three years —first it launched as HBO Max in May 2020, when it was still under WarnerMedia, replacing HBO Now (its standalone streaming option since 2014) while keeping it separate from HBO Go (its old cable-authenticated VOD service that's since been retired).</p><p>Looks like not many users were a fan of this rebranding, and learning from its past mistakes of chasing a "quantity over quality" approach with tons of content. Bringing back the HBO name is a key move in Warner Bros. Discovery, in its plan to grow a global customer base and keep up with other streaming giants.</p><p>The company believes that reintroducing the HBO brand on Max will make things more seamless for customers as to the kind of content they can expect to see.</p>

Pei announced that the Phone 3 will launch this summer. Pei states the company is "going all in" with the device, granting it "premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that levels things up."</p><p>More importantly, Pei all but confirmed to consumers its price, reportedly "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</p><p>Pei adds that users will be given the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details">secure</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">upgraded Android experience</a> within the upcoming Nothing Phone.

It snuck in a quick announcement about the wearable at the end of the Galaxy S25 Edge's press release — something extra for wearable fans.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=53591&u1=ac-ca-4481943900485838052&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fkr%2F%25ec%2582%25bc%25ec%2584%25b1%25ec%25a0%2584%25ec%259e%2590-%25ea%25b0%25a4%25eb%259f%25ad%25ec%258b%259c-s25-%25ec%2597%25a3%25ec%25a7%2580-%25ea%25b3%25b5%25ea%25b0%259c" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Korean website</a>, the new Galaxy Ring is pretty much the same tech-wise as its past versions/ Samsung calls it "Two-Tone Titanium Black," a smooth mix of the classic Titanium Black and Titanium Silver. We weren't able to spot any images of this exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> yet, but it's clear the company is going for a premium vibe here.</p><p>For now, this color is only for the South Korean audience, and it remains unclear whether it will be available on this side of the globe.</p>

<p>The OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 charger is interesting, because it lets you charge a phone, smartwatch, and earbuds all at the same time. The 3-in-1 charger is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-OntheGoTM-Wireless-Portable-Charging/dp/B0F49KPL7T">retailing on Amazon for $99</a>, and there's also a 2-in-1 option <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-OntheGoTM-Wireless-Portable-Charging/dp/B0F4B9ZYMK">that's available for $79</a>. Both variants are sold in three color options — black, desert rose, and sand — and they include 15W Qi 2 charging as standard.</p>

<p>I got the 3-in-1 charger in black and the 2-in-1 variant in sand, and what immediately stood out with these chargers is the design. I tested several Qi 2 charging mats — most recently the Native Union Voyage — and the OntheGo models have a better design and build quality thanks to the vegan leather construction.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bUuZXMXsNAid346QiVbE5B" name="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger" alt="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUuZXMXsNAid346QiVbE5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The foldable design ensures they're easy to stash into a bag, and they don't weigh much at all — the 3-in-1 model comes in at 145.3g, and the 2-in-1 option is 104.5g. Satechi bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and it is color-matched to the charger, which is a nice touch. Another positive is the carrying bag — Satechi includes a cloth bag with either product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="z2VM9JxZoUHxny2zqq2V4B" name="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger" alt="Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Qi 2 Travel Charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2VM9JxZoUHxny2zqq2V4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality is fabulous, and I didn't see any issues in the two weeks I used the products. The leather design feels great, and both chargers include strong magnets. You'll need to use a 36W USB PD wall charger to make the most of the OntheGo 3-in-1, and Satechi recommends a 30W charger with the OntheGo 2-in-1.</p>

<p>There isn't a wall charger bundled with the package, so you will need to use your own — we've rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gan-chargers">best GaN chargers</a> if you're interested in something that's just as easy to travel with as these Satechi chargers. I connected both products to my Nexode 200W charging station, and didn't see any problems in this regard.</p>

<p>The OntheGo 3-in-1 goes up to 25W; it has 15W Qi 2 charging, 5W to charge any earbuds, and 5W for the Apple Watch. The charger unfurls to reveal three charging pads, with the leftmost (the one with the Satechi logo) featuring Qi 2 integration. The earbuds mat is marked accordingly, and smartwatch module raises up to enable Nightstand Mode.</p>

<p>I used it to charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, and it did a terrific job charging all three devices. What's interesting is that you get StandBy mode as well if you angle the charger, and it's convenient if you want to access a calendar, clock, or view your photos while your iPhone is charging.</p>

<p>You can also use the charger with Android phones, but you'll ideally need a MagSafe case with a strong magnet. I tested it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and it did a decent enough job. The OntheGo 2-in-1 is also just as good in its own right, but you miss out on the ability to charge earbuds.</p>

<p>Having used both extensively, I recommend the OntheGo 3-in-1; it is a little bulkier than its 2-in-1 sibling, but you get added versatility, and it doesn't cost much more. Regardless of whichever model you go with, you're getting a terrific travel Qi 2 charger.</p>

<ul><li>Users on the Pixel Phones subreddit report incredibly shortened battery lives following the May patch.</li><li>Reports say their Pixel phone is only managing roughly three-and-a-half hours of battery life, which isn't the norm.</li><li>Throwing a wrench into things are reports from others that say the May update has aided their batteries.</li><li>A similar issue happened in March where some Pixels suffered brightness problems, audio, and vibration issues, which were patched out in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Pixel issues after a monthly security patch reportedly continue, as users bring their voices together online.</p><p>There's a lengthy thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/what_happened_to_pixel/">Pixel Phone subreddit</a> where users are reporting a severe hit to their device's battery life after the latest security update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/05/pixel-battery-life-takes-a-nosedive-after-may-update-say-frustrated-users.html">Android Headlines</a>). The original poster (OP) put up a screenshot of their Pixel's battery usage which showed their Wi-Fi connectivity sucked up 100% in three hours. While the user acknowledges this could be a (strange) bug, the root of the issue is that their device only lasted three hours.</p><p>It seems as though this problem — the battery drain, specifically — is the result of the May security update.</p><p>More users chimed in about their experiences following the May patch. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/comment/msfmluv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">post states</a> their Pixel 8 Pro only survives for roughly three-and-a-half hours on a full charge. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/comment/msgabw1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report</a> referenced a user's Pixel 7, which also took "a huge hit." While some of these reports concern older Pixel phones, there were a few that brought up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a</a> and even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold after the May update, each suffering shorter power spans.</p><p>What's strange is that these tanked battery issues aren't affecting everyone. Some say Google's recent update has <em>improved </em>their battery lives.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-topsy-turvy-2">A little Topsy-Turvy</h2>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1kn6373/what_happened_to_pixel">What happened to Pixel?😭😂</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones">r/pixel_phones</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Without a clear-cut cause, it's hard to determine what's at fault. However, with some users clearly affected, Google might have to take another look a deliver an update as quickly as possible.</p><p>This isn't the first time Pixel users have suffered problems in recent history, as, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">following the March patch</a>, devices were acting strangely. Users reported brightness fluctuations, audio problems, and vibration issues. The brightness issue seemingly only occurred when users attempted to watch shows or movies via a streaming app like Prime Video. There were band-aid fixes, but those were, as the name implies, temporary.</p><p>Those with Pixels that were affected had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">wait until April</a> before Google patched them. A similar approach might happen again this time for people with these battery problems.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here">rolled out its May patch</a> ten days ago, and its changelog didn't mention any "fixes" for batteries. So, it's not like we can call that out as the culprit of the conflict. What the update did was solve a critical zero-day Android flaw. Elsewhere, Google patched Bluetooth, microphone quality when recording, and Framework issues.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing Phone 3 rumors surface after a couple of database appearances, stating the device could rock Qualcomm's flagship chip, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>The Phone 3 could also see a battery that around 5,000mAh or higher, and with a few upgrades to its telephoto and periscope cameras.</li><li>Nothing's CEO Carl Pei announced this week that the Phone 3 will launch this summer with a price tag around £800 (~$1,062).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Quickly after Nothing built hype over its next flagship, a recent discovery is reportedly highlighting its upgrades.</p><p>Reported by Yogesh Brar at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/the-wait-is-almost-over-exclusive-scoop-on-nothings-flagship-phone-3/">SmartPrix</a>, the Nothing Phone 3 (codename "A024") has reportedly appeared in the GSM database. What's more, the tipster's sources claim that the device will seek to stand firm on flagship grounds by sporting Qualcomm's "flagship snapdragon" SoC. This seemingly points toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which debuted last fall.</p><p>Another internal change is rumored to regard the Phone 3's battery. According to Brar, Nothing could pack a 5,000mAh or higher battery inside its upcoming flagship.</p><p>The post concludes with an external rumor, suggesting the device could see a "versatile" triple camera system. The primary sensor is expected to be "large," but no other details were stated. However, the most notable upgrade could hit the phone's periscope and telephoto lenses.</p><p>Again, nothing more was stated about how high we should set our bar. Brar adds that the device also suddenly appeared in the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database. This is pushing speculation to believe the device is right around the corner, which lines up with what Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the tipster likens the Phone 3 rumored battery increase to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>. Both devices sport an exact 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast charging. What's worth remembering here is that these devices walk the affordable line. It's a truly decent battery size, but rumors suggest the flagship Phone 3 could expand on this. It makes sense, given how Nothing's been hyping it up.</p><p>Moreover, the Phone 3a Pro features a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP Sony LTY-600 periscope lens (with an 8MP ultrawide). These could be the specs we're looking at once the Phone 3 is revealed, but we'll have to wait to know more.</p><p>Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-summer-price-confirmed">announcement</a> earlier this week confirmed the Phone 3's launch for 2025, and stated it would happen this summer. It's CEO, Carl Pei, stated the device would pack Android OS with its upgraded features and security parameters once it arrives. Additionally, Pei stated Nothing was going "all in" with the Phone 3 to make it a true flagship.</p><p>With that, the teaser stopped, but not before Pei stated the device would cost somewhere around £800 (~$1,062). News about the phone's arrival is welcome, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">Nothing delayed it in 2024</a> for the sake of AI.</p>

Garmin only discounted it $25 during Black Friday and kept it full price otherwise. To see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DC6ZD31R"><strong>Fenix 8 at $799 and up, or $200 off</strong></a>, is truly a rare opportunity and an all-time low.</p><p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/amazon-quietly-drops-huge-sale-on-garmin-smartwatches-here-are-the-5-deals-that-matter"><strong>excellent Memorial Day Garmin deals</strong></a> on Venu, Forerunner, Instinct, and Lily models, the Fenix 8 is still <em>quite</em> expensive at this deal price. But my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8 review</a> breaks down how it takes all of the best features from Garmin's running, lifestyle, and battery watches and squeezes them into one epic package.</p><p>All of the Fenix 8 AMOLED models (43mm, 47mm, and 51mm) are $200 off, but many of them are starting to sell out on Amazon. I'd either move quickly or look at other retailers like Best Buy and REI, which have the same deal pricing.</p>

The Garmin Fenix 8 makes a serious case for it, and at $200 off for Memorial Day, it's a slightly easier decision.</p><p>Depending on the model, the Fenix 8 AMOLED has up to 29 days of battery life or 62 multi-band GPS hours, crushing the competition. It has built-in city, trail, golf, and ski maps so you can navigate without pre-downloading a course, and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling and an offline assistant for commands like "Start a Trail Run workout."</p><p>It's dive-certified with 10ATM resistance to handle extreme water sports, with a built-in flashlight for nighttime runs to signal your presence to cyclists. And it has the full range of Garmin software that the company price-locks from cheaper watches.</p><p><strong>Other sites: </strong><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/245469/garmin-fenix-8-amoled-sapphire?sku=2454690005" data-dimension112="8d1f632a-2a7e-4bf2-8866-8d2a4997edcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension48="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension25="$799">REI - $899</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-fenix-8-amoled-sapphire-gps-smartwatch-43mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-soft-gold/6594300.p?skuId=6594300">Best Buy - $899</a> | <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228429/pn/010-02904-20/">Garmin - $899</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DC6ZD321" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8d1f632a-2a7e-4bf2-8866-8d2a4997edcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension48="Other sites: REI - $899" data-dimension25="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The cheaper models use stainless steel, but you can pay $100 extra for a lighter titanium case and sapphire crystal. You can also choose the Fenix 8 Solar for months of sunlight-boosted battery life, but we recommend the AMOLED for the best visuals.</p><p>The Fenix E is even more affordable at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DD5RD79L"><strong>$599 ($200 off)</strong></a>, but be warned that this model cuts most of the core features like the flashlight, mic & speaker, new gen5 HR sensor with ECG and skin temperature, multi-band GPS, and diving protection.</p>

<p>Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, the Fenix 8 has no equal, and we're not likely to see a Fenix 9 for years. And since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">Garmin watch prices are going up</a> to combat tariffs, the Fenix 8 at this price is a rare commodity.</p><p>Case in point, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a> costs $749, and while we're excited to test it out, the Fenix 8 at $799 barely costs more while giving you much better battery life and a more durable design.</p><p>It can be hard to recommend the Fenix 8 at full price, but thanks to Memorial Day, it's fallen into more reasonable territory, in the same range as the $799 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> or $650 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. So if you've been biding your time waiting for the right Garmin watch, and you have some money to spare, now's the time to snag a Fenix 8 before it's $1,000+ again!</p><p>Otherwise, I'll point you back to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/amazon-quietly-drops-huge-sale-on-garmin-smartwatches-here-are-the-5-deals-that-matter">Memorial Day Garmin deal guide</a>, including $100 off the excellent Venu 3 or Forerunner 965 and $50 off the affordable Forerunner 165 and Lily 2.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify announces its AI DJ is now capable of taking vocal song requests on mobile for Premium users.</li><li>Users can press-and-hold its icon to speak a request that includes/combines various music aspects like genre, mood, artist, or songs for an activity.</li><li>Spotify says this is rolling out for users in more than 60 countries today (May 16).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify is busy rolling out an update for its AI DJ that lets users unlock more of its potential for a real-time discovery experience.</p><p>In a press release, Spotify stated it's making good on a user-requested feature by adding more interactions with its AI DJ. For English Premium users in over 60 countries, Spotify says users can control the DJ with their voices for increased personalization. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-13/dj-voice-requests/">follow-up post</a>, the platform states users can "update their personalized sessions" by telling the DJ what they want to hear, rather than letting it go on its own.</p><p>To get this started, Spotify Premium users can search for the DJ and hit play.  When you want to change up the DJ's style, Spotify states you will need to press and hold its icon on the bottom right of your phone. This activates the ability for users to fine-tune the DJ to their preference. Users can tell the DJ to play a specific artist, genre, mood, or music to help them get through an activity, like running.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify says its DJ can understand requests about these areas in combination. The post gives the following example: "Give me some electronic beats for a midday run.”</p><p>Spotify's DJ still pulls from your listening history and preferences to guess what you'd enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-2">Requesting...</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pp9bCfR7mCPrY9b7k5ot9R" name="spotify-dj-song-request-example" alt="Users can search for Spotify's AI DJ and press and hold its icon to deliver a description of what they'd like to hear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pp9bCfR7mCPrY9b7k5ot9R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the DJ's press-and-hold option is rolling out, Spotify reminds users that you still retain the "skip" function, which encourages the AI to rethink its vibe.</p><p>The AI DJ's song request feature is arriving slowly to users beginning today (May 16); however, Spotify warns that it's still in beta. The DJ could get things wrong or even give you a podcast instead of a song.</p><p>We've had Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">AI DJ for two years now</a>, after it debuted with OpenAI technology alongside the platform's music experts. The feature has remained consistent, leveraging users' listening history and genre preferences to understand and produce songs that they know. The DJ has also continued to suggest songs that users may like, using all of their history as a base.</p><p>Sometimes it gets things wrong, and that's where the skip button comes into play.</p><p>At its core, the DJ's purpose was to facilitate easier, quicker real-time curation of music. With the inclusion of voice descriptions for users, the process speeds up, while also becoming a little more specific based on your tastes.</p>

<p>I've always been intrigued by the idea of going back to the days when I didn't need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> and could just rely on my phone or laptop for everything. Unintentionally, I performed this little experiment after my smartwatch ran out of juice and I couldn't find the charging cable.</p><p>Side note: that's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">different issue</a> entirely, and one that we've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-rabbit-just-ate-my-pixel-watch-charging-cord-and-now-im-screwed">written about</a> numerous times.</p><p>I really didn't intend for this experiment to take place; I just couldn't find the right cable at the end of the day, and just wanted to go to bed. Then, I woke up the next morning and didn't even think about the fact that I wasn't wearing a watch — at least at first. It wasn't until the day progressed that I opened my phone to find quite a few missed notifications.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa" name="Tangled-chargers.jpeg" alt="Charging cables for the Apple Watch, Amazfit Band 7, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTS 2, COROS APEX 2, and Garmin Forerunner 955." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vK9MH3VxuccFPa6VrwzRa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of trying to find the charging cable, I got sidetracked by something else, which happens more often than I'd like to admit. Fast forward to today, and it's been 10 days since my smartwatch served its most recent notification.</p><p>When the idea about going smartwatch-less first struck, I didn't think I'd be able to go for more than a day before needing to put it back on. At the same time, I was kind of hoping that not having my wrist constantly buzz at me all day and night would give me some type of peace and quiet.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's been quite the opposite.</p>

<p>The annoyance of nonstop notifications has been replaced with dread and anxiety about what I might have missed. Not so much with things like the trivial notifications that I get throughout the day, but more so with messages from my wife, work, and one app that lets me know when my son is waking up from a nap.</p><p>Yes, all of those notifications still come through and buzz my phone, but I don't always have my phone in my pocket. Most of the time, it's sitting on my desk, with a million other devices that are buzzing or beeping as they vie for my attention. This could have also been partially remedied by using something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-link-is-looking-more-like-windows-answer-to-apples-airdrop">Phone Link</a>, but due to ongoing issues with my desktop computer, it's not currently set up.</p>

<p>A lot of notifications are like junk mail that just get swiped away or ignored. However, I've come across a couple of times when an important message would buzz me, only to get buried by subsequent "junk" notifications.</p><p>Or, I would just be in the middle of working on something, only to see that my wife is calling me because she needs an answer to something, and I wasn't responding.

<p>There is one aspect of wearing a smartwatch that I miss, and it's being able to do things from my wrist. Sometimes that's just sending a quick reply to a message, but it's mostly controlling various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">smart home</a> accessories.</p><p>I've mentioned this before, but it's rather difficult trying to turn off smart lights when you have an infant in your arms. Compounding this issue is trying to do that without just using my voice, as it's deep enough that my son will wake up from the deepest slumber. That alone is kind of crazy to think about, but that's not a topic for here.</p>

<p>The other side of everything is that I've gone 10 days without tracking my sleep or being notified if my heart rate is too high. Those matter more to me than tracking steps or workouts because, well, I don't work out unless you count chasing a little one around.</p><p>The former is because knowing how long I slept provides direct correlation for why I might be feeling like crap. So if I get five or more hours of sleep (which is better than normal) and wake up feeling off, it's an indication that I should probably keep an eye on how I'm feeling throughout the day. The latter is due to my having high blood pressure, and I don't always pay close enough attention to know when to take a break from something to get up and walk around.</p><p>(<em>Editor's note: Keep in mind that while these metrics are helpful, your smartwatch cannot diagnose health conditions and</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch"><em> should always consult your doctor</em></a><em> if you are concerned with any readings from your smartwatch.</em>)</p>

<p>It's weird and honestly a little unsettling to look in the app on my phone and see absolutely no data populated. But that's mostly thanks to how long it's been since I've gone this long without some type of smartwatch or fitness tracker on my wrist.</p><p>If it weren't for my issues revolving around notifications, I would probably just pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> and wear a "traditional" watch when the occasion arose. As it turns out, that's just not something that's viable for me currently, so if you'll excuse me, I need to figure out where I put that dang charger.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-57">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xiaomi is stepping up big with its own chip, the XRING 01, aiming to build more phone tech in-house and stay ahead of the pack.</li><li>CEO Lei Jun revealed the chip’s name on Weibo, with a launch expected before May wraps up.</li><li>The XRING 01 is said to be built on TSMC’s 4nm tech, the same as the top dogs Qualcomm and MediaTek use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is rolling out its own smartphone chip called the XRING 01, signaling the company's growing intention to build more of its phone tech from the ground up and pushing hard to stay ahead of the race.</p><p>The company's co-founder, Lei Jun, took to Weibo to drop the name of Xiaomi's first in-house smartphone chip. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/chinas-xiaomi-launch-self-developed-mobile-chip-late-may-2025-05-15/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, he also confirmed the chip will make its debut in a device before the end of May.</p><p>Breaking from the usual playbook, Xiaomi’s XRING 01 chip is reportedly built on TSMC’s 4nm tech, the same stuff powering today’s top-tier chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek.</p>
<h2 id="beastly-cpu-setup-2">Beastly CPU setup</h2>
<p>Under the hood, it’s said to rock an octa-core setup in a 1+3+4 layout: a Cortex-X925 core at 3.2GHz, three Cortex-A725s running at 2.6GHz, and four Cortex-A520s cruising at 2.0GHz.</p><p>As per industry tipster Digital Chat Station, Xiaomi’s in-house chip is blowing past expectations. Early benchmarks are looking solid, and if the hype holds up, it might even edge out the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in raw performance.</p><p>Wary of possible U.S. sanctions, Xiaomi has set up a 1,000-strong task force led by ex-Qualcomm exec Qin Muyun, who came on board back in 2021. The team’s mission is to build out the XRING 01, Xiaomi’s custom application processor, which first popped up as a prototype earlier this year.</p><p>Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-chip-platform-department-creation-report">has an in-house team that’s been quietly grinding away on custom chips</a> for a while now. The team works to make sure the processors and other key parts are dialed in for Xiaomi’s phones.</p>
<h2 id="xiaomi-15s-pro-likely-first-to-get-it-2">Xiaomi 15S Pro likely first to get it</h2>
<p>Rumor has it that the Xiaomi 15S Pro will be the first to pack the new XRING 01 chip under the hood. Since the 15 and 15 Ultra are already out in the wild, the 15S lineup looks like Xiaomi’s clever move to spice up the lineup halfway through the cycle.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the XRING 01 isn’t Xiaomi’s first shot at custom chips. Back in 2017, it rolled out the Surge S1 for the Mi 5C. The company even started cooking up the Surge S2 after that but decided to hit pause on its in-house chip plans—until now.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-62">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube is rolling out a fresh way to vote songs up or down in shared playlists.</li><li>Once invited, your crew can thumbs up tracks, pushing favorites to the front.</li><li>You control who gets to vote—open it up to everyone, keep it exclusive to collaborators, or switch voting off.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube has unveiled a fresh feature for collaborative playlists that lets you give songs a thumbs up or down to show what’s hitting or missing.</p><p>This new feature could make road trips and kickbacks way more fun. According to a post on X, YouTube is turning on playlist voting, letting everyone have a say (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-collaborative-playlist-voting-added/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). It's slowly rolling out in phases.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 We’re introducing even more updates to playlists! Now we’re gradually rolling out voting on playlistsYou can try this out yourself by voting for your favorite song on this playlist we made from Kendrick Lamar & SZA’s “The Grand National” Tour setlist: https://t.co/JEoSoEfoxX https://t.co/gCES0MxQfS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1922756235037667431">May 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube</a> has had shared playlists for a while now, where multiple people can add songs and build one big mix together. It’s perfect for parties, hangouts, or anytime you want a group vibe.</p><p>Now, YouTube is letting friends or family in a shared playlist vote on songs. If you’re invited, you can jump into the app and give tracks a thumbs up or thumbs down. Songs with more love move up in the queue, so the crowd favorites play first.</p><p>YouTube has posted a Shorts video showing you how to let your squad vote on tracks.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up-2">How to set it up</h2>
<p>If you want to try it out, just start by making a new playlist and set it to “unlisted” or “public.” Then flip on the “collaborate” option, hit the share icon, copy the link, and send it to whoever you want to join in.</p><p>When it comes to voting control, you can open it up to ‘Everyone’ with a YouTube account, shut voting off completely, or let only invited collaborators cast their votes.</p><p>Like with any group-driven feature, there are some hiccups to keep in mind. It’s awesome for getting everyone pumped before a road trip or hangout, but if people don’t actually vote, you might still be stuck picking songs yourself.</p><p>Also, make sure you load up on a good variety of tracks early on. Otherwise, the playlist can get a bit messy before the voting sorts things out.</p>

It's easy to see why manufacturers are rushing to use these batteries in their phones; switching to silicon provides better energy density — allowing brands to squeeze in bigger batteries — alongside increased durability, and it holds up much better in cold weather.</p>

<p>That's why the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> have considerably bigger batteries than their predecessors without adding too much bulk or weight. These batteries still use a lithium cathode, but the anode sees a mixture of silicon-carbon alongside the usual graphite, and this results in greater density.</p><p>Group14 is at the front lines of this push, with the brand's SCC55 silicon-carbon composite used widely in the industry — Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">Magic 7 Pro uses the custom material</a> in its battery, for example. Group14 is now partnering with German industrial giant BASF to deliver a "drop-in-ready solution" that predominantly uses silicon-dominant anodes.</p><p>Group14 says this move has the potential to unlock a whole host of new use cases, and I talked to the brand's VP of Global Market Strategy, Grant Ray, to get a better understanding of the tech. "The collaboration with BASF is about working with a leading global partner to develop drop-in solutions that shift the way we think about battery performance."</p><p>"BASF is coming up with interesting technologies, and we've been working closely together create a turnkey product that radically reduces reformulation times when manufacturers are considering how they'll do line development to make these batteries. The goal is to cut down on the time it takes to get to market and see the benefit of silicon batteries," said Ray.</p><p>At a high-level overview, Group14 is combining its SCC55 silicon-carbon material with BASF's Licity 2698 X F binder — a custom polymer made of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) with high stress-strain and elasticity that's designed for silicon-rich anodes. Ray noted that this collaboration makes it much easier for a battery manufacturer to make the switch to silicon-rich batteries. "It allows smaller battery manufacturers that may not have sophisticated capabilities for how they play with their chemistries to start to move a lot quicker in making the transition to silicon."</p>

<p>This is important, because the current generation of silicon carbon batteries used in phones have just 10% silicon in their anode. While silicon has greater energy density of 4200mAh/g — graphite has 372mAh/g — it expands considerably during charging and discharging. Mixing silicon with carbon — as Group14 is doing with SCC55 — increases the material's mechanical integrity while providing better conductivity.</p><p>Ray said the next iteration of batteries will see a greater mixture of silicon-carbon in the anode, with work underway on "full displacement" — completely switching to a silicon-carbon anode. Ray talked about two challenges to getting to that point. "One is the amount of time it takes, and the sophistication that battery vendors have when it comes to dialing in on the best cathode material, the best binder, the best housing, and reformulating their lines effectively."</p><p>The second limitation is availability; Ray says that the demand for the SCC55 material is significantly higher than supply, and the manufacturer is aiming to get its U.S. plant online in 2026 to cater to ever-increasing global demand. The current situation with tariffs is another hurdle that's leading to plenty of uncertainty, but Ray notes that Group14 is pushing ahead with its plans.</p><p>The brand has another plant in South Korea in a joint collaboration with SK, and this dual sourcing strategy allows it to deliver silicon batteries at a greater pace — Ray likened it to being a "local provider at a global scale. For us, the way that we get to our customers the fastest is we go to them from as close as possible. We're growing as fast as we possibly can, but the fact is that even this is still a drop in the bucket in the global demand for energy."</p>

<p>While full displacement is still some time away, the advances in mixing higher ratios of silicon-carbon anode should deliver batteries with significantly greater density. "You're going to start seeing a much higher percentages of silicon in the batteries as we look to how silicon batteries develop in products over the coming couple of cycles."</p><p>This is like a push-pull effect, said Ray, where the phone manufacturers are pushing battery vendors to deliver increasing gains. "We also work directly with the OEMs so that they have a much better understanding of the real benefits of being able to do a full displacement, and they can push those battery manufacturers to go faster, because otherwise we're going to incremental increases."</p><p>It's not unfathomable to think next-gen phones featuring 10,000mAh batteries in roughly the same size as today's devices, and Ray said that phone manufacturers are not as risk-averse to trying out increasing silicon mixtures. While this tech is being pioneered by Chinese brands, Ray says we may see bigger brands like Samsung switch to silicon-carbon batteries in the near future — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> is touted to feature the battery next year.</p><p>Using flagships this year made me realize the potential of silicon-carbon batteries, and I'm excited to see how this tech evolves in 2026 and beyond. Most phones these days last at least a day and a half between charges, and I can't wait until the time comes when we'll only need to charge our phones twice or thrice a week.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Redmagic is best-known for its range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a>, and the brand is venturing into accessories with the Dao series. The latest addition is the 3-in-1 Go Power Bank, which includes a 5,000mAh battery in a travel-friendly design and a built-in USB-C cable. What's interesting is that the power bank has an integrated blade plug, transforming it into a 65W GaN charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="45fCTnuxPE6xn25FS3wRCG" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45fCTnuxPE6xn25FS3wRCG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The versatility makes it a decent option if you're looking at a travel-ready power bank that can also be used as a charger, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/nubia-RedMagic-Charger-5000mAh-Foldable/dp/B0DM8FYCYG">coming in at $59 on Amazon</a>, it is on the costlier side as these things go — you're basically paying for the convenience. Now, Redmagic calls this a 3-in-1 device, but that is disingenuous; think of it as a GaN charger with an integrated 20W power bank — the third use case is just the built-in cable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvxzMoCE2Qy5mzLaBGwC6G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvxzMoCE2Qy5mzLaBGwC6G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like its phones, Redmagic went with futuristic styling, and the power bank looks quite distinctive. The silver color scheme looks great, and the blocky design makes it easy to use. The included USB-C cable has a braided design and charges at 20W when using the internal power bank, and 60W when plugged in to a wall socket and using the GaN charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fCN73QVghAbeik8YbJTh5G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCN73QVghAbeik8YbJTh5G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with the power bank side of things. The 5,000mAh size isn't adequate to fully charge your phone; in real-world use, you'll get around 2,700mAh of usable power out of this thing, and that's decent — all power banks have a similar efficiency. While it may not charge your phone to 100%, it is quite good at bringing it up to 60% if it's low on charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qRLuMQvo4MPVFfQXYsCswF" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRLuMQvo4MPVFfQXYsCswF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a tiny LCD panel that shows remaining battery level, and it ties into the design very well. I've had the power bank for just under two months now, and I didn't have any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei/huawei-mate-xt-camera-review">Huawei Mate XT</a>.</p>

<p>The internal battery of the power bank charges at 20W, and it takes just over 90 minutes to charge. While there are plenty of other choices if you just need a 5,000mAh power bank — I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/baseus-picogo-thinnest-magnetic-power-bank">Baseus' PicoGo magnetic products</a> — the main reason to consider the Go Power Bank is the 65W GaN charging. There's a single USB-C port at the back, and it relies on the USB PD protocol to deliver 65W of power to connected devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UFnK2gjJ8NRQgBCwL6AZ9G" name="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank" alt="Redmagic Dao Go Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFnK2gjJ8NRQgBCwL6AZ9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can use USB-C out and the built-in USB-C cable to charge two devices at once, with the total power budget at 65W (45W + 20W). The GaN charging makes the Go Power Bank a great choice while traveling, and while the design may not be to everyone's tastes — it has a distinct gamer aesthetic — there are no problems with usability.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung rumors suggest the company is interested in upgrading the selfie camera of its Galaxy S25 FE.</li><li>The device could sport a 12MP selfie camera, which is suspected to deliver "better quality" photos, as it has been stuck with 10MP for a few generations.</li><li>Older rumors claim the S25 FE could launch in the "second half" of 2025 with MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 powerhouse.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's another member of the Galaxy S25 era that we're waiting for, and this new rumor states it might come with an upgrade.</p><p>Rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25-fe/">Galaxy Club</a> (Dutch) suggest Samsung could bring a long-awaited upgrade to its expected Galaxy S25 FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-fe-gets-an-upgraded-selfie-camera-after-two-years/">SamMobile</a>). The "FE" part of this series stands for "Fan Edition," and things are kept pretty tame compared to Samsung's flagships. However, the publication's sources suggest the S25 FE will upgrade its selfie camera to 12MP.</p><p>With that, the safest piece of speculation is that consumers will be able to take "better selfies," as the post also notes.</p><p>Additionally, this rumor seemingly places the Galaxy S25 FE's selfie camera on the same level as its flagship counterparts. However, the publication is hesitant to speak on its true quality because, remember, FE is more budget-oriented.</p>

Looking at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-cameras">our review of the base S25's</a>, there's not really much to write home about. The device's front camera does its job, offering a decent selfie experience, but it's nothing major. If the Galaxy S25 FE is to follow this trail, perhaps we already know what we're in for. However, the upgrade is nice, considering Samsung hasn't improved its FE's selfie camera for a couple of generations.</p><p>On the other hand, we're still unclear about its rear camera system. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">S24 FE</a> features a triple array with a 50MP primary, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. There's always hope for some improvement here, maybe with its telephoto, but don't hold your breath about it. Samsung typically keeps these things the same for a while before changing.</p><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s25-fe-might-pack-a-pleasant-hardware-twist">rumors claim</a> Samsung could hunt down MediaTek for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC for the S25 FE. Supposedly, the Korean OEM had originally wanted its in-house Ecynos chip inside, but sudden production issues have forced it into an alternative. MediaTek's chip is strong; however, and is the company's answer to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Rumors claim Samsung could launch the Galaxy S25 FE in the "second half" of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly switching gears, and chasing a different type of battery material known as "SUS CAN."</li><li>This material is designed to increase battery capacity, meaning future phones, like the Galaxy S26, could have "significantly" bigger capacities.</li><li>Old rumors claimed Samsung would chase silicon-carbon batteries; however, any upgrade would be nice as we've been stuck in 2019 with the same old, same old.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New information has allegedly come to light about Samsung's upgraded battery tech in its next wave of Galaxy phones.</p><p>The latest report arrives courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/tN3xAqF6Sg">The Elec</a> (Korean), which claims Samsung might've changed its mind about its (hopeful) battery tech upgrade (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1922928235974885882">Jukanlosreve</a>). This isn't "bad," technically, as the report says Samsung might look toward a different material, known as "SUS CAN." As the post notes, the purpose of this material swap is to finally provide stronger, longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>The tipster highlights the change could facilitate a "significant increase in battery capacity."</p><p>The publication's sources allege the SUS CAN is a "stainless steel" material that's currently in development by Samsung SDI. It's also worth mentioning that this same tech is inside Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max. This material change has two key focuses: boost energy density and improve Galaxy's charging speeds. Both of these areas would be welcome upgrades for Samsung's Galaxy phone line, which has become pretty stagnant.</p><p>More importantly, there's a chance we could see this battery tech arrive on the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p>
<h2 id="any-battery-upgrade-is-welcome-2">Any battery upgrade is welcome</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Korean media reports that Samsung plans to adopt a new technology in its next-generation model that could significantly increase battery capacity.According to the report, the technology involves a stainless steel material being developed by Samsung SDI, commonly referred to in…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1922928235974885882">May 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Additionally, sources claim SUS CAN could also reduce battery swelling. Speaking plainly, this would, ideally, increase the longevity of the battery, as one that swells is a telltale sign that it's time to chuck it.</p><p>Rumors that Samsung's future batteries could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">finally catch up to the competition</a> started earlier in February. That report came from FNNews (Korean), which alleged Samsung was chasing silicon-carbon batteries. We've seen this tech in a few places, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">like Honor's Magic 7 Pro</a>, which provides better durability and faster charging. Like the current rumors, those from February stated we may see this tech in "future Galaxy phones."</p><p>There's also speculation that Samsung's batteries could debut anywhere from 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh. There's nothing concrete about what sort of charging speeds Samsung could strive for, but hey, we can dream of something more than 45W.</p><p>If 45W grinds your gears, it's because Samsung has provided that same charging strength on its Ultra model for the past three generations. Essentially, we're all still vibing back in 2019. Samsung did work in a little magic with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> battery, bringing slightly faster charging, but it's clearly not cutting it.</p>

<p>Essential Space is a new software feature Nothing introduced on the Phone 3a series that collects notes, screenshots, photos, and voice memos of your choosing. Then, it uses AI to summarize and analyze the information provided, creating action items. For example, if you upload a coupon to Essential Space, you might get a smartphone reminder to use it before it's about to expire.</p><p>For the most part, you interact with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">Essential Space</a> using the Essential Key — the shiny dedicated button on the right side of your Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro.</p>

<p>You can capture and save screenshots to Essential Space in seconds using the Essential Key. It's easier than using the standard Android shortcut, since you only need to press one button instead of two. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. Quickly <strong>click the Essential Key</strong> to take a screenshot.</p><p>2. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your screenshot and any notes to Essential Space.</p>

<p>In a post-launch OTA update, Nothing added the ability to capture photos with the Essential Key, which are saved to the Essential Space. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Camera app</strong>.</p><p>2. <strong>Quickly press the Essential Key</strong> to snap a photo.</p><p>3. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your photo and any notes to Essential Space.</p>

<p>Essential Space might be best viewed as a combination of a few different app ideas, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and Pixel Recorder.

<p>1. <strong>Long-press the Essential Key </strong>to start a voice recording.</p><p>2.<strong> Keep the Essential Key pressed </strong>to continue recording,</p><p>3. <strong>Let go of the Essential Key</strong> to stop and save the recording.</p>

<p>Every smartphone brand is trying to pave its own path with AI, and Nothing's version of that is the Essential Space. It can't replace your notes app, but it can be a better way of organizing your photos, screenshots, and voice recordings than having them scattered across multiple apps.</p><p>Plus, Nothing has already expressed willingness to update and grow Essential Space's feature set, so it could improve further over time. It's a key benefit of purchasing a Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro, especially in the U.S., where cellular support is otherwise limited.</p>

<hr>
<p>Sony's latest wireless headphones are here, and they've arrived with a mechanism that makes their transportation a whole lot easier.</p><p>In a press release (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-introduces-the-best-noise-cancellation-with-the-wh-1000xm6-headphones-302456593.html">PR Newswire</a>), Sony highlighted the launch of its WH-1000XM6 headphones. The company mentions a few key aspects about the device, most notably its "premium sound." According to Sony, its latest headphones were created alongside the music industry's top recording studios, like Sterling Sound, Battery Studios, and Coast Mastering.</p><p>Regarding the device, Randy Merrill, mastering engineer from Sterling Sound, said the headphones "transport me to a different world with their excellent bass, frequency response, soundstage and detail and truthfully represent the sounds of the recordings that we work so hard to make."</p><p>Internally, the headphones are powered by Sony's HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3. The processor is said to achieve speeds that are "seven times faster" than its previous edition. Moreover, the WH-1000XM6 features 12 microphones (not a typo). Sony says this helps bring about a leap in noise-cancelling performance, as each mic adjusts your device for more immersive listening in noisy scenarios.</p><p>The headphone's Auto Ambient Sound mode will adjust your audio to the sound around you, so you don't miss a beat. Sony says you can use its Sound Connect app to adjust these settings manually or let the headphones do it themselves.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1657px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XX7R3USgnnA8Dn7Z33o9yD" name="sony-wh-1000xm6-noise-cancelling-on-a-table" alt="A pair of Sony's newest headphones in white sitting on in a music studio against a soundboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XX7R3USgnnA8Dn7Z33o9yD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1657" height="932" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to Sony's design, the WH-1000XM6 feature a folding mechanism, which the post states its "durable." The fold makes the headphones a little smaller and more manageable inside bags or airplane pocket, per Sony. Consumers can also find these headphones with a new compact case with a magnetic lock.</p><p>The headphones themselves feature an "elegant, soft fit wider headband featuring synthetic leather ensuring a pressure-free fit." Sony highlights the ear cups, stating they have been outfitted with a stretchable material that shouldn't give consumers too much fatigue over long periods of use.</p><p>Additionally, there is a responsive touch panel and controls that let users quickly swap between the following modes: noise cancellation, ambient sound, and mute mic.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vQbtWeXSc4Wj5VD7nMcSsA" name="sony-wh-1000xm6-noise-cancelling-post-malone" alt="Post Malone stands against a forest green background wearing Sony's latest headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQbtWeXSc4Wj5VD7nMcSsA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1394" height="784" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sony says its usage of "high rigidity carbon fiber composite material" and a new voice coil helps to bring out every note in your music. The post states voices should be clearer with more defined instrumentals. The headphones even support Edge-AI, which is said to return the full potential of sound that could've been lost during compression.</p><p>Feature-wise, the WH-1000XM6 delivers Quick Access and Scene-based Listening. Each can connect to your Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music account.</p><p>The noise-cancelling headphones let users continue with their tunes even when plugged in (USB) for a charge. However, the headphones are said to last "up to" 30 hours on a full charge with their noise cancellation active. Sony states users can get roughly three hours of power in just three minutes.</p><p>As the WH-1000XM6 headphones launch today (May 15), Sony says you might see its ad campaign with the GRAMMY Award-nominated Post Malone. The artist states, "These new noise-cancelling headphones make you feel completely inside the music."</p><p>Sony's newest headphones are available in black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue for $449 ($599 CAD). Consumers can look for them on Amazon, Best Buy, or Sony.com and other retailers.</p>

<p>As detective games, Shattered and Ghost Town couldn't be more different. In one, you play a paranormal detective with the power to seal away ghosts that can't seem to let go of this world. In the other, you're stuck in a mysterious mental facility, slowly losing your mind as you try to unravel the mystery of what brought you there.</p><p>Ghost Town is a fully immersive VR game made by the folks behind The Room VR, one of the most critically acclaimed games on the Meta Quest platform. Meanwhile, Shattered takes full advantage of the mixed reality capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, transforming your room into an interactive space that morphs along with the story.</p><p>Both games tell an incredible story that'll have you wondering what's next, not wanting to take the headset off until the mysteries have finally been solved. I haven't been this enamored with a detective game since that first Phoenix Wright release on the Nintendo DS eons ago. It's been incredible to don the detective hat once again and give myself a little taste of what being a modern-day Sherlock Holmes might feel like.</p>

<p>You are Edith Penrose, a paranormal detective who is finally getting her act together in life and becoming a success, just as your brother goes missing. But he didn't go missing in any traditional sense of the word. Rather, the event plays out in a haunted theater as the two of you are trying to exorcise the ghost of the show's lead actress, who was inadvertently murdered during opening night by a faulty prop knife.</p><p>The storytelling, animations, and voice acting are beyond what you would typically expect from a VR game. That's not to say that there are no VR games that feature these qualities, quite the opposite, considering titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> exist, but I've come to expect that most VR games will always have a bit of an indie, understated flair to them.</p><p>This level of quality holds true throughout the entirety of the game's experience. The graphics are among the best I've ever seen on the Quest 3 and look more like a PC game, with very few exceptions. The environmental detail is superb, and while not <em>everything</em> in the environments is interactive, the available interactions are all done supremely well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your roommate aglow with light from an ethereal stained glass window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Levers you pull and knobs you turn have a palpable weight to them. The environment feels like it actually exists all around you, even if this is just a fantasy story. The same feeling was also present in the studio's prior work, The Room VR, so while it's not surprising to see it carry over to another game, it still feels like a breath of fresh air in an era when even the biggest name games ship with ridiculously stupid bugs and other design problems.</p><p>Beyond just excellent base mechanics and environmental details, the game's puzzles, story, and settings are all incredibly well thought out and frightfully intriguing. I found myself thinking about the game hours after the end of a play session. It's a feeling I find happens most often with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> because of their unique spatial quality.</p><p>Solving the puzzles felt challenging and rewarding because the developers don't hold your hand, but they do leave enough hints in the area to help you understand what you're supposed to do and where you go next.  This quality is not often present in games, as it is very difficult to design environments so that the player has a general understanding of what they're supposed to do without having floating arrows or deliberate text telling players exactly what to do next.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-01" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing the complex machinery underneath the lighthouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can still request a hint via a cleverly devised notebook system when you get stuck. Hints are found in the pull-out tab on the bottom of the notebook, but these hints don't feel too obvious, and there was never a time when I felt like I needed the developers to directly tell me what to do next.</p><p>Players familiar with The Room series will feel right at home with the puzzles here. While there is generally more narrative attached to the puzzles than some of the ones that series has, the general feel of most puzzles is right in line with what I expect from this developer's pedigree. These aren't obscure, sometimes obtuse puzzles, as I feel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/riven-meta-quest-3-impressions">the Myst series</a> can suffer from. Rather, the puzzles feel in line with the story and the setting, no matter where you are in the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-03" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your apartment building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love how many different locales you'll go through in this game and how many characters you'll talk to, as well. Solving the “puzzle” of how to turn on the stage lights in an antiquated theater is a great example of how practical many of the games' puzzles are versus other titles that might throw you into a world filled with a collection of weird puzzles that don't make any sense in the greater context.</p><p>So far, Ghost Town is my meta quest game of the year. We might only be in May and have plenty to look forward to before the end of the year, but something this high quality only comes along every once in a while. It's a game I highly recommend to all Meta Quest players, especially since there's a free demo you can try before committing to the price.</p>

<p>I've played a ton of incredible mixed reality games since the Meta Quest 3 came out in 2023, but few nail the execution as well as Shattered. Like all mixed reality games, Shattered places virtual objects around the room you're physically standing in. Suddenly, you'll find a new door or window on your wall and, of course, you're immediately compelled to see what's behind it.</p><p>That's when things start to get really trippy. Just like in games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand or Spatial Ops</a>, these windows and doors are portals to another world. The door you just opened might lead to your sister's apartment, or the office you swore you left at 5 o'clock.</p><p>These portals aren't just relegated to windows or doors, though. Sometimes, they're holes in the wall, or maybe a hatch on the floor that you'll have to unlock and peer down through. The first time you open the hatch and look through your physical floor into a completely different room is a thing of true amazement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna" name="shattered-meta-quest-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official mixed reality screenshot of Shattered taken on a Meta Quest 3 showing a memory playing out in a "portal" on a wall" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlaySide Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that portal isn't one you can walk through, only one you can see through. As such, you'll have to use your mind's powers to clone the room's objects by aiming at them and placing them in your physical space. In a way, it's like solving an escape room from the outside-in, and every new room feels fresh in a way that's physically impossible in real life.</p><p>As you make your way through each of the game's case files, which will take you around 4 hours to complete in total, objects will start to pile up in your room. While you can remove these objects when you're done with them, I enjoyed leaving as many as possible to remind myself what I'd solved up until this point.</p><p>The story is told in memory fragments that you'll grab and place around you, assembling each piece in your space like a Hollywood movie. It's an incredible feeling that's unmatched on the platform, and it's a game that simply wouldn't make sense outside of a mixed reality headset.</p>

Scrolled content will "trace the curvature" of the rounded Pixel Watch display for smoother transitions, shrinking or expanding to match the available space.</p><p>They'll be better "responsive feedback" when tapping options, and your watch face theme will affect the colors throughout the UI.</p>

<p>Looks aside, Google promised "more engaging" Tiles with "quick access to information or actions," along with "space-efficient" notification buttons that convey more information. And, of course, Gemini will replace Assistant as your go-to Pixel Watch helper.</p><p>We'll see how much of a true smarts upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can offer on smartwatch hardware. But this update will align Pixel Watches closer with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. And as much as I personally loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Watch 3</a> for focusing so heavily on Fitbit, that route wouldn't work with Google's core audience in the long run.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-app-drawer" alt="The Wear OS 5 app drawer on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked my Android Central colleagues a few weeks back if they preferred stock Wear OS or One UI Watch on Galaxy Watches. It kicked off a fiery debate, and while several of us fell on the Pixel Watch side, our arguments were more about vibes than anything else. The One UI crowd had specifics.</p><p>Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, prefers One UI Watch "because it better mimics the UI on a smartphone," letting you swipe up or down to access apps or quick settings from any screen, or customize those quick settings. Stock Wear OS "feels oddly limited" while One UI Watch "feels more like Android."</p><p>Our contributor Brady Snyder called the Pixel Watch UI "unusable, more like a kid's toy or a Fitbit," saying it doesn't fully commit to either the smartwatch or fitness watch camp. He believes One UI "scales down to a smartwatch form factor" much better, and it displays fitness and health metrics in a more "engaging" way than stock Wear OS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Derrek declaring his side "correct," the debate is still fully subjective. But it's also true that there's a lot of style and feature continuity between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-one-ui-6-watch">One UI 6 Watch</a>, and the rumor is that the next version will bring familiar tools like the Now Bar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Stock Wear OS doesn't really feel like an extension of your Pixel phone software in the same way. Aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">cool watch faces</a>, there isn't much room for customization, as the interface is very minimalist, straightforward, and tailored. That will appeal to some people, but maybe not the core Android audience.</p>

<p>Google has clinical leads focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">heart health accuracy</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-clinical-sleep-lead-has-cool-ideas-for-future-of-smartwatch-sleep-tracking">sleep accuracy</a> to improve its Pixel Watch accuracy, and the last Wear OS update crammed in a bunch of running tools that would appeal to old Fitbit watch fans.</p><p>Most wearable brands are trying to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade accuracy</a> and fitness subscriptions, so it's no surprise that Google would take this route. But it's also true that its old audience loved Fitbits, in part, because they lasted a week per charge and had a simple interface. And many of these fans had iPhones.</p><p>No matter how much smarter Google makes Fitbit, those old fans aren't likely to pivot to a Pixel Watch that's not especially rugged, long-lasting, or affordable.</p><p>(Side note: I'm still annoyed that Google killed off Fitbit watches.)</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 catered to me as a runner; it had genuinely useful AI coaching and decent accuracy. But admittedly, I still prefer Garmin watches for all the reasons you'd expect. Only athletes who need a well-rounded experience would choose Google's 2-day smartwatch over any 7- or 14-day fitness watch.</p><p>Everyday Android users work out as much as anyone, but they were fine with something straightforward like Google Fit. What made people interested in a Pixel Watch was its <em>smarts</em>.</p><p>To Google's credit, it did make an effort with Wear OS 5 to add things like Nest Doorbell footage, Google TV controls, the Recorder app, and offline Google Maps. But it didn't upgrade the notifications, Tiles, or customization tools.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> could keep improving on the fitness front with cycling software, hiking maps in Google Maps, or rep counting at the gym. But that'll just be an important side dish, while the changes above will be the main course in making this watch more relevant for Android fans.</p><p>Google piggybacked on Gemini to sell a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-q3-2024-pixel-9-market-share-growth-report"> record number of Pixel 9s</a> last year, so it's no surprise that it would try to get its new AI on smartwatches as quickly as possible. In theory, Gemini Actions will transform the Wear OS experience by letting the AI do all the work of finding what you need.</p><p>And Material 3 Expressive, launched simultaneously on phones <em>and</em> watches, makes Wear OS 6 feel more like an extension of Android 16 instead of its own thing. I think that's a smart move on Google's part.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 970 and 570 have arrived with a bundle of new features, most notably new health sensors and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling and voice commands. But fair warning: they're also far pricier than the previous generation.</p><p>Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, the Forerunner 570 has a greater emphasis on triathletes with a new Garmin Coach option and custom multisport workouts built in the Connect app.</p><p>Unfortunately, this version still restricts key features to make the 970 more compelling, like offline maps, Hill/ Endurance scores, stamina, Strava Live Segments, and ClimbPro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mic-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 rendered in a black void, angled from the bottom to emphasize the titanium bezel and the screen showing a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRg7gPJWU45C5rK9RAWsnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the premium Forerunner 970, you get four extra days of battery life, sapphire crystal protection with a titanium bezel, ECG readings, and a few new premium running dynamics.</p><p>This model has jumped $150 in price compared to the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>, putting the 970 squarely into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>-lite territory. Garmin said during its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">earnings call</a> that watch price increases were on the table, making this somewhat expected.</p><p>Neither new Forerunner watch offers any kind of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+</a> trial period.</p><p>Below, we'll break down every key change Garmin has highlighted in the Garmin Forerunner 970 and 570, as well as how they compare to their predecessors!</p>
<h2 id="garmin-forerunner-570-key-changes-and-upgrades-2">Garmin Forerunner 570: Key changes and upgrades</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.00%;"><img id="7Qh2JGAwUY2URsLpKrAYtF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-lineup" alt="The six different Garmin Forerunner 570 models in various sizes and colors, arrayed in a line in white space and showing various watch faces and widgets." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Qh2JGAwUY2URsLpKrAYtF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 adds an aluminum bezel, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Vivoactive 6</a>, making it slightly more distinct than the past polymer-only Forerunners. It comes in two sizes: 42mm (42g) with a 1.2-inch display and 47mm (50g) with a 1.4-inch display.</p><p>Both are 0.1-inch display upgrades over the Forerunner 265, which had a thicker display border. The Forerunner 570 is 3g heavier in both sizes, but still much lighter than most smartwatches.</p><p>Garmin also says it has the "brightest AMOLED display on any Garmin smartwatch." While they couldn't share specific nits of brightness, it is "twice as bright" as other AMOLED models, which is a significant jump and will help make them more visible and colorful in direct sunlight.</p><p>Perhaps because of the brighter display and mic/speaker combo, the Forerunner 570 battery falls slightly short of the 265 (11 vs. 13 days), while the multi-band GPS hours are unchanged (14 hours). The Forerunner 265S lasted 15 days or 15 hours, while the smaller 570 42mm only lasts 10 days and 13 hours.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-calling" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 on a woman's wrist at the track, the screen showing her taking a phone call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ULzeL65ChsPtUbaszRSEvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the built-in mic and speaker, the Forerunner 570 will support Bluetooth calling, passthrough commands to your phone's Siri or Gemini, or on-watch commands. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-EECCAC99-90D6-4AB1-9A3A-EC433D3365E2/EN-US/GUID-5AA3DA43-FF89-4889-B897-CEF0A7E221C7.html">Fenix 8 owner's manual</a> lists out the kind of commands you can use, like starting a timer, changing music volume, or starting a workout.</p><p>You'll also get skin temperature changes in the Connect app, paired with your HRV score to help Garmin judge your sleep quality, recovery, and heat acclimation, while warning you of potential illness. You don't get ECG readings, however.</p><p>Garmin has confirmed that the Forerunner 570 and 970 both have the newest Elevate gen5 heart rate sensor, matching the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. Since other 2025 watches like the Instinct 3 and Vivoactive 6 stuck to last-gen sensors, this is a gratifying upgrade that'll keep serious runners happy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-press-photo" alt="Several Garmin Forerunner 570 watches rendered in a black void, splayed along the left edge to create a slow-motion falling effect." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Otherwise, all of the new Forerunner 570 features relate to software, starting with Evening Report. A complement to Morning Report, this version will remind you how much sleep you need, show your upcoming alarm, and list out tomorrow's weather forecast, calendar events, and suggested workout.</p><p>Garmin Triathlon Coach joins the Run, Swim, and Strength Coach options. All these training plans auto-update based on your current performance and fatigue levels, but the newest Coach will include Swim workouts, Two-a-Days, Brick workouts, and optional Strength training.</p><p>If you're following a course, Garmin will trigger the auto-lap mile times when you cross the course markers, rather than when your GPS <em>says</em> you've run a mile. And if you forget to stop your workout at the finish line, Garmin will "suggest trimming data" to match the course. Basically, Garmin will reward people who download GPX data beforehand with common-sense edits.</p><p>Lastly, the Forerunner 570 adds a dozen or so golfing features like yardage to green and a digital scorecard, plus a few new sports modes like Duathlon, Obstacle Racing, Hunting, and Fishing. The 570 ships in Slate Grey, Indigo, Amp Yellow, Cloud Blue, and Raspberry, and is available to order on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1464001/">Garmin's site</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-lineup" alt="The three Garmin Forerunner 970 models rendered in white space in a line, showing a watch face, Running Economy widget, and a map view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Garmin Forerunner 970 has a dozen or so price-locked software tools over the Forerunner 570, most notably preloaded road, trail, ski, and golf maps with 4X the storage. Just like with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a>, it's pretty disappointing that a $549 watch doesn't have offline maps, forcing you to spend $749 to get them!</p><p>The Forerunner 970 also has exclusive access to Strava and Garmin Live Segments, real-time stamina, Hill & Endurance Scores, Group LiveTrack, Trendline popularity routing, advanced cycling dynamics with grit and flow, and ClimbPro.</p><p>What's new compared to the Forerunner 965? The built-in LED flashlight, mic & speaker, sapphire crystal display protection, and support for the ECG app and skin temperature readings give the Forerunner 970 most of the $1,100 Fenix 8's headliner features, which is how you could convince yourself that $749 is actually a fair price.</p><p>I'd also hoped to see cellular support on the Forerunner 970, given the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/garmin-fenix-8-could-get-a-massive-upgrade-in-the-form-of-lte">Fenix 8 LTE leak</a>. Unfortunately, you'll still need your phone on hand for phone calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-preloaded-maps" alt="Render of the Garmin Forerunner 970 in a black void, the image focused on turn-by-turn navigation on a city-streets map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 970 lasts 15 days or 21 multi-band GPS hours, while the Forerunner 265 lasted 23 days but only 19 multi-band GPS hours. It's 3g heavier than the Forerunner 965, but also 0.3mm thinner. At 56g, it's significantly lighter than a Fenix 8 because only its bezel is titanium, not the entire body.</p><p>While you might resent losing a week of battery life, the Forerunner 970 has the same doubled brightness for enhanced visibility. And the addition of ECGs and skin temp readings, plus the gen5 optical heart rate sensors, will help the 970 deliver more accurate results than the already-reliable 965.</p><p>Otherwise, there are very few software differences between the 970 and 965, aside from new advanced running dynamics tools: Running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss.</p><p>Running tolerance "better understands the impact each run has on the body," with a "recommended weekly maximum mileage" to warn you off of overtraining. Running economy focuses on your "overall energy efficiency," while step speed loss calculates "how much an athlete slows down when their foot hits the ground." But since the latter two require buying and wearing the new $169 HRM 600 chest strap, only running tolerance is built into the Forerunner 970.</p><p>The Forerunner 970 ships in Carbon Grey DLC, Titanium, and Soft Gold in one 47mm size and is available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1462801/">Garmin's site</a>. It ships on May 21.</p>

<p>With a starting price of $699.99, the standard Motorola Razr (2025) features a 6.9-inch AMOLED folding display with a 3.6-inch cover display, while under the hood you&apos;ll get an efficient MediaTek Dimensity 7400X processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery that should easily clear a full day on a single charge. If you want a powerful foldable that won&apos;t break the bank, the base model Razr (2025) is the flip phone for you.  </p>

<ul><li>Google is putting the spotlight on how Chromebooks are making school way more accessible, especially for students with disabilities.</li><li>ChromeVox will soon turn audio captions into braille when connected to a braille display.</li><li>Natural-sounding “read aloud” voices are now built right in Chrome's Reading Mode, which is great news for students with dyslexia or reading struggles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is spotlighting how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">Chromebooks</a> are helping students with disabilities thrive in observance of the Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/global-accessibility-awareness-day-2025" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Tricia Davis-Muffett, a senior director at Google for Education, shared how Google's approach to accessibility on Chromebooks is making education more inclusive.</p><p>Some students can’t use a mouse or keyboard easily, Davis-Muffett noted. This is where Chromebook's Face Control steps in, literally letting students navigate their devices with facial gestures such as head tilts and eyebrow raises instead of mouse clicks.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-are-getting-new-real-time-controls-and-engagement-tools-for-educators">rolled out this feature in January with ChromeOS 132</a>, and it’s based on Android’s Project Gameface.</p><p>On top of this feature, the tech giant announced today that ChromeVox, the built-in screen reader for Chromebooks, is getting a nifty upgrade. Soon, when connected to a braille display, it’ll convert audio captions into braille.</p>
<h2 id="braille-gets-a-boost-2">Braille gets a boost</h2>
<p>That means students with visual impairments can independently read what’s on screen without waiting for anyone else to catch them up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6" name="Acer Chromebook" alt="Acer Chromebook on table open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeVox, Google's built-in screen reader, was introduced in Chrome OS version 56.</p><p>Furthermore, for visually impaired students (and keyboard power users), Caret Browsing lets them move through a webpage using only their keyboard. It drops a blinking cursor on the page, like in a Word document, and it’s all arrow keys and tab navigation from there.</p><p>Google also highlights Chrome’s Reading Mode, touting that it now offers a “read aloud” feature with natural-sounding voices. This feature is particularly beneficial for students who struggle with dyslexia or other reading challenges. And because it's baked right into Chromebooks, there’s no need for third-party software.</p>
<h2 id="standardized-test-friendly-2">Standardized test-friendly</h2>
<p>If you're taking the SAT or AP exams on a Chromebook, the College Board’s Bluebook app now works hand-in-hand with ChromeOS accessibility features like Dictation and ChromeVox. This eliminates the need for separate testing accommodations.</p><p>The best part is that these tools aren’t tucked away or hidden behind premium paywalls since they're baked into Chromebooks and ready to go from the first login. Google also highlights how partner apps from the Google for Education App Hub are building even more support on top of these features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Each year, Google announces a slew a features for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) and this year isn't any different. Today (May 15), Google announced that it is rolling out new updates to its products across Android and Chrome, and adding new resources for developers who building speech recognition tools.</p><p>Google is highlighting how it's integrating Gemini and AI into its accessibility features to improve usability for users with low vision or hearing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM" name="Gemini-Talkback-Option-" alt="Google brings Gemini powered updates for GAAD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expanding its existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-google-talk-back">TalkBack</a> option with the ability for people to ask questions and get responses related to the image that they were sent or are viewing. That means the next time a friend texts you a photo of their new guitar, users can get a description of the image and ask follow-up questions about the make and color, or even what else is in the image.</p><p>Taking it a step further with AI, Google says users can not only get descriptions of the image, but also the entire screen they're viewing. For instance, "if you’re shopping for the latest sales on your favorite shopping app, you can ask Gemini about the material of an item or if a discount is available," the tech giant explained.</p>
<p>Google is launching a much-needed feature called Expressive Captions, which helps the listener gauge the mood and emotion of the video. The tech giant states that phones will be able to provide real-time captions for anything with sound across apps.</p><p>It uses AI to not only capture what someone says, but more importantly, how they say it. For instance, if you're watching an intense game and the commentator is calling out an “amaaazing shot,” or when the video message is not “no” but a “nooooo.”</p><p>This AI-powered feature will be able to identify sounds that are dragging out words, to give you accurate captions. It can also spot when people are whistling or clearing their throats, making captions less redundant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY" name="Google-GAAD-Expressive-captions" alt="Expressive captions on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new version of Expressive Captions is rolling out in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia for devices running Android 15 and above.</p><p>Lastly, Google is taking steps to continue to make its digital platform more accessible and inclusive. It is giving developers access to its open-source repository from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition/"> Project Euphonia</a> (How AI improves products for people with impaired speech).</p><p>By opening up its resources, developers around the world will be able to personalize audio tools for research ,which could help train their models for diverse speech patterns, Google explained.</p>

<p>Honor 400 series is gearing up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-launching-globally-may-22">launch next week</a>, and ahead of its release, the company already has some exciting AI news about the upcoming devices to share.</p><p>The devices are said to be debuting with a Google Cloud-powered AI image-to-video feature that allows users to transform static images like their personal photos into AI-generated artwork into a five-second video, which for some reason is believed to be shareable on social media.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.94%;"><img id="Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo-1" alt="Honor AI image to video feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="281" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upcoming Honor 400 models are already touted to have flagship-level AI capabilities, alongside having the best AI camera phone in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> segment. Users are further expected to get creative control without relying on third-party apps. The demos of the newly announced AI feature also appear promising, as Honor has shared some videos (converted to GIFs, and the quality might be affected) of the same.</p><p>The static images here include Lady with an Ermine, a self-portrait of Van Gogh, Las Meninas, a sunrise impression, and The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs painting by Georges de La Tou. Converting such static images and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubMmbFvCf5Q">actual photos of people</a> into video clips certainly looks impressive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo" alt="Honor AI image to video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Honor 400 series will have a real advantage, we would definitely be seeing it in other Android handsets soon since it is based on Google Cloud, the search giant’s Veo 2 model, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664812/google-honor-ai-image-to-video-gemini">The Verge</a>, and it is already available on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> subscription — however, it is currently based on text input and not image-to-video as seen in the upcoming Honor 400 series. The latter is still available in Google Cloud, and the search giant is charging 50 cents per second of output — and also available only for “approved users.”</p><p>And there’s yet another catch as well, per the publication, the AI image-to-video will be free for Honor 400 users for the first two months, and a limit of only ten videos per day. Honor’s U.K. marketing director, Chris Langley, has further confirmed to The Verge that the feature to stay active would “eventually require some subscription” from Google.</p>
