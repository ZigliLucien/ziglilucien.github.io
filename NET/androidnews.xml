<ul><li>Chrome is seen testing a new "Browser health" option that will help with improving user experience and browser slowdowns.</li><li>This option will be added to a dedicated "performance" panel on the main menu for easier access, along with the battery saver and memory saver tools.</li><li>Chrome seems to be following Microsoft Edge's footsteps, as the panel looks a lot like Edge's "Browser Essential" hub.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ever get annoyed when you are in peak work mode with multiple tabs open on Chrome and the dreaded feeling when you see the "stop responding" message? This experience can slow down productivity as the browser might be using too many resources. Google is trying to help you keep up with your daily activities by adding this new performance tool to their browser.</p><p>Chrome has been revamping itself with new extensions and features, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">powerful tools like Gemini </a>added to the mix, it is sure to take up some room in the browser. To ensure better execution, a new "Browser health" section was spotted by a tipster on X, who goes by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64">Leopeva64.</a></p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I GUESS this new "Browser Health" section will be similar to Edge's "Browser Essential" hub and will show you recommended actions to improve the memory and CPU consumption of your open tabs: pic.twitter.com/RmJvF5NIhW<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1787191383113060395">May 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The new option will join the Memory Saver and Battery saver, tools that are tucked away inside the Performance page in the "More tools" submenu. However, now, it looks like this is expected to become a standalone "Performance" panel, helping users track the web browser&apos;s overall performance without leaving the current page.</p><p>From the screenshots, it looks like the Browser health option will offer users easy access to recommendations on how to improve the memory and CPU usage of their open tabs. This is something that we all look forward to when Chrome gets cluttered, especially since the browser can often use up a lot of RAM.</p><p>The tipster adds that this feature resembles Edge&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/browser-essentials?form=MA13FJ">"Browser Essential" hub</a>, which includes features like a Performance detector, sleeping tabs, and efficiency mode. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google will move the "Performance" entry to the main menu (it was previously hidden in the "More tools" submenu), and the "Memory Saver" and "Battery Saver" sections have already been added to the Performance panel (Chrome Canary):https://t.co/xqfhZU9Wcphttps://t.co/OyC1fWt2sc pic.twitter.com/jc8Q7Pj1fa<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1727378428880716091">November 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It remains unclear when Google is set to roll out this option, as this was spotted on Chrome Canary. However, the company seems to be making a clear statement about keeping Chrome slowdowns to a minimum with this performance panel.</p>

<h2 id="it-doesn-apos-t-cost-much-to-get-the-best-google-pixel-8a-screen-protection-2">It doesn&apos;t cost much to get the best Google Pixel 8a screen protection</h2>
<p>Much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">excellent pricing of the Pixel 8a</a>, its accessories also give you bang for your buck. None of the best Google Pixel 8a screen protectors cost more than $10, and these are all multipacks we&apos;re talking about. This gives you spares for emergencies or to share with family and friends.</p><p>Before buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> screen protector, make up your mind about whether you want something made of glass or plastic. Plastic refers to TPU and PET films, which can be surprisingly reliable. They don&apos;t offer better shatter-proofing than tempered glass, but plastic films can self-heal from minor scratches and they are much thinner so you get better touch sensitivity.</p><p>When it comes to tempered glass screen guards for the Pixel 8a, you have an insanely wide array of options. The JETech Screen Protector 3-Pack is the best overall pick in this category at the moment. You get high-grade tempered glass screen protectors with oleophobic properties. This means each of the three screen protectors in the box repels liquids and solids, so they stay squeaky clean. JETech also gives you an installation frame, so you can easily apply the screen guards by yourself at home without misaligning them or getting air bubbles.</p><p>If you prefer flexible films that can heal small scrapes and abrasions, Supershieldz has a budget-friendly three-pack of PET films you should check out. Films are super thin so they offer higher touch response as opposed to tempered glass. This set is case-friendly too, so you don&apos;t have to worry about compatibility issues with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">Pixel 8a case</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next Galaxy foldables should launch as early as July and new information indicates critical changes are coming to the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s cover screen ahead of the launch.</p><p>According to a reliable tipster, Ice Universe on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-aims-for-sweet-spot-wider-galaxy-z-fold-6-cover-screen/">SamMobile</a>), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will likely have a wider cover screen than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The tipster indicates that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 could have a cover screen measuring 60.2mm in width instead of the 57.4mm from the previous iteration.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy Z Fold6's external screen width is 60.2mm, while the Fold5's external screen width is 57.4mm. Therefore, you can get a wider external screen, which is beneficial to the experience, but not too wide. pic.twitter.com/j2eLPJELx4<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1787832306788601917">May 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Ice Universe managed to share the possible third-party screen protectors of the Z Fold 6, which has not only revealed the size of the cover screen but has also further indicated that it will have a flatter surface and squared corners rather than rounded from the previous model.</p><p>After three years, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 may get a better and larger cover screen if the third-party screen protector that the tipster provided is accurate. This is because the cover screens of the previous three generations of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> were nearly identical.</p><p>While it sounds too good to be true, it will be encouraging to see if Samsung opts for it. A wider cover screen also means wider real estate; thus, the use case should be much easier, similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>.</p>

<p>In another recent X post, Ice Universe shared some interesting details about the foldable screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. This time, The folding screen will likely look more squarish when unfolded in a design similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">first renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 also indicated similar design elements.</p><p>In April, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-display-sizes-and-weight-tipped">tipped</a> to be thinner and lighter than the predecessor as it is expected to weigh 239 grams, down from 256 grams on the Z Fold 5. In terms of thickness, the drive should likely measure 5.6mm (unfolded) and 12.1mm (in folded state); in comparison, the previous iteration measures 6.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has just wrapped up the launch of the new Pixel 8a and the Pixel Tablet. On the other hand, the company has also put out the May update to its Pixel phones today (May 7).</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/273300936/google-pixel-update-may-2024?hl=en&sjid=9398719716867767018-AP">community post</a>, Google announced the update rollout to Pixel devices running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, including Pixel 5a and above. The global versions of these handsets carry <strong>AP1A.240505.004/005</strong> builds and also include the Pixel Tablet. While the rollout begins today, Google says it will continue in phases over the next week, depending on the carrier and handset model.</p>

<p>While the May update includes the latest security patch, it brings in bug fixes and improvements for Pixel users. The improvements can be seen in the stability or performance of Bluetooth LE audio for the aforementioned Pixel devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and Pixel Tablet.                                                                                                                                              </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> owners who faced issues in camera performance under certain scenarios, such as when recording a video, a new fix has been included in the latest update.</p>
<p>The latest Pixel phones update follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-may-2024-update">Pixel Watch</a> update that came in earlier today.

<ul><li>Vivo confirmed on Weibo that its upcoming X100 Ultra and X100s flagship series phones will arrive on May 13.</li><li>The Ultra model is rumored to feature a 200MP telephoto sensor, a 50MP primary lens, and a periscope lens.</li><li>The X100s series devices will supposedly feature MediaTek's latest Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC and a 6.7-inch display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Vivo has confirmed that its upcoming X100 Ultra and the X100s series will arrive on May 13.</p><p>The company highlighted as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/OcZJNAQ6u">on Weibo</a>, while also giving consumers a decent look at what the devices will look like (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/423138/vivo-x100-ultra-launch-date-x100s-x100s-pro.html">fonearena</a>). The X100 Ultra continues Vivo&apos;s trend of a large circular triple-camera housing array in the center of its back panel. However, the lenses are in a square formation rather than a diamond, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>.</p><p>Vivo&apos;s confirmation video shows that Zeiss still powers the device&apos;s camera system. Moreover, the back paneling has been upgraded with a glossier finish, rather than the matte look the Pro model delivers. The upcoming X100 Ultra also appears to have a slightly curved display along its edges, as well.</p>

The camera housing is speculated to hold a 50MP LYT-900 primary lens, a periscope lens, and a 200MP telephoto lens with an f/2.67 aperture.</p><p>Known Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OcZyzbRzx">Digital Chat Station</a> chimed in, suggesting the Ultra will arrive in Black, Titanium, and White colorways.

<p>The X100s and X100s Pro are rumored to feature a 6.7-inch display, similar to the Pro variant from 2023. Unlike the upcoming Ultra model, Vivo&apos;s teaser shows that the X100s series will sport flat edges and sides. Internally, the devices are expected to arrive powered by MediaTek&apos;s recently debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> chipset. The chip launched today (May 7), featuring higher clock speeds and better AI processing over the base 9300.</p><p>Vivo is keeping the design theme consistent across these two new additions with the centered circular camera array.</p><p>The company is suggested to offer the base X100s model with the following RAM/internal storage options: 12/256GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16/1TB. The device should be available in black, blue, titanium, and white colorways. The X100s Pro is expected to have the same RAM/storage options; however, its colorways will drop the blue option.</p><p>Similarly, the pricing leak states the 1TB option for the X100s and X100s Pro could pick up a 5,199 yuan ($720) and 6,199 yuan ($855) tag, respectively.</p><p>We&apos;re one week away from Vivo&apos;s debut event on May 13. At that event, we&apos;ll learn more concrete details about these upcoming flagship phones.</p>

<ul><li>Today (May 7), Meta announced new generative AI tools, such as image and text generation, arriving for businesses and advertisers.</li><li>The former leverages AI to alter an original photo with varying backgrounds and creative input, while the latter assists with titles and descriptions.</li><li>Meta Verified for Business is also expanding its test to more countries and the company is preparing to bring the program to WhatsApp "soon."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Businesses and advertisers are receiving some new AI-powered capabilities on Meta&apos;s platform.</p><p>Meta states in a press release that its generative AI software is arriving for advertisers in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/297506218282224?id=649869995454285">image generation</a>. Those getting involved can now create "full image variations" alongside text overlaying capabilities for their ads. Meta says users can use its AI software to create several variations of the original advertisement.</p><p>Not only is the AI said to alter the background of the photo, but it can even change the subject of the image to give users "more creative options."</p><p>Meta&apos;s full image variations and text overlay have already started rolling out and the company plans to introduce "text prompts" so users can receive more personalized AI creations. The post then teases that "image expansion" is on the horizon for advertisers looking to place their content in Reels and Feed for Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>The company states that the feature will let such users alter the aspect ratio across multiple mediums so that the image is shown appropriately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1081px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.50%;"><img id="gemSRvRvcHdHBdgUhL7Q4n" name="meta-image-generation-ai-capabilities-businesses.jpg" alt="Meta is bringing a few generative AI tools to businesses and advertisers backed by generative AI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gemSRvRvcHdHBdgUhL7Q4n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1081" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The generative AI additions continue with "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/180641596861873">text generation</a>." The feature is said to help advertisers create a catchy headline while helping with a primary text. The ability of the AI to properly replicate your brand&apos;s voice is still being tested. Meta teases that it plans for the AI to make callbacks to previous ad campaigns once testing is complete.</p><p>When everything is done, Meta plans to provide such voice and tone capabilities through its Llama 3 next-gen large language model (LLM).</p><p>Image generation and text generation are rolling out today (May 7). Meta plans to make them available globally by the "end of the year." However, Meta highlights that text generation and overlay will begin for English before arriving for others.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zGi9bmXX83DkDhaFhV2EAH" name="Meta-logo-facebook-page-on-laptop.jpg" alt="Meta's company page on Facebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGi9bmXX83DkDhaFhV2EAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To make things easier, Meta said it is housing all of its new generative AI efforts under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/297506218282224?id=649869995454285">Advantage Plus Creative</a> for businesses looking to start their journey. This manager is picking up some notable updates alongside the previously mentioned gen AI features.</p><p>Businesses will soon find better optimization options for video ads in Reels and for the Facebook and Instagram mobile apps. For "catalog ads," which are the recommendations users see, Meta is rolling out the ability to use videos or demonstration videos instead of static photos.</p><p>Moreover, Advantage Plus Creative&apos;s influence in catalog ads brings the capabilities of Meta&apos;s AI to the table. The post states businesses can now display a "hero" image on their video. Meta adds that its AI software will take this image and "dynamically show" a company&apos;s "best product" to help drive interaction.</p><p>The post concludes by stating that Meta Verified for Business is expanding its test on Facebook and Instagram. The company adds that the program is available today (May 7) in Australia and New Zealand and will soon arrive in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Peru, France, and Italy. Additionally, Meta is preparing to bring the verified badge service to WhatsApp "soon."</p><p>This expansion will bring its subscription plan to four, enabling Meta to support a "wider range of business needs."</p>

<p>Boasting a tiny 6.1-inch display, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> is a small device. As such, you don&apos;t want to destroy the beauty of a small and lightweight phone by bulking it up with a fat cover. This doesn&apos;t mean you need to forgo protection because luckily, the best Pixel 8a cases come in sleek sizes.</p><p>Our favorite case for the new Pixel is — unsurprisingly — the Spigen Liquid Air. This wonderful thin case for the Pixel 8a is drop-proof, affordable, extremely lightweight, and stylish all at once. Raised edges thwart direct contact with surfaces in the event of a fall and Spigen&apos;s Air Cushion technology improves shock absorption while minimizing damage. I just wish there were more than two dark colors to choose from.</p><p>If you want something flashier, try the Poetic Guardian MagPro Case for the Google Pixel 8a. This bumper cover touts military-grade drop-proofing, which is incredible. This is achieved by adding a built-in screen protector and raising the edges by a good amount. What&apos;s fun about this Pixel 8a case is that it is see-through, so you can admire your phone&apos;s paint job, and it has a MagSafe ring on the back. This enables you to use any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories for Android phones</a> with your Pixel 8a.</p><p>Haven&apos;t placed your order yet?

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One of YouTube's experimental AI features, called "jump ahead," is now being tested with many YouTube Premium subscribers.</li><li>The feature uses AI to figure out the best parts of a YouTube video and automatically skip to them to save users' time.</li><li>It's like the standard skip tool for YouTube videos but powered by AI. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-jump-ahead-ai-experimental-feature">testing "jump ahead,"</a> an AI-assisted feature that will automatically skip to the best or most important parts of YouTube videos, in a wider experiment for YouTube Premium subscribers. It takes watch data from real users and analyzes them with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to find the most-watched sections. Essentially, it&apos;s like skimming the summary of a book online instead of reading the whole thing. </p><p>YouTube&apos;s algorithm will pick these key points in a video, and you can skip through them. Or, if you&apos;re in the middle of watching a video, you can "jump ahead" to the closest key point in a YouTube video. </p><p>However, this won&apos;t work for every YouTube video during this growing test. We don&apos;t know the exact qualifications needed for "jump ahead" to be an option for a video. It could be based on how many views a video gets, because perhaps YouTube needs a big enough viewer sample size to identify those key points. This is all speculation for now, and we&apos;ll likely learn more about this feature if it progresses in development. </p><p>Our knowledge of the feature now comes from YouTube&apos;s Creator Insider channel, which detailed the "jump ahead" feature in a March 2024 video:</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OX-OthHWAA?start=8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Jump Ahead works in tandem with the regular skip video on YouTube. If you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">Premium user</a> on an eligible video, you may see the jump ahead option when you try to do a regular 10-second skip. If you tap the option that appears, YouTube will move you to the next key point in a given YouTube video. </p><p>This functionality is exclusive to the YouTube for Android app, at least at the moment. In a sidebar, YouTube explains that jump ahead "is a Premium-only feature that combines watch data and AI to help identify the next best point a viewer typically skips ahead to."</p><p>You can try jump ahead through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank">YouTube&apos;s new experiments page</a>, and it is opt-in. For now, YouTube has set an end date for the test early next month, but it&apos;s possible the platform could keep it going for longer.</p>

<p>The launch of the new Razr phones might be a couple of months away, but the Razr 50 Ultra, aka the Razr Plus 2024, may be on its way soon, as a possible live image of the latter has now surfaced online.</p><p>The live image of the Razr 50 Ultra is shared by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1787389107171152062">Sudhanshu Ambhore</a> on X in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-motorola-razr-50-ultra-live-image-imminent-launch/">91mobiles</a>, wherein we also get to know about the colorways of the upcoming foldable phone next to its storage options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:431px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:139.21%;"><img id="yJ6wEFHPeLkJNGEcdMxRy9" name="motorola-razr-50-ultra-live-image-leak.jpg" alt="Razr 50 Ultra/Plus 2024 live image leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJ6wEFHPeLkJNGEcdMxRy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="431" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the published live image, the Razr 50 Ultra doesn&apos;t look radically different from the predecessor Razr 40 Ultra/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a>. It carries the same aesthetic as the predecessor, including a wider cover screen with horizontal dual cameras and the Razr logo at the chin. The folding screen with punch hole cut out can also be seen in the shared live image, which will likely have thinner bezels.</p><p>As for the button placements, the volume rocker and power button are on the right pane of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. The publication further shares the possible colorways of the Razr 50 Ultra, likely to be Blue, Orange, and Green variants. The predecessor came in Black, Blue, Magenta, and Peach color options. The foldable handset will be bearing the <strong>XT-24510-3</strong> model number and is expected to be shipped in a 12GB RAM variant with 512GB of onboard storage.</p>
<p>The new render from 91mobiles follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">first supposed render</a> that came in January 2024 and included an identical design. Over the last couple of months, the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024 has also been spotted in various certification sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50-ultra-bis-india-launch-expected-soon/">BIS</a>, EEC, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-reaches-radio-certification">Radio Certification</a> in China. </p><p>These certifications don&apos;t reveal significant specs of the foldable but only point to the fact that the launch is sooner rather than later. Going by the launch timeframe of the previous models, we should likely see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> hitting the stores sometime next month.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Ever heard of an RFID blocker? If you&apos;re interested in wallet cases for your phone or even wallets in general, you might have heard the term. A lot of wallets and wallet accessories, such as MagSafe wallet add-ons, boast RFID-blocking as a feature. What is this feature, and why is it important anyway? I&apos;m here to shed some light on this matter.</p><p>Contactless payments weren&apos;t as widespread a couple of years ago, but they&apos;re all the rage right now. NFC-based services like "Tap to Pay" and the marriage of Google Wallet with Google Pay have ushered in a new era where we feel comfortable storing our credit cards, debit cards, IDs, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">driving licenses digitally</a>. Our overall trust in such payment methods has increased. Even modern debit and credit cards that use "Tap to Pay" rely on NFC to work.</p><p>Unbeknownst to most people, however, this system has a glaring security flaw. Although many security mechanisms protect personal and financial details when you depend on contactless payment mechanisms, these NFC-based systems are still unable to prevent certain activities.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t worry; I&apos;m not going to bore you with technical details that you don&apos;t understand anyway. The problem is extremely simple, to the point that it&apos;s ridiculous.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-contactless-payments-2">Understanding contactless payments</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s start by breaking down how NFC-based payments are made. You use your phone&apos;s or smartwatch&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> or e-wallet by enabling NFC and adding your supported credit or debit cards to it. Most banks in the world require you to set up limits for contactless digital transactions. Select transactions over a certain limit may require additional authentication, such as a PIN, a one-time password (OTP), or biometric verification.</p><p>However, for contactless digital transactions within the bank&apos;s specified limits, your device does not usually need additional authentication after initial setup and verification. After all, this is what makes it a convenient payment method on the go. You tap your device or "Tap to Pay"-enabled card to make a payment, and then you&apos;re off on your way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nrqkh5HfztKp2zRgfifXcS" name="TicWatch-Pro-3-Wear-OS-Google-Pay-lifestyle-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Google Wallet on Wear OS device, TicWatch Pro 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrqkh5HfztKp2zRgfifXcS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with relying on NFC is that it activates as soon as it detects a compatible payment device nearby. Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, wearable, or card automatically makes a payment when it detects a compatible machine nearby, usually if the phone has been unlocked within a few minutes of the purchase. As long as your device&apos;s NFC is enabled, this will happen automatically. It gets worse with your cards because those don&apos;t have the option to disable NFC.</p><p>You could place your wallet or phone near a contactless payment card machine, and it could automatically make a payment, even if you didn&apos;t intend to use it. Now, this might sound silly, but there are actual reports of people facing this issue.</p><p>For example, a user called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/thread/197094676/automatically-paid-without-consent">Aram Dermenjian 2298 took to the Google Wallet support page</a> to address this issue in January 2023. The user complained that their Google Wallet made a payment without their consent because of the unlocked phone&apos;s close proximity to the payment machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7qCwyttCFPnGUDqWYKoWfB" name="google-wallet-automatic-payment-complain.jpg" alt="Google Wallet support page complaint about non-consensual payment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7qCwyttCFPnGUDqWYKoWfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1882" height="1059" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aram Dermenjian 2298 had no intention of paying for their purchase with their Google Wallet&apos;s primary card as it was a business expense. However, because of the nature of NFC payments, the payment automatically went out because their phone detected the payment machine and initiated the transaction.</p><p>I am not a fintech professional by any means, but this non-consensual transaction sent alarm bells ringing through my head. There are so many unfortunate scenarios where this flaw could be taken advantage of. The worst part is that the only real solution to this is to disable your NFC when your wallet isn&apos;t in use or to add more passwords and locks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519">additional verification</a>, which kills the convenience of the system itself.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-where-rfid-blockers-come-in-2">This is where RFID blockers come in</h2>
<p>While you can add a ton of extra preventive measures to your phone or wearable to stop this from happening, things aren&apos;t as easy with your credit or debit cards. This is where RFID and NFC-blocking wallets come into play.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The best way to block NFC or RFID signals is by using an aluminum plate.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The best way to block NFC or RFID signals is by placing an aluminum plate on top of your cards or on the back of your phone. This can be done with the help of an RFID-blocking wallet or wallet case for your phone. Fortunately, these can be found a dime a dozen. It is a pretty simple and easy idea that reduces the number of things you need to carry. Most importantly, however, this solution prevents unfavorable scenarios from happening, such as unintentional payouts from your e-wallet or bank cards.</p><p>You can find an RFID-blocking wallet or wallet case at affordable pricing from most retailers. If you&apos;re using a flagship phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, recommend the Scooch Wingmate as it&apos;s a wallet case with an RFID-blocking metal plate baked in.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to buy an accessory, even some aluminum foil will do the trick. Now that you&apos;re aware of this situation, be sure to take the necessary precautions.</p>
