With seconds to spare, I cleaned up my fingerprints, stashed the mystery man's belongings, and slowly opened the door to greet two officers who had weapons drawn on me.</p><p>Just 30 seconds later, I was pronounced innocent and allowed to go on my merry old way. Except, I found that hiding this guy's corpse was more fun than I had anticipated and, apparently, the universe was giving me an unlimited number of times to replay this scenario. It was like the movie Groundhog Day with a dash of Weekend at Bernie's thrown in for good measure.</p><p>If you hadn't already guessed it, the game is called Hide the Corpse, and it's available on the Meta Quest platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/hide-the-corpse/8714253315313680/">for just $15</a>.

The game has over half a dozen levels, each with at least six different places to hide the mystery man Gus's corpse.</p><p>Despite what the subject matter might make you think, Hide the Corpse is a strangely family-friendly title that has no foul language, no violence (other than dragging a corpse around, I suppose), and little else that might trigger you to hide its existence in front of your kids.</p><p>That, of course, meant that my son and I spent hours laughing until we cried as we struggled to drag around Gus's insanely heavy corpse without running into the furniture in our real living room. Seriously, it's a hilariously good time that's guaranteed to make you laugh.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="obm7TPnxq3z2bjcxLAZqyY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

Even more so given that you only have four minutes to somehow bring him to a legit hiding spot and cram him into whatever dimensions said spot allows.</p><p>The intro level takes place in an apartment where you can hide Gus in strangely conspicuous places like the bathtub, the armoire, under the bed, and three other spots I don't want to ruin. You'd think the cops would find him in these places, but they're, thankfully, no Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>The goal is to just hide Gus's corpse from plain sight, a goal that becomes zanier and zanier as you progress through the levels. And I promise that you never realized how heavy a corpse could be in zero gravity until you get to the space level!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6Ko5Ekyu38qQb9uC6Gw2Z" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-02" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

The man somehow has several of his belongings scattered randomly in each level, including his comb, wallet, favorite record (this is 70s themed), driver's license, and a few other nicknacks. Each of these also needs to be hidden from plain sight to get the best score.</p><p>Oh, and don't forget to erase <em>every single one</em> of the fingerprints you left along the way. Seriously, those little blue fingerprints appear on anything you've touched, even if you didn't realize you'd touched it. It's an almost overwhelming amount of stuff to do in just four minutes, but it results in some gratifying gameplay in a short span.</p><p>When the time is up, either at the four-minute mark or when you open the door for the cops, you'll get graded on your performance. I'm not sure who grades someone on their ability to hide a corpse, but I hope I never run across them in real life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest showing the cops finding Gus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HyperVR Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you find enough hiding spots in each level, you'll unlock a new level to play in. The scenarios are incredibly varied, ranging from the apartment you start in to the diner I spoke of earlier, a zero-gravity space station, an art museum, and more. The latest update in mid-July added a ton of new modifiers, including a <strong>heavier</strong> Gus and the ability to double the hiding time.</p><h2 id="alone-or-with-friends-it-s-a-riot-2">Alone or with friends, it's a riot</h2><p>While it's a single-player game, I found it to be the most fun when casting the gameplay to a TV while others in the room were watching. This <em>always</em> elicited people asking to try it and then spending multiple sessions in the game until someone pried the headset from their cold, not-dead hands. Definitely not dead. That only happens in the game.</p><p>It's the kind of zany, whimsical, unique fun that I love seeing from indie developers and a reminder of the late 90s and early 2000s era of gaming, where just about any theme or concept could make a game, no matter how surreal or ridiculous. Plus, at just $15, it's tough to say no to for a few fantastic hours of entertainment with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, the video explains the difficulties with removing the foldable's display, as Samsung introduced "heatless back panel removal," which caused too many issues. Thus, they were forced to gain entry near its cameras.</p><p>Removing the first battery is like moving through a maze—if the maze consisted of cables, screws (and more screws), and press connectors. The first battery, or rather, how Samsung implemented its removal process, was another gripe for iFixit. The video states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Fold 7</a> features a thin pull tab. While this seems useful, iFixit states the tabs need "too much force" and could end up tearing.</p><p>More than that, if you're <em>too </em>forceful with the tab, you could bend the battery and risk ruining it.</p><p>After popping out the motherboard (yet another maze), iFixit gets to the camera. This is important as, according to iFixit, Samsung used a similar structure that it has other models. However, this means that a "full disassembly" of your device is required if something goes wrong with the camera.</p><h2 id="night-terrors-of-an-inner-screen-2">Night Terrors of an Inner Screen</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KhF6emBjbE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The inner display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably going to be the worst nightmare any would-be repairperson would ever see. The teardown explains that the inner display is the more "fragile" aspect of this device, and that's only magnified when you consider Samsung's recent advancements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">help it reach 500,000 folds</a> (~10 years). The bezels are glued in, forcing iFixit to take uncomfortable means to remove them.</p><p>Moreover, the company states that you'd only ever remove the inner display if it's already damaged. This is because the inner screen is "sensitive to pressure and torsional rotation," so by the end of this teardown, the screen was more or less down and out.</p><p>Let's hope nothing goes wrong with your Fold 7 inner display, as iFixit states it would cost consumers a whopping $589 to replace it. You can check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/9KhF6emBjbE">the rest of iFixit's teardown</a> on the Fold 7 and see what happens to warrant its 3 out of 10 repairability score.</p><h2 id="tedious-difficult-2">Tedious, difficult</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mention of glued-down parts in the Galaxy Z Fold 7 teardown reminds us of why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">iFixit cut ties with Samsung</a> last year. The company said it made this decision as its ideals over repairability for consumers didn't align with Samsung's. Its announcement said that Samsung's devices are "glued together." This made it incredibly difficult for iFixit to provide the necessary parts for a device for consumers without raising prices.</p><p>Let's also not forget that our very own Andrew Myrick had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">a horrible experience</a> attempting to get a Galaxy Z Fold 4 repaired.</p><p>During its announcement, iFixit said while it's cutting ties with Samsung, it won't drop all parts just like that. The company will still try to retrieve components whenever it can; however, those useful guides iFixit usually provides will no longer be made.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Verizon has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g-update/">posted its changelog</a> for the update, stating the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra are on the receiving end of a new "Android security patch."</p><p>There's nothing else mentioned for this patch, so it's likely the bug/security fixes to keep the S20 series armored up.</p><p>While this patch isn't the latest, Verizon states owners of these devices are getting Samsung's July 2025 patch. The service states it released the update as of July 31, but it seems users are just now getting their hands on it more consistently. There's also some reported uncertainty behind whether or not Verizon customers will remain the only ones to receive this surprising update.</p><h2 id="the-journey-of-the-s20-2">The Journey of the S20</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g5CF9ERxPSjKtfrrcWRY9N" name="samsung-device-care-settings-s20.jpg" alt="Galaxy S20+ Device care settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5CF9ERxPSjKtfrrcWRY9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been on quite a journey with the Galaxy S20 series. After its initial debut in 2020, Samsung moved the series from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">monthly updates to quarterly</a> patches in 2024. This came in March last year, as Samsung started shifting away from that four-year-old series in favor of the (at the time) new Galaxy S24 series. The company also already met its previous agreement of three major Android OS upgrades, going from Android 10 to 13 in 2022.</p><p>After spending over a year with quarterly patches, Samsung delivered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s20-series-software-updates-samsung-support-ends">final security patch to the series</a> in April 2025 (or so we thought).</p><p>The company's security page no longer lists the main Galaxy S20 series after that update in April. It seemed to suggest that Samsung was done with the trio, considering its removal, but this new update for Q3 2025 goes against that. Perhaps now we've received the final patch. The Galaxy S20 FE was held separate from the main flagship group; however, its intended update for Q3 2025 might be its last.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But that's not really the case with the Galaxy Tab A9+, as it borrows the premium aluminum design from the more expensive Galaxy Tab S series. Sure, you might have wished to see an OLED display, but the LCD panel is still crisp thanks to its 1920 x 1200 resolution.</p><p>What about performance? Well, the Tab A9+ is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 695, paired with 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">expandable storage</a>. As for battery life, the Tab A9+ will just keep chugging along, as its  7,040mAh battery is rated for up to 20 hours on a single charge.</p><p>You'll also enjoy some surprising features, such as split-screen multitasking, Gaming Hub, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. So not only can use the Tab A9+ as a traditional tablet, but plug it into a monitor, and have a desktop-like experience.</p><p>The only glaring issue that I can see with the Galaxy Tab A9+ is its lack of S Pen support. That's definitely a bummer, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">other stylus options</a> out there that can help fill the void if you want to use this as a digital notebook.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/how-galaxy-watchs-innovative-sensor-breaks-new-ground-in-preventative-care">blog post</a>, the company states consumers with a Galaxy Watch 8 will have access to its Ectopic Beat Detection software for "actionable" insights. Samsung states this feature is designed to help users detect early signs of "premature heartbeats."</p><p>These early heartbeats, which is states can typically go unnoticed during routine checkups, can lead to arrhythmia and potentially evolve into a risk of heart failure.</p><p>The post highlights the Galaxy Watch 8's "enhanced" ECG sensor and its ability to inform users if it detects signs of ectopic beats.</p><p>Vascular Load is another preventative care feature Samsung has packed into the Galaxy Watch 8. This was a feature it teased a little before the devices launched in July, touting it as an AI-powered feature designed to determine the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/i-think-samsung-health-likely-to-get-ai-subscription-soon">strain on your heart</a>." Today, Samsung says that the watches utilize PPG waveforms to measure your blood flow and vascular stiffness throughout the night.</p><p>Samsung reports that daily stress, diet, and how much rest you get can affect this aspect of your health. If left unchecked, it could lead to more serious cardiovascular concerns.</p><h2 id="changing-lifestyle-habits-2">Changing Lifestyle Habits</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from an early warning system, Samsung says the Galaxy Watch 8 can also help users make well-informed decisions about their lifestyle. For example, the series features an "Antioxidant Index," which uses its BioActive sensors to scan your skin carotenoids. What this returns is a well-informed look into antioxidant levels, primarily based on the amount of fruits and vegetables you've consumed.</p><p>Users are given a score between 0-100. While Samsung says low fruit and vegetable intake can negatively impact this score (and your health overall), other factors like your diet, UV light exposure, and more can impact your antioxidant levels.</p><p>Additionally, "Bedtime Guidance" is designed to help users "build healthier sleep routines that lead to deeper, less interrupted sleep and more energized mornings." Samsung says this was developed alongside KAIST to help users understand their bodies and the right amount of sleep for them.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-aid-right-on-your-wrist-2">The Galaxy Watch 8: aid right on your wrist</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has been pushing the Galaxy Watch 8's health features, as we've seen with its Preventative Care (early detection) and lifestyle monitoring capabilities.

Meta's 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/reality-labs-shows-off-prototypes">Butterscotch Varifocal prototype</a> was the first to achieve 60 PPD, the "retinal resolution" threshold required to clearly render the 20/20 line of an eye chart.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V" name="Meta-Tiramisu-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of the Meta Tiramisu prototype on a man's face, a VR headset with a longer-than average design jutting out nearly a foot." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1326" height="746" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Tiramisu </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tiramisu's ultra-bright, high-res prototype crushes the retinal resolution threshold by an extra 30 PPD. The trade-off is that it only hits 33 degrees FoV, well below the range for proper immersion. They also "deprioritized the form factor," says OPALS scientist Xuan Wang, with heavier glass lenses for the best visual fidelity on par with HDR TVs.</p><p>Tiramisu would be inordinately expensive and uncomfortable for consumers. But it's a physical and metaphorical window into Reality Labs' investment in true visual immersion for future headsets. We wonder if it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/james-cameron-thinks-vr-is-definitive-way-to-watch-his-movies">"f***ing cool" prototypes James Cameron tried</a> that got him invested in VR filmmaking with Meta.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV" name="Meta-Boba-3-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of a man wearing the Meta Boba 3 prototype headset with a finger raised to tap a virtual object." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Boba 3 prototype, on the other hand, looks more polished and practical, though still a premium device. Developed by the Reality Labs Display Systems Research (DSR) team, it hits a 180-degree horizontal field of view (FoV) and 120-degree vertical FoV, using pancake lenses to keep it reasonably light at 660g.</p><p>It also uses "high-curvature reflective polarizers" to prevent light reflection, a necessity given that the curved display essentially points at itself along the edge.</p><p>Boba 3 delivers 30 PPD, slightly better than the Quest 3, but hitting 4K x 4K resolution with such a wide display has an incredible power demand, says DSR scientist Yang Zhao. Boba 3 "requires a top-of-the-line GPU and PC system" to fill all of that visual space; it's "not going to easily hit a mass-market price point," nor work as an all-in-one Quest-type product.</p><p>Still, it's impressive to see how the Boba 3 prototype covers 90% of the "FOV of the human visual system," to the point that you'd barely see any darkness around the display.</p><h2 id="will-the-meta-quest-4-follow-these-prototypes-example-2">Will the Meta Quest 4 follow these prototypes' example?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV" name="Meta-Boba-VR-prototypes" alt="A photo of Meta's prototype Boba 1, Boba 2, and Boba 3 headsets from left to right on a table, showing how they've gotten much smaller over time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Boba 1, 2, and 3 prototypes </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The blog post stresses that these are "purely research prototypes, with novel technologies that may never make their way into a consumer product."</p><p>But even if the Quest 4 can't match them, we can certainly hope it'll follow in these prototypes' footsteps and aspire to greater visual fidelity. Or if not, maybe the Quest 5 will.</p><p>"We’re working to figure out what lies beyond television and laptop screens," says DSR Director Douglas Lanman. "We’re just trying to make something awesome—not just as a demo, but as something that we’d use every day. And that really is the true Turing test: Are we excited about what we’re doing after a decade of doing it?"</p><p>Meta, as a company, is definitely interested in replacing TVs with its headsets. Meta's head of Oculus Publishing said earlier this year that by 2027, Meta wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">target young adults who will use the Quest as a "high-end TV."</a></p><p>It's a natural assumption that the Quest 4 will need to deliver better resolution and FoV to make its entertainment experience more dynamic. Its designers may have looked to OPALS and DSR for technical inspiration.</p><p>But the Quest 4 must also be light enough to be worn for hours and affordable enough that consumers will buy it. We'll see if it successfully hits that balance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Furthermore, the foldable is powered by the same Tensor G4 chipset that drives the rest of the Pixel 9 series, and you'll also get the same seven years of guaranteed OS and security support. </p><p>The trade-offs include some relatively disappointing camera tech (it's passable, but nothing amazing) and a lack of stylus support. These wouldn't be major issues on a different phone, but at this price I want to be blown away, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold just isn't as performant as we wanted in those regards. </p><p>With the imminent arrival of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold on August 20th (not to mention the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review#section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-software">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> from Samsung), last year's model could easily go overlooked. But if you enjoy the Pixel ecosystem and you're trying to get into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, this Best Buy deal presents a unique opportunity. After all, it's not like we expect the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to be <em>that</em> different from its predecessor, so why not go last-gen and save some serious cash in the process?</p> ]]></dc:content>

The triple camera array is off to one side of the phone, with its placement looking a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The image shows the device in a silver/white colorway, contrary to previous rumors of it launching in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-15-battery-leak-3569929/">SuperBlack color option </a>that makes the device look like a “black hole,” which is said to absorb 99.9% of all visible light.</p><p>This leak reinforces the fact that the triple camera setup (wide, ultra-wide, and 3x periscope) would feature 50MP lenses and a periscope telephoto lens, which could be as high as 200MP, according to a previous leak on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PwM6XAI07">Weibo</a>.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1mizj4f/oneplus_15_redesigned_hasselblad_camera_flagship">OnePlus 15: Redesigned Hasselblad Camera Flagship & Key Specs Leaked</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus">r/oneplus</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>We also know that OnePlus could potentially be letting go of its long-term relationship with Hasselblad, which could be the reason behind the redesign.</p><p>The Reddit post also mentions the alleged key specs of the device. Regarding the phone's screen, the tipster claims that the OnePlus 15 will feature a flat 1.5K AMOLED display with ultra-thin bezels, using LIPO display technology, measuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-leak-drops-some-spicy-changes-and-not-in-a-good-way-for-everyone">6.7 inches</a>. Additionally, the device is said to feature a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks"> "symmetrical front,"</a> meaning that all four bezels—top, bottom, and sides—are of equal or near-equal thickness, creating a cleaner design aesthetic, much like Apple's iPhones.</p><p>Under the hood, the device is said to have the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>, rumored to be launching in September this year. This powerful chip is rumored to have a clock speed of 5GHz due to "enhanced Pegasus cores." Potentially backing more of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus' AI</a> in its upcoming flagship.

The Watch 8 comes in two sizes of 40mm and 44mm, with prices starting at $349.99 and $379.99, respectively. The 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 features a 325mAh battery, and the 44mm version has a 435mAh capacity. Despite the difference in capacities, though, Samsung estimates up to 40 hours of runtime on one charge for both sizes. With the Always-on Display (AOD) feature enabled, this is said to drop to 30 hours.</p><p>While we've not yet tested the Galaxy Watch 8, we have finished our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">review of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>, which comes in a single 46mm dial size with a 445mAh battery.  Interestingly, Samsung has the same battery life estimates for the Classic as well. In our testing, we found the Watch 8 Classic to last for roughly 25 hours when really pushed, but it's usually double that when usage is light.</p><p>Since the 44mm version of the Galaxy Watch 8 has nearly the same capacity as the Watch 8 Classic, you should expect a similar battery life too. The same would apply to the 40mm version, too, since the smaller battery will be powering a smaller display. Overall, you should expect the Watch 8 to easily last an average of 1–2 days between charges, as do most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d3ec1869-e255-4699-9ac5-2069455a1e1d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A good starter option</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 has a new design and some cool new health tracking features.

No, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't perfect. It is, however, another few steps closer to the "endgame" for clamshell foldables — a slab phone you can fold in half without losing much. Instead of talking about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in terms of compromises, we're now looking at all the exclusive features and capabilities it offers compared to normal phones.</p><p>If you recently picked up a new Galaxy Z Flip 7, or are thinking of buying one, you'll want to do these 10 things immediately after unboxing it. They cover everything from the basics, to exclusive Samsung foldable features, to useful AI tools. Some are new to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and others have been staples of past Galaxy Z Flip models.</p><p>But every single one represents an essential tip or trick that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> owners need to know. Let's dive in and start playing around with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">brand-new folding phone</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-basics"><span>Set up the basics</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7hmjEwfmvCjKNXjn6EjUJg" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-1" alt="The lock screen on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hmjEwfmvCjKNXjn6EjUJg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you get a new Samsung phone, there are always a few mundane tasks you should complete before moving on to the fun stuff. They include setting up your biometrics, downloading your preferred password manager, and logging into your Google and Samsung accounts. You should also check for early updates by going to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>Download and install</strong>. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-new-foldables-get-first-update-just-days-after-launch" target="_blank">has already received its first OTA update</a>, so be sure to install it.</p><p>We'd also recommend tweaking your phone's settings to match your preferences. A common frustration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> is a change to lock screen notifications that shows icons instead of banners by default.

Personally, I always turn off <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> on my phones and even switch on <strong>Extra brightness</strong>. Sometimes, I'll swap out Samsung Keyboard for Gboard.</p><p>Whatever your list of base-level Android modifications is, make sure you handle those before moving to anything else.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-customize-the-cover-screen"><span>Customize the cover screen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-3" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a larger, 4.1-inch cover screen that tries to make it easier to view glanceable information and take actions without opening your phone. In my experience, that effort falls flat because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-is-somehow-worse-than-the-flip-6">certain cover screen options are gone in One UI 8</a> on the Flip 7. Still, there are a handful of things you can do to make the cover screen your own.</p><p>To do so, you can start by swiping to a widget panel on the cover screen, holding it, and pressing the <strong>Edit</strong> button. This will require you to open the phone, and it'll open up a Settings page for the cover screen. Alternatively, you can open the <strong>Settings </strong>app and tap <strong>Cover screen</strong> with the display open to get to this same spot. This is where you can manage widgets, lock screen and clock, notifications, and cover screen timeout.</p><p>After tapping the <strong>Widgets</strong> tab, you can start customizing your cover screen. Most widgets will be either 2x2 or 2x4 in size, so you can fit either two or four widgets per panel. Some third-party app widgets are supported on the cover screen, like Spotify, but these are the exception, not the rule. You can pick any widgets you like — I have Samsung Health, Sleep, Weather, News, Voice Recorder, and Battery on my cover screen.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-cover-screen-apps-with-multistar"><span>Enable cover screen apps with MultiStar</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apps aren't fully supported on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen, no matter what you install or which Labs features you enable. However, there are a few things you can do to make the experience usable. The first thing to do is add the <strong>Apps</strong> widget to your cover screen using the steps in the section above. This will give you a small home screen launcher with only a select few official apps — on my Flip 7, the only options are Google Maps, Google Messages, and (oddly) YouTube.</p><p>To find this page from anywhere, you can search <strong>Apps allowed on cover screen</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen, there's a <strong>Get MultiStar</strong> button that you should press if you want to run more cover screen apps. This will enable what is called the <strong>Launcher Widget</strong>, an experimental option that lets you run virtually any app on the cover screen.  I use the Tesla app on the cover screen of my Flip 7 to precondition my car without unfolding it. We have a complete guide to running apps on Galaxy Z Flip cover screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">here</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-try-out-flex-mode"><span>Try out Flex Mode</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-22" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-force-flex-mode-apps-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3">Flex Mode</a> is one of my favorite ways to use Samsung foldables, and it's a Galaxy Z Flip 7 essential. The way it works is simple. Open the foldable about halfway and rest it on a table, sort of like a laptop. Then, a small icon will float in the bottom-left corner of your screen. Tap it, and you'll see the Flex Mode user interface take over.</p><p>The Flex Mode experience will differ slightly depending on what's on your screen at the time. Some apps natively support Flex Mode, like YouTube, so you'll see video on the top half of the screen and playback controls, comments, and the description on the bottom. Other media apps might not, but One UI 8 creates a Flex Mode interface for it anyway. In the image above, I'm using Apple Music on the top half of the screen and a Flex Mode playback control UI on the bottom.</p><p>There are other cool Flex Mode experiences to try, like split-screen apps and a virtual touchpad. You should give them all a go, but I find that Flex Mode is most useful with media apps.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-test-camera-features-camcorder-mode"><span>Test camera features & Camcorder Mode</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-10" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVnpZPGvaat87e8gQej6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this is your first foldable phone, it might take you a bit to learn that you should use the selfie camera on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 <em>almost never</em>. The rear camera on this phone <em>is</em> your selfie camera, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">versatility is one of the best parts of daily driving a foldable</a>. To try it, open the camera from the cover screen just like you would on any Android phone. There are multiple ways to do so, including a double-press of the power button.</p><p>Don't just use it for selfies — get creative. Your Galaxy Z Flip 7 can also be used as a tripod thanks to its folding form factor. Next, try <strong>Cover screen preview</strong> —  it's the Flip 7 icon in the top-right corner of the camera app when unfolded.

Thanks to a new leak, we may have an idea of what's in store for the Pixel 10 series set to launch later this month.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-camera-coach">Android Headlines</a>, Google will integrate an AI-powered feature called "Camera Coach", and as the name suggests, it will coach users on how to click better, real-time images on their new Pixel device. Much like having a professional photographer teach you better techniques and best practices to achieve the perfect shot, on the go. This means you won't have to save those Instagram Reels teaching you how to adjust the aperture or use a different mode to take your pictures; it all comes built into the phone itself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication further notes how this feature might potentially come into play. "Things like adjusting your angle to better frame the picture, adjusting the lighting, and more." The feature sounds more like Gemini Live, but here you let the Camera Coach read the scene and offer suggestions based on what it's looking at.</p><p>This could potentially require users to live record their screen, or an icon could pop up, like Gemini, with prompts suggesting better photography tips. It remains a mystery how the Camera Coach will be able to read the scene; however, it seems like all this will happen instantly as the user turns on their camera.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get outside your comfort phone | 8.20.25Learn more and sign up for #MadeByGoogle updates: https://t.co/JOdjGMGYxY pic.twitter.com/nvXep5w5Ru<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1952400812862324931">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google seems to be leaning into Gemini to enhance the device's camera capabilities, or simply teach people how to use their phone's camera to the fullest.

With this feature, you can have a conversation with Gemini, asking it to make certain edits to their photos, like erasing noise, changing background, removing unnecessary objects, essentially giving them a clearer image.</p><p>While all this sounds fascinating, it remains unclear whether these features will be available only on the new flagship series or if Google will expand them to older Pixel devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.73%;"><img id="hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj" name="google-photos-ask-photos-quicker-answers" alt="Google Photos is boosting Ask Photos with quicker response times for broad/simple queries, while Gemini works in the background for more a more detailed/specific response." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="537" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, several rumors have suggested, the base Pixel 10 will show up with a triple camera array (including a 50MP main, a 12MP ultrawide, and an additional 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom) this time around. This was also confirmed by Google when it dropped a quick tease of the phone earlier this week. While the base model gets a bump with its camera specs, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL might see no change in terms of their camera hardware, which means Google needs to rely heavily on Gemini to up the ante on these next-gen flagships.</p><p>All eyes are on Google as it is all set to unveil the Pixel 10 series on August 20 in New York, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">here's what we expect to see coming from the event.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a question that's probably crossed your mind while scrolling through your gallery. The magic behind those impressive night shots isn't a single feature, but a symphony of hardware and software working in perfect harmony.</p><p>It's a far cry from the blurry, noisy images that were once the hallmark of low-light photography on older phones. Today's "night sight" and "astrophotography" photos are a testament to how far mobile technology has come.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ranYPSWZK7J6rgXNqzhDzh" name="Google-Pixel-8-astrophotography-sample.jpg" alt="Photo of the stars taken from a Google Pixel 8 using astrophotography mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ranYPSWZK7J6rgXNqzhDzh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Photo of the stars taken from a Google Pixel 8 using astrophotography mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A great night shot begins with the most fundamental component: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wants-rival-human-eye-600mp-camera-sensors">camera sensor</a>.  Think of the sensor as the camera's eye, capturing light and converting it into an electrical signal. In low-light situations, the challenge is to gather as much light as possible.</p><p>A camera sensor can see a lot more than your eye can, and sees more colors. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/may-2024-northern-lights-pixel-8-pro-galaxy-s24-plus">photos of the Northern Lights</a> looked better than the real thing; the camera processed all that information we <em>couldn't</em> see into something we can.</p><p>This is why a larger sensor can be important. A bigger sensor has more surface area, allowing it to collect even more photons (light particles) and produce a cleaner, less noisy image.</p><p>Alongside a larger sensor, a wider aperture helps, too. The aperture is the opening in the lens that lets light in. A wider aperture, represented by a smaller f-number (e.g., f/1.8 vs. f/2.2), allows more light to reach the sensor in a given amount of time. This combination of a large sensor and a wide aperture is the hardware foundation of a good night camera.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-for-the-software-magic"><span>Now for the software magic</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6z8YsHrdksXgK2xLaPUMC5" name="Nothing-Phone-3-lens" alt="Nothing teases Phone 3 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6z8YsHrdksXgK2xLaPUMC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But hardware is only a small part of the story. The real secret sauce is the software, which uses a technique called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a>. This is the brain behind the brawn, processing and enhancing the raw data captured by the sensor. The most important technique in this arsenal is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://photographylife.com/night-sky-image-stacking" target="_blank">image stacking</a>.</p><p>When you press the shutter button in night sight mode, your phone doesn't just take one picture. It takes a rapid-fire series of photos, often a dozen or more, in a second or two. These individual photos are all slightly different, some a little underexposed, others slightly overexposed. They all contain a bit of noise, too, but the noise is random and different in each frame. That's important, and means that with enough frames, you can have a clear set of data for everything.</p><p>After capturing these multiple images, the phone's processor gets to work. It aligns all the frames, compensating for any minor hand shake you might have had while holding the phone. Then, it uses a sophisticated algorithm to "stack" them on top of each other.</p><p>By averaging the pixel values of all the aligned images, the random noise that appeared in each individual photo is effectively canceled out, leaving behind a much cleaner, sharper base image. This is a lot like how a student might get a more accurate grade by averaging the scores from multiple tests instead of just one.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-off-to-you-ai"><span>Off to you, AI</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The process doesn't stop there. Once the noise is reduced, the software performs further processing to enhance the final image. It "intelligently" brightens the darker areas of the photo without blowing out the highlights. It also adjusts the contrast and color balance to make the image look more natural and vibrant. This is where different smartphone brands develop their unique "look."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Google's Pixel 9</a>, for example, is known for its strong emphasis on realistic colors and contrast, while other manufacturers like Samsung might opt for a more vibrant, saturated look with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="5pPUTjfPXxFsddsQG6toeN" name="Camera-sample-collage-6" alt="A church at night" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pPUTjfPXxFsddsQG6toeN.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 (top left), Galaxy Z Flip 6 (top right), OPPO Find N5 (bottom left), and Pixel 9 (bottom right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI also helps the software identify objects in the scene, like faces or landscapes, and apply specific optimizations to make them look their best.</p><p>This is why every "night mode" photo you take will look a little bit different. The source may be the same, but there is a bit of wiggle room for the software to process everything. It may slightly change the color, sharpen some areas more than others, and even make the edges of objects slightly different. The end goal is to produce something that meets a set of overall parameters that we like to see.</p><p>The next time you marvel at a stunning night shot from your phone, remember what's happening under the hood. It's not just a lucky shot. It's a complex, multi-step process that starts with an adequate sensor and lens, captures a burst of images, uses powerful software to stack and average them, and then intelligently enhances the final product.</p><p>It's a perfect example of how computational photography has democratized a once-specialized area of photography, allowing everyone to capture beautiful images even when the sun has gone down.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-we-ve-come-a-long-way"><span>We've come a long way</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XjstzTFNrQaNsLNADGnenW" name="Google Pixel 5 camera app.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 5 camera app pointed at a pathway through trees outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjstzTFNrQaNsLNADGnenW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The journey from grainy, unusable night photos to the clear, vibrant images we see today has been a rapid one. Early smartphone cameras were simply not equipped for low-light conditions. Their small sensors and narrow apertures meant they couldn't gather enough light. To compensate, the camera would increase its sensitivity (a setting called ISO), which made the image brighter but introduced a massive amount of noise, turning the photo into a pixelated mess.</p><p>The breakthrough came with the realization that instead of trying to capture a perfect image in a single shot, it was better to use software to combine multiple imperfect shots. This idea, which had been used in professional astrophotography for years, was adapted for the mobile world.</p><p>Google's introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-bringing-pixel-4s-improved-night-sight-3-and-3a">Night Sight on the Pixel 3</a> in 2018 was a landmark moment, popularizing the concept and pushing other manufacturers to develop their own versions. Apple's Night Mode, Samsung's Night Mode, and others all follow a similar principle of computational photography using specialized hardware and custom software.</p><p>These features have fundamentally changed how we think about mobile photography. They've given us the ability to capture moments that were once impossible without a bulky DSLR camera and a tripod.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tips-for-taking-better-night-photos-with-your-phone"><span>Tips for Taking Better Night Photos with Your Phone</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.72%;"><img id="GSGoCnkXcTth4KBg5MwJcR" name="golden-ratio-photography.jpg" alt="The golden ratio depicted on an image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSGoCnkXcTth4KBg5MwJcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="430" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Adobe)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even with all this technology, there are a few simple things you can do to get the best possible night shots.</p><p><strong>Hold Still:</strong> This is the most important tip. Since the phone is taking multiple photos over a few seconds, any movement can cause blur. Find a stable surface to rest your phone on, or simply hold it as still as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Tap to Focus:</strong> Before you press the shutter, tap on the darkest part of the scene to tell the camera where to focus and expose correctly. This will help the phone's algorithm work more effectively.</p><p><strong>Clean Your Lens:</strong> A smudged lens can make a huge difference in low light. A quick wipe with a soft cloth can improve sharpness and reduce glare from light sources.</p><p><strong>Don't Zoom:</strong> Digital zoom is a recipe for a blurry, noisy mess. It's always better to get closer to your subject or crop the photo later.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c69ed741-a4ce-44de-a2f4-59c3bd550ab2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGLzkSSEaGTvsjXvJayfZN.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro official render - Hazel - Front/Back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Night Mode king</strong></em></p><p>Google is known for having excellent low-light and nighttime photography, and the Pixel 9 Pro continues that trend, thanks to the company's excellent computational photography.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The alleged specifications for the base model state consumers could see a similar 50MP main camera, 48MP ultra-wide lens, and an added 48MP telephoto.</p><h2 id="we-re-not-far-now-2">We're not far now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:497px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:120.72%;"><img id="9eiGLUaUkmqGJBKpPaU9Bc" name="google-pixel-10-indigo-rendering-example-leak" alt="A leaked render of the base Pixel 10 phone in "Indigo."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eiGLUaUkmqGJBKpPaU9Bc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="497" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WinFuture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks about the Pixel 10 series' specs have been bubbling up all summer, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">the one from June</a> had a lot to share. Over a month ago, rumors claimed the Pixel 10 Pro XL was on the way with a 6.8-inch display, slightly larger than the Pixel 10 Pro's 6.3-inch screen. As expected, the new series should rock Google's newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chipset, which should bring worthwhile improvements over the minimalistic Tensor G4.</p><p>Charging speeds for the Pro XL is expected to sit around 39W, while its wireless charging could reach 15W. This model is rumored to receive the largest battery in a Pixel phone at 5,200mAh. Elsewhere, it seems the Pro XL model will drop the lowest storage option and find solace in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB variations.</p><p>A week ago, there were rumors about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-series-pricing-leak-staggering-alleged-fold-model">Google's potential pricing</a> for the Pixel 10 series. The Pixel 10 Pro XL might start at $1,199 with its base 256GB variation and end up at around $1,549 for its higher options. Those same rumors allege the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might step its foot directly into the $2,000 range at ~$2,149 for its 1TB.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Made by Google event</a> is on deck for August 20.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first pertains to Instagram's Map feature, which lets users share "their last active location" with their friends. Essentially, users can soon view the Instagram Map and see where their friends are posting new content from. Tapping the DMs icon at the top right of the app and viewing the side-scrolling menu will display the new "Map" icon.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="wVPntoQHFTppa9Kxy4CpKn" name="instagram-maps-update-location-sharing" alt="Instagram Maps lets users see where their friends are in the world through location-sharing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVPntoQHFTppa9Kxy4CpKn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Meta states users can view "location-based" Instagram content by seeing where everyone is on a map (if they're sharing their location). If someone has posted a new Reel, Story, or post, and their location-sharing is active, users will see their circular icon and a thumbnail of their content.</p><p>This content must be "location-tagged" to appear in Instagram Map, and it will remain there for 24 hours. Newly posted Notes will also be available to view from within Maps, so you'll know where they were when they posted them. The feature gives <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-edit-button-teaser-feature-highlights">strong Snapchat vibes</a> back when it rolled out location-sharing and a map for users last year.</p><p>As this rolls out, Meta states location-sharing will be off by default. Moreover, you can decide who you're sharing your location with. Users will see options for "friends" (users who follow you back), Close Friends, Only Selected Friends, and "no one." If you decide to share your location, Meta says your location will only update when you open the app or return to it.</p><p>Instagram Map is rolling out to users in the U.S. today (Aug 6). Instagram previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-share-location-nicknames-dms-update">rolled out a location-sharing feature</a>, but that was only for DMs and lacked a complete map with multiple users.</p><h2 id="even-more-for-reels-2">Even more for Reels</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="D9CSQvAxhCJUHfjUiDJoKn" name="instagram-repost-reels-posts-example" alt="Instagram is rolling out a repost button for Reels and posts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9CSQvAxhCJUHfjUiDJoKn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.71%;"><img id="EdNaPmASLk4GjP47tqjT9m" name="instagram-friends-reels-tab-example" alt="Instagram Reels picks up a new "Friends" tab, letting users see what their friends and family are interacting with on the app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdNaPmASLk4GjP47tqjT9m.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="692" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Like other social media sites (Threads, X), Instagram is finally getting its own "repost" button for posts and Reels.</p><p>The blog post states that when you've reposted a Reel or post, it will be credited to the original user who uploaded said content. However, your icon will be present at the bottom left corner with a purple repost icon, letting your followers know you've shared something new. Meta says this could be a great way for content creators to reach new audiences, as their posts may be recommended more widely.</p><p>Additionally, if you're reposting something, Instagram will give you a small speech bubble to tag a note along with it.</p><p>The Reels update doesn't end there, as Instagram is finally rolling out its new "Friends" tab globally. Through this tab, Meta says users can find the Reels their friends have either posted or interacted with in some way. Recommendations via your "Blend" with a friend will appear in this new tab, too.</p><p>This tab will be placed at the top of Reels. Instagram highlights new controls for users for the Friends tab, such as the ability to hide your likes and comments.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's been nearly two years since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> launched in late August 2023, and it's still arguably Garmin's best all-around smartwatch that athletes can reasonably afford. Given that, the Garmin Venu 4 has high standards to meet and the potential to excite or disappoint fans in equal measure.</p><p>Garmin itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/first-signs-of-venu-4-coming-soon-garmin-japan-drops-a-clue/">leaked the Venu 4 name</a> in a description of the Japanese Garmin golf app, saying it would get premium golf features that the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Garmin Venu X1</a> received earlier this year.</p><p>Otherwise, we don't <em>officially </em>know anything about this watch. But we can look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-vs-venu-3">Venu X1 upgrades over the Venu 3</a> — plus the pricier Fenix 8 and Venu-lite Vivoactive 6 — and get a pretty good idea of what tricks the Venu 4 will receive to refresh the Venu 3 template.</p><p>Here's everything we expect from the Venu 4, along with everything we truly <em>hope</em> Garmin will add, even if the odds are slim.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-most-likely-garmin-venu-4-features"><span>The most likely Garmin Venu 4 features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu 3's ECG app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 4 should emulate the Venu 3 with two AMOLED touch display sizes (1.2 and 1.4 inches), a mic & speaker, all-systems GNSS tracking (but no dual-band GPS), an altimeter for elevation data, a gyroscope for accurate workout tracking, music storage, Garmin Pay, and at least the 5th-generation Elevate sensor with ECG and skin temp readings.</p><p>It should bring back the core Garmin health and training tools like Body Battery, Sleep Coach, intensity minutes, workout benefit, recovery time, animated indoor workouts, running dynamics, running power, and more recent add-ons like Garmin Strength Coach.</p><p>Since the Venu 3 came out, Garmin has continued to update its core UI, and the Venu 4 will have a smarter, more logical navigation layout than the last model. Beyond that, the Venu 4 is due to receive a ton of new features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EkFQpAWf9mHKgkxUzDdyVB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-16" alt="Workout summary on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EkFQpAWf9mHKgkxUzDdyVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Vivoactive 6 with training effect on a brighter AMOLED display </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> is designed as a cheaper Venu alternative, but since it came out later, it introduced features the Venu 4 is nearly 100% certain to get: move alerts, daily walking suggestions, Garmin Run Coach, prebuilt cycling plans, PacePro, training effect, and the smart alarm that waits to wake you until you're in a light sleep stage.</p><p>Plus, the Vivoactive 6 display — like the Venu X1 and Forerunner 970 displays — is twice as bright as most AMOLED Garmin watches; expect the Venu 4 to hit 2,000 nits, as well.</p><p>The Garmin Venu 3 was one of the first Garmin watches to add a mic & speaker, but it only works for Bluetooth calling and pass-through commands to your phone. Since then, several watches like the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> have added on-watch commands like "Start a run activity" or "Show my sleep summary." It's a guarantee the Venu 4 gets these commands.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-everything-we-hope-the-garmin-venu-4-will-add"><span>Everything we hope the Garmin Venu 4 will add</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yETApyW9rAVbjwmfvyWYcV" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-flashlight" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 sitting on an armrest, pointed toward the camera with the flashlight on." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yETApyW9rAVbjwmfvyWYcV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu X1's flashlight </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, if the Garmin Venu 4 adds all of the above features, that'll be enough to satisfy plenty of people. And the more features Garmin adds, the more justification it will have to raise the Venu 4 price, just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> and Forerunner 570 jumped $50 and $100 in price, respectively.</p><p>But if Garmin is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">determined to charge more</a>, we may as well get even more new features out of the Venu 4! Here's what we want to see, from reasonable possibilities to unlikely hopes.</p><h2 id="a-flashlight-2">A flashlight</h2><p>In the last year, the Fenix 8, Enduro 3, Forerunner 970, Venu X1, and Instinct 3 have all added built-in LED flashlights, though not the Vivoactive 6. The fact that the $550 Forerunner 570 <em>didn't</em> get the flashlight could mean that Garmin reserves this for the top-tier models (and Instinct series built for outdoor use), but it could be a way for Garmin to differentiate this mainline model from other smartwatches, with a feature that's quite popular among Garmin users.</p><h2 id="more-forerunner-training-tools-2">More Forerunner training tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="K4QXox3Mu7xdF8YLoCwWgJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-acute-load" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on an armrest, showing the Acute Load widget chart with Optimal range of training load." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K4QXox3Mu7xdF8YLoCwWgJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin avoids adding overly complicated Forerunner training tools to the Venu series, where they might overwhelm new users. But the Garmin Venu X1 received nearly all the same training features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, as Garmin couldn't reasonably charge $800 <em>without</em> including them.</p><p>The pricier the Venu 4 gets, the harder it'll be to justify excluding certain tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> and training readiness. Most runners and hikers will go for Forerunners and Instincts, but those who will trade extra buttons for a more stylish design still deserve this data, and indoor athletes will benefit from training load data, too.</p><h2 id="breadcrumb-navigation-2">Breadcrumb navigation</h2><p>The Garmin Venu 4 will never get offline maps when the Instinct 3 and Forerunner 570 didn't; it's a frustrating fact that Garmin reserves maps for premium models, even though other brands offer maps on cheap watches.</p><p>What's more surprising is that the Venu 3 doesn't even have point-to-point navigation, so you can't follow a course and see how far you are from your destination. Even if most Venu fans will never use GPX courses, and it's not a priority for an indoor-focused watch, some users will definitely benefit from this.</p><h2 id="elevate-v6-with-new-health-data-2">Elevate v6 with new health data</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E7ixHzpgpwKsPJexu9UwZ" name="Garmin-Venu-3-sensors.jpeg" alt="A bottom view of the Garmin Venu 3, showing the new Elevate v5 heart rate sensor and the Quick Release watch bands with their sliding pins." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E7ixHzpgpwKsPJexu9UwZ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-review">Garmin Venu 2</a> was the first model with the Elevate v4 sensor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-plus-review">Venu 2 Plus</a> introduced ECG readings, and the Venu 3 was one of the first — after the Fenix 7 Pro — to use the current Elevate v5 sensor with skin temperature. I don't know if Garmin has a new sensor suite ready, but the Venu 4 is a candidate to introduce the 6th-generation version.</p><p>The most obvious upgrade would be additional LEDs for better HR accuracy, but I'm also hoping for new health data. Garmin has patented a method to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">track glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)</a> for a "long-term indication of the average blood glucose level." More recently, its "pulse spectroscopy" patent discussed ways to track your body's hydration and hemocrit levels. There's no guarantee Garmin will use these patents, but it's an example of how Garmin is looking to expand its health offerings.</p><h2 id="daily-indoor-workout-recommendations-2">Daily indoor workout recommendations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-18" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 daily workout suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 4 will get the new Garmin Strength Coach for a guided, weeks-long training plan, as well as premade strength, HIIT, cardio, yoga, and pilates workouts. But not everyone likes to follow a rigid, long-term plan; I personally prefer Garmin's daily run suggestions to its structured Run Coach. With daily cycling and walking suggestions available, too, I think daily indoor workout suggestions are the natural next step!</p><p>I'm not sure of the logistics of how they pull this off, as there are so many different types of indoor workouts based on your equipment and abilities. Maybe it'd end up being some kind of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus feature</a>. Either way, it'd help the Venu 4 compete against the Apple Watch with its curated list of Fitness+ video workouts.</p><h2 id="cellular-data-2">Cellular data</h2><p>I've been waiting for Garmin to get back into selling LTE watches since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, which solely used it for safety check-ins. The Garmin Venu 4, like the kid-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a>, could go beyond that and offer 4G LTE calling or voice message check-ins to Garmin LiveTrack.</p><p>To be clear, I'd want this to be an optional add-on, just as you can pay extra for LTE-capable Apple and Galaxy Watches. The point is that this would be extremely appealing for those who want a phone backup or phone-free workout experience, whether outdoors or at the gym. The current rumor is that Garmin will sell a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/garmin-may-be-adding-huge-lte-upgrade-to-the-fenix-8-smartwatch-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Fenix 8 Pro with LTE</a>, so that's a more likely candidate, but who knows!</p><h2 id="an-even-skinnier-design-2">An even skinnier design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-side-view-buttons" alt="A side angle of the Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the photo angled to show the two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin Venu 3 is one of the most stylish <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> out there, with a cool steel bezel and svelte case. The Venu X1 isn't nearly as stylish, but I'll admit that its 40g, 7.9mm case is very comfortable to wear, both for workouts and at home. I'm hoping that Garmin can make the Venu 4 a little more petite while preserving its two-week battery life. That might be an unfair request, but I'll hope for it regardless.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1f15ac11-b603-45d2-a9a1-640139247b15">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3.jpg' alt="Render of the Black Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu X1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Next-level</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Venu X1 features a brand-new ultra-thin design while building on Garmin's excellent Venyu lineup with features like a large OLED display, long battery life, a built-in flashlight, Garmin's excellent fitness tracking features, and much more.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's repository suggests the device will launch with four watch band colors and three main body 41mm variations. Those colors are as follows: Iris (silver body), Lemongrass (brass body), Porcelain, and Obsidian (obsidian body).</p><p>For its 45mm version, the tipster alleges a Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>The supposed renders of the Pixel Watch 4 are another major talking point of this rumor. The tipster's images showcase the device straight on, which seems to highlight its thinner bezels. Aside from that, the rest of the device is relatively similar to what we've seen for the past three iterations. The Pixel Watch 4 is still rumored to feature a physical button on its right side with its rotating crown.</p><p>These leaked renders don't give us a good look at its altered back panel, nor the rumored "side-mounted" charging on its left side.

The render highlighted a chance for the device to be placed in a new "cradle" (or whatever they'll call it) to charge while standing on its side. If true, it'll make the Pixel Watch 4 seem like a mini Google Home, as you'll be able to see its clock during its power-up cycle.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 could also see a slight indentation on its left side with two charging pins to go with this newly developed charger.</p><p>We've been wondering about the Pixel Watch 4's charging ever since an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">initial batch of leaked renders</a> completely left out its necessary pins. While some figured wireless charging was on the way, it seems we might be headed in a new direction. Also, aside from thinner bezels for its domed-glass display, the Pixel Watch 4 is reportedly thicker, possibly indicating a bigger battery.</p><p>The Made by Google event is slated for August 20, where we should see the Pixel Watch 4 alongside the Pixel 10 series and more. This week's rumors claim the watch might also hit the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad">price similar to the Watch 3</a>, too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's also up to $725 of trade-in credit up for grabs (in the form of an Amazon gift card), so consider sending in your old phone to score some additional savings. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVHV7X53" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6069d00d-1b51-4a3c-88a7-0b81e56224f5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful smartphone that won&apos;t break the bank; you want a device with great battery life, cameras, and seven years of guaranteed software support. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a phone with expandable storage; you suffer from PWM sensitivity; you can afford to spend a bit more on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Google Pixel 9a is basically the perfect example of a midrange masterpiece. Starting at $499 for the 128GB configuration, the device sports a bold design with IP68 ingress protection, a brilliant 6.3-inch pOLED display, and some of the best battery life found on any Pixel phone to date. </p><p>You also get exceptional cameras for the price, flagship-level performance from the Tensor G4 chipset, and 8GB of RAM as standard. And of course, like the majority of the best phones released this year, the Google Pixel 9a guarantees seven years of OS and security upgrades.  </p><p>Sure, the Pixel 9a&apos;s charging is a bit slow and on-board AI features are limited, but these are small sacrifices when you consider the overall bang for the buck offered here. Thanks to this Pixel 9a Amazon deal, you&apos;re paying $400 less than you would for the base model Google Pixel 9 while enjoying a mostly indistinguishable experience. Feel free to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">compare the two phones</a> to learn more, but if you&apos;re looking for a student-friendly smartphone today, this might be the best deal on the web. </p> ]]></dc:content>

We're expecting it to have a design similar to the current model with slight tweaks to the outer display's size, hopefully better cameras, and a new Tensor G5 SoC.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is its biggest competitor, Honor recently launched a pretty formidable rival too.</p><p>The Honor Magic V5 is yet to make its way to more markets globally, but it's one stunning-looking foldable. It's incredibly slim and light, is powered by Qualcomm's finest silicon, and it features a massive battery with very fast wired and wireless charging. All this at a price that's going to be lower than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold makes it a tempting alternative. When both phones do hit global markets, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> should you consider buying?</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1664px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NB3qAgPNtPhFoym7d4HJmV" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero-alt" alt="The Honor Magic V5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NB3qAgPNtPhFoym7d4HJmV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1664" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the leaked renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> show that the design may not be too different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. We should expect similar levels of thickness, too, which is 5.1mm when unfolded and 10.5mm when folded. Compared to the Magic V5, it's likely going to be more of a handful for sure. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold weighed 257 grams, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should weigh about the same, if not a bit heavier. We don't see it competing with Honor in the weight department either.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Magic V5</a> looks absolutely stunning thanks to its incredibly slim design. The prominent curvature along the edges, subtle curves and raised edges around the camera module, and four stunning colors make the V5 a thing of beauty. Despite packing massive displays and a large battery, it weighs just 217 grams and unfolds to a thickness of just 4.1mm. Those are some bonkers specs right there. Instead of glass, Honor uses an aerospace fibre for the back panel, which keeps the weight down and improves durability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-top-bottom" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which shows off its full internal display and rear camera housing, which hosts three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic V5 boasts of two impressive AMOLED displays. There's a 6.43-inch outer screen and a 7.95-inch folding one. Both support LTPO 120Hz refresh rates, up to 5,000 nits of peak brightness, and an incredibly high 4,320Hz PWM dimming rate. The phone even supports the Honor Magic Pen on both displays, offering up to 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, similar to Samsung's S Pen.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to come with a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover screen with possibly higher peak brightness of around 3,000 nits. The phone may feature an 8-inch folding display with the same peak brightness level, but an appallingly low PWM dimming rate, which is not good if your eyes are sensitive to flicker.</p><p>Rumors also point to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold being the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/this-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leak-is-as-good-as-it-gets">first foldable phone to feature an IP68 water and dust resistance rating</a>, which would be impressive.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero" alt="The Honor Magic V5 in Dawn Gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic V5 hasn't hit the U.S. yet, but it has launched in Malaysia for MYR 6,999 (roughly $1,655). Same goes for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which hasn't officially launched yet, but we expect it to start at around $1,799 like the previous model. Both are costly phones, but the Pixel will most likely be easier to buy in most parts of the world, and should also have better after-sales support.</p><p>In terms of core specs, there's plenty of RAM and storage options for the Honor Magic V5, and even the 10 Pro Fold is expected to get a 1TB variant this time. Honor uses Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC in its foldable, which has proven to be very reliable, powerful, and power-efficient.

We've not tested either phone yet, but the specs are heavily in Honor's favor. The V5 has a 5,820mAh battery, which is positively huge for such a slim foldable.</p><p>There's also very quick charging, like 66W wired and 50W. The Pixel is expected to have a larger battery than before, at 5,015mAh, and slightly faster wired charging at 25W, which is not even close to what the Magic V5 offers. Wireless charging speeds might still remain the same at 7.5W.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold didn't have impressive cameras, as the hardware was reused from the original Fold. This time, Google should bring the camera hardware up to speed too (we hope), which should give it a stronger fighting chance. The Magic V5, on the other hand, comes with some impressive camera hardware on paper, like a 50MP main sensor, 64MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP ultrawide. Even the selfie cameras on the outer and inner screens are 20MP each, which is higher than what Google might offer.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-multi-tasking-menu-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="New multi-tasking context menu in Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbrBEuPwP6RdkBtdUXNfmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold should ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and would also get seven years of software updates, which would include OS upgrades and security patches. Meanwhile, the Magic V5 runs MagicOS 9, which is based on Android 15. It's unclear how many OS revisions this phone will receive over the years. In terms of staying up to date with software, the Pixel is always going to be a safer choice.</p><p>The Magic V5 runs Gemini and comes with its own custom AI suite. There's AI Call Translation and AI Deepfake Detection, and Honor Share, which works with even iOS and Mac devices. Along with Gemini, there's Honor's own AI assistant called YONO, although this might be exclusive to the Chinese version of the phone.</p><p>We don't know yet what exclusive AI features will be offered with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but rest assured that there will be many.

It should cost roughly the same as the Pixel when it does launch in more markets, but before snagging one, keep in mind that long-term software support, AI features, and serviceability probably won't be as good as the Pixel.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="893e4499-b5fd-4b6c-b0b5-9db8977c62a3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6XUdMt74rbUjvCdi83z3Nf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Official Render - Porcelain - Folded"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>More refined</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is coming in August, and it's going to have some big upgrades over the 9 Pro Fold.

This year, we were graced with a new "classic" Wear OS watch from Samsung, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.  It slightly breaks from tradition, moving to a squircle case while retaining its circular screen and satisfying rotating bezel.</p><p>There is a lot about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic that screams vintage, but the new modern touches might not be well-received by Classic fans. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel Watch has historically been a very modern-feeling smartwatch. Will the polarizing Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic be enough to push buyers toward the upcoming Pixel Watch 4? Let's review how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">great smartwatches</a> might compare based on current rumors and leaks.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vEBkN4jNP5ezATouUpFS88" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-vs-Watch-6-Classic-design" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) sitting aside one another, the photo angled to focus on their rotating bezels and thickness from the bottom-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vEBkN4jNP5ezATouUpFS88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event set for August 20</a>, and that's where we'll see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> for the first time. The smartwatch will debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 series</a> and a new Pixel Buds model. It's expected to be released in two sizes, and the Pixel Watch 4 may follow the same pricing tiers as the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>In case you're curious, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> was announced on August 13, 2024, but you couldn't buy it until September 10, 2024. It's unclear how much time will pass between the Pixel Watch 4's official announcement and public release date this time around, with rumors pointing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues">another long delay this year</a>.</p><p>A recent leak suggested that there won't be a price hike for the Pixel Watch 4 in Europe, and that should be music to everyone's ears. If pricing remains the same globally, you'll pay $349 for the 41mm model and $399 for the 45mm model. LTE versions would cost another $100 on top of that. It's always possible that Google raises the price due to inflation and other supply chain factors, but early signs are positive.</p><p>Samsung released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> on July 25, and it's now publicly available. It's only available in one 46mm case size that retails for $499. That's more than the previous Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. It's also priced higher than rumors expect the Pixel Watch 4 to cost. You can get the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in white or black colorways.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung and Google now both have their own unique smartwatch design languages. It'll be up to you to decide which one you prefer. Google has the "waterdrop" chassis for the Pixel Watch, where the display glass flows right into the case like a water droplet. Meanwhile, Samsung is sticking with the "cushion" shape for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, where you get a circular display atop a squircle case.</p><p>Regardless of how you feel about each style, there's no doubt they're distinct. Google is expected to keep the same general design language on the Pixel Watch 4, albeit with slimmer bezels. Rumors point to the Google Pixel Watch 4 being thicker than the Pixel Watch 3, possibly by about 2 millimeters. That could put the Pixel Watch 4 above 14mm thick, which is somewhat alarming — the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is only 10.6mm thick.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Heritage-Classic-watch-face" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a woman's wrist showing the Heritage Classic watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's true even after accounting for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's physical rotating bezel. It's used for navigation, giving users a satisfying way to control the watch while limiting the number of display touches needed for each action.</p><p>Notably, if you like a smaller watch, you'll probably need to go with the upcoming Pixel Watch 4. Samsung did away with offering the Classic watch in multiple sizes; the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has a 46mm case size. Google does a better job supporting multiple sizes, and the Pixel Watch 4 could come in 41mm and 45mm cases, just like its predecessor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-04" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Believe it or not, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's display size is expected to fall right in the middle of the Pixel Watch 4 size options. Samsung's watch sports a 1.34-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 438x438 resolution, and it now supports a 3,000-nit peak brightness rating. The squircle chassis and rotating bezel take up a lot of space; thus, the larger case size actually has a smaller screen.</p><p>The rumored 45mm size of the Google Pixel Watch 4 should pack a bigger display measuring around 1.43 inches. If the company is indeed slimming the bezels, the screen could be even larger. On the smaller variant, there may be a display measuring roughly 1.27 inches. Both AMOLED screens should support at least a 2,000-nit peak brightness rating and offer a 60Hz variable refresh rate.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xCUdrNg2eUs9U7VvHkncuK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-post-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the post-run results from a track workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCUdrNg2eUs9U7VvHkncuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, both Wear OS smartwatches are likely packed with wearable processors and a slew of health sensors. Samsung just updated its watches with new BioActive sensors and Exynos W1000 processors last year, and they both carry over to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. Google may be due for an upgrade, and there are rumors that the Pixel Watch 4 could be powered by a new Qualcomm chipset for wearables, but it's unclear if one will be ready in time.</p><p>That mysterious processor is expected to be the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, a chip that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">recently started appearing in leaks</a>. Previously, our own wearable expert Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">spoke to Qualcomm VP of wearables Dino Bekis</a> about the partnership between Qualcomm and Google. At the time, Bekis teased the "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" Snapdragon Wear chipset set to arrive "next year" (2025).</p><p>It would stand to reason that a new Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 platform is coming, and the Pixel Watch 4 could be one of the first wearables to use it. Google could ship the Pixel Watch 4 with 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage, aligning with prior models. However, Samsung bumped up the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's onboard storage to 64GB this year, keeping the memory at 2GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4 (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Gold, Lemon, Porcelain, Iris, and Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td><td  ><p>Hybrid</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown, possibly 14.3mm thick</p></td><td  ><p>46.4mm x 46mm x 10.6 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>63.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td><td  ><p>1.34-inch Super AMOLED, 438x438 pixels resolution</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>2,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade), GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td><td  ><p>LTE (optional), Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4+5GHz, NFC, L1+L5 dual-frequency GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td><td  ><p>BioActive sensor (Optical + Electrical Heart Signal + BIA), Temperature, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro, Geomagnetic, Light, 3D Hall</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/420mAh</p></td><td  ><p>445mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Fast Charging (WPC-based wireless)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 (or Gen 2)</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos W1000</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 64GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (One UI 8 Watch) with four years of software updates through 2029</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Battery capacity is expected to remain the same between the Pixel Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 4, with the 41mm model landing somewhere around 306mAh and the 45mm reaching roughly 420mAh. With that being said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> and the possibility of a new chip could combine to squeeze more battery life out of similar cells.</p><p>Regardless of what Google does, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic should have a bigger battery. At 445mAh, the smartwatch's battery capacity is enough to get you through around a day or two on a full charge. The exact figure depends on whether you keep the always-on display enabled and how many GPS workouts you track.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-fitness-and-health-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Fitness and health</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="pqKhBJ4NB98uAS67rU225T" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-level-outside" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic worn on a wrist outside, the display showing "Your running level" and a stylized orange number 7 underneath." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqKhBJ4NB98uAS67rU225T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung helped usher in a new era for Wear OS smartwatches with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. It runs Wear OS 6 out of the box, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-new-gemini-wear-os-app-on-galaxy-watch-8-improvements-and-problems">features Gemini as the standard voice assistant</a> instead of Google Assistant. It's using a One UI 8 Watch skin, so the entire operating system will feel familiar if you're a One UI user. In addition to Gemini, you'll also get Galaxy AI and Samsung Health integration on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>The new model includes a few new health tricks, like tracking your antioxidant index and serving as your custom Running Coach. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also includes now-standard features like heart rate monitoring, ECG support, blood-oxygen monitoring, and temperature detection. Basically, the BioActive sensor here will have all your health and sleep tracking needs covered.</p><p>Google will likely ship the Pixel Watch 4 with Wear OS 6 and Gemini support, too. It should also bring along the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive redesign</a>, something that's exclusive to Pixel wearables. We don't know exactly what health features Google has in store for the Pixel Watch 4, but they'll build on existing tools such as heart rate monitoring, ECG support, blood-oxygen monitoring, cEDA sensing, and temperature detection.</p><p>It's also said to include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-strength-training">new fitness-focused features</a> such as a workout builder, activity tracking, and more, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/the-pixel-watch-4-would-be-my-go-to-fitness-smartwatch-if-google-added-this-feature">could appeal to more than just runners</a>.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-which-will-be-best-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Which will be best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this stage, we can't say for sure what upgrades the Google Pixel Watch 4 will bring, but they have the potential to be major. Slimmer bezels, a new processor, and more battery life would be massive upgrades for the Pixel Watch 4. Google AI and Gemini tools tailor-made for the Pixel Watch could change the way you interact with the device on your wrist.</p><p>Rumors and leaks paint a lofty picture, but we'll have to wait for the Google Pixel Watch 4 to be officially revealed to know for sure. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is certainly the more well-known quantity, as it already sports Wear OS 6 and Gemini. The hardware bezel for navigation and the squircle shape are two Galaxy Watch 8 Classic characteristics that Google likely won't replicate. If they sound intriguing, you may want to pick up the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic now instead of waiting for the Pixel Watch 4.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a040dfc7-37eb-498b-8a28-119389983546">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hwpo62ispznxtyGMcGNc9L.jpg' alt="The leaked Pixel Watch 4 render against a white background.

Like other Fan Edition phones, it will offer key flagship features from the main S series lineup, but at a more affordable price.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly targeting an earlier-than-usual launch due to concerns over U.S. tariffs. The company also appears to be capitalizing on the strong momentum of the Galaxy S25 series in its home market.

The agents are available in preview starting today, Aug. 5, including a GitHub Actions helper for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-cli-debuts-open-source-ai-agent">Gemini command-line interface (CLI)</a>.</p><p>The company says the fresh AI tools are the start of an agentic enterprise for its customers, which aims to bridge the operational and analytical needs of a business. Alongside the agentic helpers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-giving-openai-more-computing-power-to-keep-up-with-everyones-ai-cravings">Google Cloud</a> is creating Gemini Data Agents APIs and the Agent Development Kit (ADK), which are the foundation for a customizable platform that can be used to create custom AI tools for unique workflows.</p><p>These are the new AI agents developers and businesses can try out now in Google Cloud:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Engineering Agent in BigQuery</strong> — a data-prepping agent optimized for cleaning, transforming, and preparing information for AI use.</li><li><strong>Data Science Agent in BigQuery Notebooks</strong> — a workspace agent that turns notebooks into intelligent infrastructure for data science teams.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics Agent + Code Interpreter</strong> — a chatbot-style tool that supports conversational question-and-answer dialogue using the context of unique data sets.</li><li><strong>Migration Agent for Spanner </strong>— a data modernization agent designed for Google Cloud's global database service, Spanner.</li><li><strong>Conversational Analytics API</strong> — a custom agent builder for developers and businesses.</li><li><strong>Gemini CLI GitHub Actions</strong> — a coding teammate for your GitHub repository, found in Gemini CLI.</li></ul><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-s-new-ai-agents-2">Everything you need to know about Google's new AI agents</h2><p>Google Cloud is for businesses, first-and-foremost, and these AI agents are intended to help with everything from software development and data analytics to managing global distribution and infrastructure networks. For example, the Data Engineering Agent can automate workflows that were once manual processes. It supports data ingestion from external sources, like Google Cloud Storage, and can complete contextual actions on your behalf.</p><p>Google provides the example prompt of "Create a pipeline to load a CSV file, cleanse these columns, and join it with another table." With that, the Data Engineering Agent can complete the multi-action requests independently. The Spanner Migration Agent can work in tandem with the Data Engineering Agent, as it's intended for legacy systems that are still needing modernization.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2444px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.34%;"><img id="vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A" name="Google-Data-Science-Agent" alt="The data science agent in Google Cloud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vy9A6Sq8X4e83VJDSvix5A.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2444" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Data Science Agent can automate typical analytical workflows, according to Google. It handles common tasks like exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, featurization, and machine learning predictions based on provided data sets in either BigQuery or Vertex AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1176px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.92%;"><img id="ExKhJPFB79SdDzAJCim2RT" name="Conversational Analytics + Code Interpreter - July 2025" alt="Conversational analytics agent in Google Cloud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExKhJPFB79SdDzAJCim2RT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1176" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Conversational Analytics Agent is also getting a boost, as it's now getting a Code Interpreter function. It receives thorough and specific natural language questions, and automatically converts them into Python code. From there, Code Interpreter can run the generated code, creating visual and interactive graphics based on the results. It's all running in Google Data Cloud, and thus the company claims it's secure and governed.</p><h2 id="gemini-cli-is-getting-better-for-teams-with-github-actions-2">Gemini CLI is getting better for teams with GitHub Actions</h2><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> CLI is getting an upgrade that enhances multi-user support and GitHub integration. For those unfamiliar, Gemini CLI is a command-line terminal for Gemini that's open-source and can be run locally. It's available in beta globally now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The story behind Gemini CLI's new GitHub Actions agent is pretty interesting. Amidst a heavy burden of GitHub feature requests and contributions for the open-source Gemini CLI, Google needed a way to respond quickly at scale. So, it created GitHub Actions — an autonomous agent that can handle issue triage and pull request reviews independently. Now, it's giving away what it created to manage Gemini CLI issues and contributions as GitHub Actions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.50%;"><img id="q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F" name="Looker MCP Server + Gemini CLI" alt="GitHub Actions running in Gemini CLI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4gu89pgDnnY9pftiMga5F.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="923" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from issue triage and pulling request reviews, GitHub Actions also serves as a collaborative coding agent that can work as your AI teammate.</p><p>All of these Google Cloud features are available in preview or beta starting today, and you can try them now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The screen was fast enough to run all my normal apps, and the processor was even fast enough to play modern games. The only problem was that, while it was the size of a phone, it didn't have support for SIM cards, so it was ultimately just a tiny Kindle in disguise.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>While Onyx released a follow-up device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">a year later</a>, it still didn't include SIM support. Thankfully, Bigme has answered the call and created the HiBreak Pro, a device that not only is the same size as the Palma but also features an <em>even better</em> E Ink display, haptic motors, and, most importantly, a dual-SIM tray.</p><p>While most E Ink phones seem to focus on being "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">minimalist phones</a>," the Bigme HiBreak Pro tosses that idea in the trash and, instead, works exactly like the Android phone you're probably already using. The big difference is that it has a Kindle-like E Ink display that makes daily reading a joy. Plus, it's so much easier on your eyes since you can turn the backlight completely off with the click of a button.</p><p>I took the HiBreak Pro on vacation with me last week and have continued using it for an additional couple of days, and I still can't believe this phone is real. It's a dream come true for anyone trying to avoid the negative effects of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> or is just trying to get away from staring at a backlit screen all day, all without trying to take away all the apps and experiences you love on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="different-from-the-rest-2">Different from the rest</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n" name="e-ink-phones-bigme-hibreak-pro-minimal-phone-mudita-kompakt" alt="A Mudita Kompakt, Minimal Phone, and Bigme HiBreak Pro next to each other on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkH9VaYNStqK5iEcU7j93n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've used several E Ink phones up until now, and all of them seem to suffer from one big issue or another. I compared the Minimal Phone and the Mudita Kompakt <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">back in April</a> because both phones aim to provide a more minimalist experience to cure your digital addiction. While this is admirable, it's extraordinarily difficult for many people to stop using apps, social media, NFC payments, and other modern necessities.</p><p>I say 'necessities' because, try as I might, someone like me can't use a minimalist phone daily and still perform my job effectively. If you fall into this category but still want the eye-friendly experience created by an E Ink display, the Bigme HiBreak Pro is your only viable option on the market. That sounds like you'll be compromising, but the reality is that you really won't.</p><p>The only real "downside" to the phone is that the display is black and white only. It doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">color E Ink</a> like some of Bigme's other devices, although that version is supposedly in the works for a later release. Instead, it uses a lovely 6.13-inch E Ink screen with a very fast refresh rate; <em>much </em>faster than the one on the Minimal Phone or Mudita Kompakt, and it makes a world of difference in daily use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-youtube-video" alt="Watching a Zelda Tears of the Kingdom video on the YouTube app, running on a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUiuRrSDyPXeQinQa7S8q9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching videos on a black and white screen is a bit strange, but people did it less than a hundred years ago, so it just takes some getting used to. Even the contrast is good enough for most videos, although darker videos are just plain hard to see on any E Ink device I've used to date.</p><p>Apps and all normal smartphone functions work as you would expect. Want to launch the camera quickly? Double-click the power button and take the shot. Want to toggle the backlight so you're not wasting power during the day?

That, of course, defeats the purpose of going E Ink as it'll just give you the temptation to use the other phone to doomscroll or revert to old habits.</p><p>It's actually quite weird to see pictures being taken on this phone, only to see it in full color on another device later and be surprised by the quality. The Bigme HiBreak Pro's camera was good enough that I didn't feel the need to find something else for regular photos, and that is enough for me to give it some kind of award.</p><h2 id="getting-e-ink-right-2">Getting E Ink right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cdy9ijtvt8WMbtNeuAFVSQ" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-camera" alt="Taking a picture of a cat using a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdy9ijtvt8WMbtNeuAFVSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my biggest annoyances with E Ink devices is having to constantly change the display mode to best fit the content. Most modern E Ink devices do a decent job in the default display mode, but a lot of apps require you to tweak the image to get the best picture.</p><p>So far, I've <em>never</em> had to adjust the display mode on the Bigme HiBreak Pro. It understands how to tune it for the app that's running, and that's been a huge quality of life change I didn't expect. The only thing I adjust manually is the brightness level because I like control over the backlight, but even then, you could just set it to automatic and let it do its thing like normal.</p><p>Compared to every other E Ink device I have, this one rarely has to do that jarring full refresh cycle you probably associate with E Ink devices. Scrolling through a web page or even a long email looks like a normal display, and it's proof to me that Bigme's software is doing something better than its competitors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3MkwVf6crxJaFmSwGEbij" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-reading-02" alt="Reading a book on a Bigme HiBreak Pro E Ink smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3MkwVf6crxJaFmSwGEbij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the topic of software, while I found the default home screen launcher to be a bit underwhelming, I haven't had any issues changing it to something better, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher">Niagara Launcher</a>.

I tried to use the phone without this case for a while, but found it to be way too slippery. Thankfully, Bigme includes a silicone case in the box if you don't like the overly slippery plastic build. This case is extremely grippy and offers some decent padding for the device, which further adds to the value of the package.</p><p>While a fully polycarbonate phone sounds like a negative, I actually enjoyed the fact that there's zero possibility of breaking the screen if you drop it. That's a weirdly freeing reality in a world where most phones are some kind of metal and glass sandwich.</p><p>Overall, I <em>loved</em> using this phone and even found that, even while Bigme doesn't market this as a "minimalist phone," per se, the black & white E Ink display swayed me away from mindless scrolling I'm seldom prone to doing. To me, this is the ideal way to switch to an E Ink device without feeling the shellshock most other similar products create.</p><p>And, if you were wondering, yes, this display is completely flicker-free. No PWM dimming. No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a>.

One can only speculate, but I've been working in this industry long enough that I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect in the coming weeks. Let's discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Like I mentioned above, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is likely to be revealed during an announcement event on August 20th with a keynote address scheduled for 10am PT. </p><p>Alongside the foldable, we're also set to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro</a>, plus Google is expected to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> and Pixel Buds 2A. Some rumors have even suggested that the company will be formally announcing the release of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>, but the validity of that rumor is far from certain. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF" name="android-16-qpr-beta-1-home-screen-pixel-9-pro-fold-2" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 home screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgLGN6ffKxpzHiEBeJY7qF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for specs, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to feature a 6.4-inch OLED cover display with an 8-inch OLED inner display. Both screens are expected to boast 3,000 nits of peak brightness, plus Google is reportedly working on a new-and-improved hinge that should make the phone a bit thinner and nicer to hold. Considering the ultra-sleek new design found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (the Fold's biggest competitor), this is probably a smart move on Google's part. </p><p>Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to sport the same Tensor G5 chipset that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/10 Pro XL will use, plus rumors have suggested that the phone will feature an upgraded 5,015mAh battery. You'll also get 16GB of RAM as standard and storage variants up to 1TB. We're also expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to come with IP68 ingress protection, which would be an industry first!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-11.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold with Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 in leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rjDMuoASB4nmdPX5tR2p7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what about the price? Well, looking at the competition, it's worth mentioning that both of Samsung's new foldable phones received considerable price increases, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 clocking in at a ridiculous $1,999.99. Last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, on the other hand, had a starting price of $1,799.99.</p><p>Will Google follow the way of its competitors and up the price of the Pixel 10 series? It's hard to know for sure, but at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/could-we-be-the-reason-for-google-increasing-its-phone-prices">one rumor</a> has suggested that Google might actually <em>decrease </em>the starting price of its flagship foldable by $200. Only time will tell, but I wouldn't start celebrating just yet. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-get-a-price-drop"><span>Will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold get a price drop?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdQPMvzaW7dKx6bnWfZJTP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: <strong>will the Pixel 9 Pro Fold finally get cheaper when the next generation arrives?</strong> Since there's no way to know for certain, we have to look at the past to make an educated guess.</p><p>The phone that came before the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold was simply called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. This foldable dropped in 2023 with a $1,799 price tag, and although it's a little hard to find nowadays, you can actually buy the Google Pixel Fold for as little as $989.99 nowadays through stores like Amazon and Best Buy. But of course, this is nearly three years after the device's launch, and I'm guessing you'd rather not wait that long to pick up the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Instead, I'd recommend waiting for a major sale event, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide">Back to School 2025</a> or the upcoming Black Friday sales. By that time, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be considered last-gen, but most stores will still have stock that they're looking to ditch. After all, at this very moment you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p"><strong>get $500 off the phone at Best Buy</strong></a>, and the Pixel 10 version hasn't even been announced yet. Give it a few more weeks and I wouldn't be surprised if last year's foldable dropped to $1,000 or less. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5efc47ab-f503-445f-a7d7-dc9e79d7b75d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JissherrZpkPfUPoRgiLgn.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 pro fold square render 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The Pixel experience in a foldable package</strong></em></p><p>Although it's about to be supplanted by a newer model, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still an impressive device with two glorious 120Hz OLED displays, a solid Tensor chipset, and outstanding battery life.

This feature is rolling out globally on computers and phones, letting users "describe any story you can imagine" and receive a 10-page storybook in return. Users don't just have to rely on their words with Gemini, as Google states, you can use a variety of external materials to help the AI see what you have in mind.</p><p>For example, Google says users can use their memories as fuel for Gemini. If you've got photos of a recent trip on your device, users can upload them to Gemini to tell it to create a story from that. Similarly, if you've got a little one, you can snap a picture of their drawing, too.</p><p>Google states users can tell Gemini that the photo is of their child's drawing and to create a storybook that "brings his/her drawing to life." If you're interested, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/3727e49b234d">here's an example</a> of one such story created with Gemini.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiYQadKvhGs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Additionally, Google says parents can use Gemini's AI storybook creation to help their child or children understand complex topics or lessons, such as sharing.</p><p>Gemini's storybooks are outfitted with narration capabilities, meaning you'll have an AI voice to read your story aloud. It's perfect for those nights when you're far too tired. Parents can also share their stories or print them out, so your little one can ask you to read them again and again and again.</p><p>Google states this update is rolling out today (Aug 5), and that you can try it out. We've tested this out, and it seems available for the most part. "Storybook" is marked as an experiment right now, so keep that in mind when using it.</p><h2 id="gemini-advances-2">Gemini Advances</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:972px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.35%;"><img id="jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX" name="google-gemini-storybook-ai-creation-ask-example" alt="An example of asking Gemini if it can create a storybook, to which it replies "yes" and asks for the reader's age, the story's plot, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkxE46dT4yPjLn9EDMVNXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="972" height="538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini's most recent (and substantial) update was in mid-July when Google introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-flash-lite-generally-available-fastest-cost-efficient-series-version">2.5 Flash-Lite model</a>. After spending a month in "preview," the 2.5 Flash-Lite model arrived as Google's most cost-efficient version of Gemini. This update mainly focused on developers, as Google announced devs could find $0.10 per 1M token input and $0.40 for output.</p><p>Companies got in on the 2.5 Flash-Lite variant, as well, revealing that it's helped cut down on processing satellite telemetry and more. In short, this updated version of Flash is much lighter, meaning its processing should be speedy for math, coding, science, and such topics. Google states this model strikes a balance between speed and power, though other version of Gemini holds a little more power for more complex topics.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's alleged "sources" state that Google will delay the market availability of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a by roughly two months. That paints an October picture for consumers interested in using those devices.</p><p>The publication adds that Google has reportedly run into "supply chain issues," and nothing more than that was said.</p><p>While the rumor suggests consumers should look toward early October for the previously mentioned devices, that theory seems to regard when your shipment should arrive. It looks like consumers can still pre-order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a after Google's event on August 20. It's just the wait to receive them that's going to be daunting, if this is true.</p><p>It seems as though this "delay" will affect all consumers, and it's not just region locked. Again, we're missing some context here, so we'll have to see what the Made by Google event holds later this month officially. The publication claims the other devices, the main Google Pixel 10 series, are on schedule.</p><h2 id="the-event-s-coming-up-2">The event's coming up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The folks at 9to5 thought back to the Pixel 9 series launch, which saw the base and Pro XL models ship in August, right after the event. However, everything else was scattered throughout September. While shipping delays have happened before, this alleged two-month wait (especially for Google's newest smartwatch) seems extreme.</p><p>The rumor is food for thought right now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-teaser-roasts-apple-for-dragging-its-feet-on-siri">we've got another official Google teaser</a> to get us excited. The company posted a teaser for its Pixel 10 yesterday (Aug 4), which also threw shade at Apple. Google mocked Apple's sluggish progression toward Siri's big AI upgrade, which was previously promised for the iPhone 16. Since that has yet to arrive, Google says "just change your phone," with a not-so-subtle wink toward the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>Also, a recent Pixel Watch 4 rumor claims the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/turns-out-the-pixel-watch-4s-price-tag-isnt-half-bad">might not see a price boost</a>. Consumers might see a $349 and $399 price tag for its 41mm and 45mm sizes, respectively, just like in 2024. A surprising note is that the LTE model could drop by ~$50, which consumers might like.</p><p>Google's upcoming event is slated for August 20, where we will see its Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a, and more revealed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update highlights the company's focus on improving the shareability of what its users create and capture. Nothing starts with an update for "Flip-to-Record," stating users can now save their audio recordings or share them via texts and other platforms.</p><p>After finishing a recording, users can head to the three-dot menu of its overview and tap "Share." A new "Recording" option will be present, and tapping it will display a "Share" and "Save" button.</p><p>Nothing's example shows users should find convenient options, like Google Drive, Android's Quick Share, Discord (a messaging app), and more.</p><p>The second update concerns <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space's</a> "Memories." The post states users can export their captured content as an image, a PDF, or a Markdown file. There is something to note with this: while your captured content enables you to save it with a voice recording, the sharing function will not include that clip. Instead, when sharing a memory with others, Essential Space will create a snapshot of it.</p><p>You'll find the image you took at the top, with Essential Space's title for it and your audio file's transcription.</p><h2 id="nothing-os-2">Nothing OS</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:637px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.19%;"><img id="BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY" name="nothing-essential-space-recording-sharing" alt="Users can now share an audio recording through Nothing OS latest update." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciLgdGenfxe27jjpicMMY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="637" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:568px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.63%;"><img id="Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX" name="nothing-essential-space-memories-sharing" alt="Nothing's newest update lets users share "Memories" as an image, PDF, or a Markdown file." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rbz77E5emahSSUJ8LPrdKX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="568" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While these updates should be automatically downloaded to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, Nothing states you can also manually install it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothing.ntessentialspace&hl=en_GB">via the Play Store</a> when available.</p><p>This is the second update to Essential Space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/nothings-essential-space-just-got-with-google-calendar-sync-and-more">in the past couple of weeks</a>.

The platform is tightening up its defenses against shady group invites, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">sketchy messages</a>, and pyramid schemes disguised as quick cash gigs.</p><p>To tackle these threats, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is experimenting with a feature that alerts you when a stranger drops you into a group. You’ll see key details, like who created the group and how many members are in it, before deciding whether to bail or stick around. Notifications stay muted until you confirm you want to stay.</p><p>For one-on-one chats, WhatsApp is also experimenting with warnings when messaging someone not in your contacts, adding extra context to help you decide if the conversation is legit.</p><h2 id="mass-account-purge-2">Mass account purge</h2><p>The Meta-owned platform says that in the first half of this year alone, WhatsApp booted over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers. Most of these are run by organized crime groups in Southeast Asia, often using forced labor. The cybercriminals are said to be using a mix of crypto bait, get-rich-quick schemes, and fake investment deals, all engineered to look just convincing enough to catch people off guard.</p><p>Scam campaigns now stretch across multiple platforms, sometimes all in one hit. A recent case linked to a scam center in Cambodia started with AI-generated messages created using ChatGPT, lured people into WhatsApp, and then quickly shuffled them off to Telegram and TikTok for bogus “paid” tasks. Victims were eventually asked to deposit money into a crypto wallet.</p><p>This kind of multi-app hopscotch isn’t random. It’s a deliberate strategy to stay under the radar by giving each platform only a tiny glimpse of what’s going on. It’s also one reason Meta, OpenAI, and other tech players are teaming up more often to share intelligence and cut off these scams before they snowball.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdzPRc82wt4p6tyTL22YeE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpXajNqzrCEJmgZK8RDKgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE" name="WhatsApp-scam-tips" alt="WhatsApp tips for fighting off scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xxg5vRChmQz5rRfC6G35iE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>WhatsApp notes that scams usually start with something that seems harmless: a text, a job offer, maybe a DM about a lost package or unpaid bill.</p><p>The platform recommends taking a pause before replying to unfamiliar numbers, questioning any requests that sound urgent, and verifying who’s really on the other end.

Education is super important and one of those things that's worth spending on, but you still want to get the right stuff for the right price. That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Duet 11 Chromebook</a> comes into the picture.</p><p>A lot of primary education institutions provide a Chromebook for students to use throughout the year, but if you're off to college or your kid's school doesn't offer its own Chromebook program, you need to take a look.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d5iqP2qC44iyxdNakiEHpn" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-5.jpg" alt="Side view of Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5iqP2qC44iyxdNakiEHpn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Lenovo Duet 11 isn't the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebook</a> you can buy, but there are a few things that make it a standout for a student.</p><p><strong>The Lenovo Duet 11 is super portable. </strong>As a convertible tablet and laptop, the Lenovo Duet 11 is thin, light, and easy to stuff into a backpack so you can lug it around all day.</p><p><strong>It promises up to 12 hours of battery life</strong> and mostly delivers. The battery on this thing will last all day and well into a night of homework. Recharging it is simple with a good USB charger.</p><p><strong>It runs Chrome OS</strong>. This is a bigger deal than you may think because Chrome OS was designed to run well on even the most modest hardware. It's also a great way to tie into any online Google services and will sync directly with your Google Drive if that's how you want to go.</p><p><strong>It has a surprisingly good display</strong>. The 11-inch 1080p display is bright and easy on the eyes. That's something most cheap Chromebooks can't offer.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The Cons</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vz7A9nWEFHin3RWcDPi8ra" name="microsd-card-01" alt="A microSD card on a fingertip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vz7A9nWEFHin3RWcDPi8ra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Lenovo Duet 11 only has 4GB of memory</strong>. To be fair, that's enough to do anything a Chromebook is capable of doing, but it can struggle when trying to do more than one task at a time. You aren't going to want to have 100 Chrome tabs open on this thing.</p><p><strong>It only has 128GB of storage</strong>. That might be enough for some people, but it won't be enough for others. The thing is, you can never change that number. You get 128GB no matter what.</p><p><strong>It has no SD card slot</strong>. Combined with the limited storage, this means you are going to have to juggle what you store on your Duet 11 Chromebook. No dropping that huge music collection on it.</p><p><strong>It doesn't have the best chip</strong>. The MediaTek Kompanio 838 is enough, but there's little headroom for stuff like playing games at 60 frames without stuttering.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16.jpg" alt="Cloud storage settings on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JByWPaeinqfw3jo8Ar8bjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't buy the Lenovo Duet 11 (2024) for myself because I don't need it.

Together, this new collection is said to bring stunning brilliance to Motorola's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025</a> and its newest open-ear buds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Buds Loop</a>. Starting with the phone, Motorola highlights the Razr 2025's "accented and dazzling" use of Swarovski crystals on its "leather-inspired" finish.</p><p>The back of the Razr 2025 features the majority of the crystals in Motorola's new PANTONE Ice Melt color. The company has provided the device with a quilt-like design, where each indentation sports a shiny crystal. Motorola states there are "35 precisely hand-positioned Swarovski crystals, including a larger one with 26 facets on the hinge."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-Pantone-Ice-Melt-Swarovski-crystals" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in Pantone Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSn2xmmfkbu2akZfEJfcbG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2732" height="1537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The remainder of the foldable looks the same as you'd expect, with its full edge-to-edge cover display and dual camera array.

During that launch, the company already revealed the Buds Loop with a Swarovski crystal-inspired design. The crystals lined its stem, bringing a pop or brilliance to the device when worn, as it catches the light. The main difference is that the Swarovski crystals were only available for the Buds Loop PANTONE French Oak variant.</p><p>Now, launching alongside the Razr 2025 is a PANTONE Ice Melt option for the Buds Loop, as well. This cooler color option should pair well with the Swarovski crystals. Motorola reiterated the Buds Loop's open-ear design, which should help reduce user fatigue when worn for extended periods of time. Additionally, this open-ear design helps to keep users engaged with the world around them, so you're not completely unaware when outside.</p><p>This Swarovski collaboration is reportedly "just the beginning" for the Motorola Collection series. The post states this collection involves limited quantities and more devices "coming soon."</p><p>The collection, which features the Motorola Razr 2025 and Buds Loop in PANTONE Ice Melt with Swarovski crystals, will be available on August 7, starting at $999. Consumers can find the devices in the Brilliant Collection at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola.com. The company adds that its collection will also hit Cricket Wireless on August 15.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The smaller the number, the wider the opening, and the more light your camera can take in.</p><p>Pairing the same sensor with an F/1.4 aperture lets the Galaxy S26 Ultra pull in more light, giving it a boost in low-light shots. It also creates a shallower depth of field, so you’ll get a nice background blur that makes subjects pop.</p><p>In a follow-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1952338888921673912" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the leaker said the updated camera is rumored to take in about 47% more light than the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><h2 id="pro-mode-fans-this-one-s-for-you-2">Pro mode fans, this one’s for you</h2><p>This upgrade might fly under the radar for casual users, but for photographers who rely on Samsung’s manual controls, that wider aperture is a big win, especially when shooting in low light.</p><p>Samsung and Google don’t usually shake up their smartphone camera hardware too often. But this new rumor hints that the next Galaxy Ultra might finally bring a big change to the table.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It already has the manufacturing process in place for such an endeavor, considering that it's been releasing gaming handhelds for just over five years.</p><p>Beyond that, AYANEO also already has an agreement in place with Qualcomm. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a> was the first handheld to make use of the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. And that just so happens to be the same chip AYANEO will be relying on with its upcoming Pocket DS.</p><p>Earlier this year, AYANEO the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-pocket-s2-and-s2-pro-pre-orders-are-now-open-with-shipping-to-begin-soon">Pocket S2 and Pocket S2 Pro</a> were announced in conjunction with Qualcomm's introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</a>.

Currently, that would be the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomms-next-powerful-chip-gets-a-launch-date-in-september">Snapdragon Summit</a> is scheduled to take place on September 23.</p><p>This is where we'll likely learn about Qualcomm's next-gen flagship chip, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>. It would serve as a mighty fine opportunity for AYANEO to get some more publicity and brand recognition before launching a phone. However, I'm on the fence about whether AYANEO will actually be involved in any of the announcements.</p><p>Another potential scenario is that AYANEO could instead lean on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. Doing so would likely mean cheaper processors, which would (hopefully) result in a less-expensive phone.

With this, users can connect to various devices, such as wireless earbuds and headphones, laptops, gaming controllers, and even other phones.</p><p>Bluetooth SIG, the body that regulates and establishes Bluetooth specifications, includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/">security measures and resources</a> in the core specification to ensure that users can establish secure connections. However, the nature of Bluetooth, like many wireless technologies, makes it possible to take advantage of vulnerabilities. Thus, Bluetooth is not foolproof or 100% secure, and can be exploited to take control of your phone.</p><h2 id="don-t-worry-but-be-wary-2">Don't worry, but be wary</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there's little reason to worry, but plenty of reasons to remain cautious. Brian Hussman, an independent security researcher, tells Android Central that Bluetooth exploits are not often taken advantage of, which is good news for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> users.</p><p>"Bluetooth is notoriously insecure, but it's not often exploited," Hussman tells us. "It takes the right knowledge and equipment to pull off something like a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack or to gain control of a device via Bluetooth once you've found out how to exploit the device itself.</p><p>While it still has plenty of room for improvement, Bluetooth has become much safer and reliable in the past few years."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="72fkSZJh2z7HYmD29AMNtX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-05" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with Samsung Health open and a Galaxy Watch 5 on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/72fkSZJh2z7HYmD29AMNtX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Samsung updates the Galaxy S25 on a monthly cadence with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">security patches</a> that address various vulnerabilities, such as those related to Bluetooth.

The FCC has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-protect-yourself-online">list of guidelines</a> on how you can protect yourself when using Bluetooth, including:</p><ul><li>Turning off Bluetooth when it's not in use.</li><li>Unpairing your phone from a rental car's Bluetooth and clearing any data.</li><li>Use Bluetooth in "hidden" mode.</li></ul><p>That last one is pretty easy, as your phone is only "discoverable" when you're present on the Bluetooth menu in your phone's settings. However, you should still be wary of and reject unfamiliar Bluetooth pairing requests.

Google and Samsung each use different strategies to separate their flagship models. Google has the base model, Pro, and Pro XL, whereas Samsung uses a base model, Plus, and Ultra (plus the Edge, if you count it). This creates an interesting situation where the base Samsung Galaxy S25 will be competing with both the upcoming Pixel 10 <em>and</em> Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>Ahead of Google's official unveiling of the Pixel 10 Pro in August, let's take a look at how this unreleased smartphone might compare to the current Galaxy S25. They're rumored to be more similar than you may think, each offering triple-camera systems on the back and smaller flagship-caliber displays. If you're in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great compact flagship</a>, you might be choosing between these two phones later this summer.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">officially announced the Pixel 10 launch event</a>, and the Made by Google 2025 showcase is set for Aug. 20. We expect to see the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>, including the Pixel 10 Pro, debut at this event alongside new Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds models. Currently, the Pixel 10 Pro is expected to keep its $999 starting price point, but it's possible that it will change ahead of its launch.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro is rumored to start with 128GB of base storage for another year,  with higher-priced upgrades available to 256GB, 512GB, and possibly 1TB configurations. It's reported that the phone will be available in four colorways: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade. For those keeping track at home, that's black, white, bluish-gray, and green in normal colors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> in January, and it has been available for purchase since February. The base model starts with 128GB of storage but is more accessible at a cheaper $799 retail price. Months after its official launch, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">frequently available much cheaper than that</a>.

Google Pixel phones have been on the bulky side of the market comparatively, and in a way, the brand is likely sticking to that identity too with the Pixel 10 Pro. The phone is rumored to get thicker and heavier, but it's also rumored to add features like magnetic Qi2 charging, a larger battery capacity, and faster charging across the board.</p><p>Those who enjoy small phones will find comfort in the Galaxy S25's tiny feel. It's expected to be smaller than the Pixel 10 Pro by every measure, and by a wide margin. The device measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and weighs 162 grams, which is seriously light. By comparison, the Google Pixel 10 Pro is said to measure 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm and weigh 207 grams, according to current rumors.</p><p>You get a lot in exchange for the bulkier feel. With that being said, the Pixel 10 Pro might feel gargantuan for some, and it'll only get worse when you start adding cases and screen protectors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XKdWmdmtNbQRWjCzVrU98" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-19" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XKdWmdmtNbQRWjCzVrU98.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A small part of the reason the Galaxy S25 is more compact than the rumored Pixel 10 Pro is due to its smaller display. The phone has a 6.2-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display panel, which can support 120Hz variable refresh rates. It's covered by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the entire phone has an IP68 rating against dust and water. It's a gorgeous panel, but it is slightly smaller than the 6.3-inch screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and soon the Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro will at the very least match the Pixel 9 Pro's display specifications, so we're likely looking at a 6.3-inch Actua OLED panel with roughly a 1280 x 2856 resolution. We may also get 120Hz variable refresh rate support and a 3,000-nit brightness level. Like the Galaxy S25, the Pixel 10 Pro should be secured with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 certification.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is reportedly planning a few key hardware upgrades for the Pixel 10 Pro.

This year, the Tensor G5 is said to be manufactured by TSMC for the first time, which has people excited. It's possible the Tensor G5 will be more performant than any other Google chip thanks to TSMC's 3nm process node. It could mean the Pixel 10 Pro will finally be able to hang with Qualcomm-powered handsets in raw performance.</p><p>While Google is still trying to catch up to Qualcomm-powered phones, the Samsung Galaxy S25 <em>is</em> a Qualcomm-powered phone. The Galaxy S25 uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is a breakthrough SoC that may be the best in the world. The Pixel 10 Pro is expected to match the Galaxy S25's 12GB of memory, but it probably won't beat the Snapdragon 8 Elite and performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15) </p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,870mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm; 207g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, Jade</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Google may be prepping to beat Samsung in one key area: Qi2 support.

Samsung hasn't updated its camera loadout in years. By comparison, even the smaller "Pro" Pixel usually features top-notch camera hardware. We're expecting at least a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP telephoto lens, and a 48MP ultrawide.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro's telephoto camera should support 5x optical zoom, which will beat out the Galaxy S25's 3x optical zoom support. With a 42MP front-facing camera, the Pixel 10 Pro is rumored to have the edge for selfies, too. It'll likely beat the 12MP selfie cam on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is equipped with a 50MP main camera, a 12MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide sensor. The hardware is dated, and there's a big dropoff from the primary shooter to the secondary lenses.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-which-flagship-will-be-best-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Which flagship will be best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="QmDNZoT6AXXi6Moge8G7cb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmDNZoT6AXXi6Moge8G7cb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Depending on your needs and price point, there will likely be plenty of reasons to choose either the Google Pixel 10 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S25. The Pixel 10 Pro will probably have a superior camera system, and it'll also bring a larger screen and battery, according to rumors. There's also talk of a more powerful Tensor G5 chip and support for QI2 with inbuilt magnets, which are nice perks.</p><p>However, the Pixel 10 Pro is expected to retail for at least $1,000, and that's $200 more than the Galaxy S25 costs at full price. With ongoing discounts, you can regularly find the Galaxy S25 even more affordable than that, sweetening the deal. The Google Pixel 10 Pro might be better than the Galaxy S25, but will it be a few hundred dollars better?</p><p>Maybe not, especially considering the Galaxy S25 has plenty of perks of its own. It includes a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and a thin-and-light chassis. All told, current rumors point to the Pixel 10 Pro facing stiff competition from the Galaxy S25 when the new Google phone launches.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1d5b101c-12ce-414a-becc-0b8fec20cf85">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A worthy challenger</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro won't be thinner or lighter than the Galaxy S25, but it may harness a more robust feature set.

Trifold phones have my attention! I question the durability, though. Foldables in general had a rough start and I like to keep a phone for a full two years. I'm wondering how having more glass and a second hinge is going to affect the longevity of the device.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></em></p><p>Hi Rick. You also mentioned that English wasn't your first language and apologized for any errors, so I have to tell you that your English is better than mine!</p><p>In regard to your question, it's very important. It's also something that most people aren't thinking about and probably won't until enough people get a tri-fold device to show off pictures of broken ones on social media. That makes it doubly important to me. We saw the same scenario when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-you-should-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung debuted the Z Fold</a>, and displays started separating and cracking.</p><p>Your reasoning is very sound. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">mechanical problems with foldables</a> stem from using super-thin glass and a hinge. A tri-fold will have one more of both. When you make glass that thin, any imperfection will (not might, but will) cause a crack. In turn, that crack will grow until it reaches the edge of the glass itself and can go no further.</p><p>When the display layer is embedded into the glass sandwich, you have more than just a crack in the glass to contend with. Any ding or even a fingernail gouge could make the screen unusable.</p><p>To combat this, phone makers keep working on how the glass, the display component, and very tough and flexible polymers can be layered to toughen things up. A phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is much better than the original Z Fold, and even better than last year's Fold 6 when it comes to the display materials.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything centers on the hinge, though. It's not the flashy showcase part of a foldable phone, but it should be because it's the most important. The hinge only needs to do one thing: open or close. But it has to do it perfectly, or it can add to the issues with using thin glass.</p><p>The hinge needs to prevent the glass from twisting while it's being bent. It also needs to be rigid enough to keep the glass firmly in place while open or closed. That's not easy to do, but phones with hinges are a lot better now than they used to be.</p><p>I have a feeling that the tech has progressed far enough that tri-folding phones won't be any more problematic than "regular" foldables. That means it should stand up to normal use, but it also means there are two points of failure. We will see more issues because of that extra moving part.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-rear-panels" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept from behind, showing off its three panels and triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't buy a tri-folding phone until version two comes out at the earliest.

Google is now using that gap to its advantage, spotlighting the delay in its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> teaser.</p><p>Google’s latest Pixel 10 teaser on YouTube opens with a moody silhouette of the Pixel 10 Pro before finally pulling back the curtain on the full look.</p><p>The ad itself is pretty minimal, skipping over specs and new features to get straight to the point. Set to the instrumental of a classic Dr. Dre song, the video directly targets Apple Intelligence, calling out the year-long delay of a feature that was promised as "coming soon."</p><p>Google is clearly eyeing iPhone users with this one, telling them to “Get outside your comfort phone.” Then the voice-over goes in: "If you buy a new phone because of a feature that's coming soon, but it's been a full year, you could change your definition of 'soon' or you could just change your phone."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR_6Z1IDD8s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="apple-s-coming-soon-timeline-gets-called-out-2">Apple’s “coming soon” timeline gets called out</h2><p>The line clearly calls out Apple’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">long-delayed AI Siri upgrade</a>. The company promised a game-changing AI Siri with the iPhone 16, but more than a year later, the key features are still missing in action.</p><p>After an official delay, Apple is now quietly aiming for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/apple-targets-spring-2026-for-release-of-delayed-siri-ai-upgrade" target="_blank">spring 2026 launch</a>, though that’s just the internal timeline.</p><p>The ad closes with a full reveal of the Pixel 10 and a locked-in launch date: August 20, 2025. Ending a dig at Apple’s delays with an exact release day is Google's classic way of throwing the former's fuzzy AI timeline into sharper relief.</p><p>What really grabs attention is the Pixel 10 Pro in a new Moonstone finish, a metallic blue that’s clearly set to be the star of the lineup. It’s likely to be the crowd favorite, though matte black fans still have their classic fallback.</p><p>The teaser may be subtle, but the Pixel 10's design is no secret at this point. Even before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Google's official preview</a>, leaks had already spilled the beans.

But as an audio nerd, I’m looking forward to hearing what the company has in store for the next pair of Google Pixel Buds.</p><p>Google teased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Aug. 20 keynote</a> by saying we’ll get the latest on “Pixel phones, watches, <strong>buds</strong>, and more.” While the Pixel Buds Pro 2 probably aren’t due for a refresh yet, the four-year-old Pixel Buds A-series could use an update. They still retail for $100 before any discounts, and lack necessities like active noise-canceling (ANC) by 2025 standards.</p><p>The rumor mill provides some insight as to what Google may be planning for Pixel Buds at its upcoming event, but there are still a ton of unknowns — like the earbuds’ potential specs and price point. Ahead of an expected announcement, I switched back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> to find out which features I’d love for the rumored Pixel Buds 2a to make more affordable. Considering how good the market for midrange earbuds currently is, Google has a lot of work to do.</p><h2 id="what-the-rumors-and-leaks-are-saying-about-the-google-pixel-buds-2a-2">What the rumors and leaks are saying about the Google Pixel Buds 2a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6" name="Pixel-Buds-2a" alt="Pixel Buds 2a -Iris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An alleged leaked render of the Google Pixel Buds 2a.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we haven’t heard anything about the Google Pixel Buds 2a hardware, a recent leak from Android Headlines claims to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/new-leak-shows-off-rumored-pixel-buds-2a-weeks-ahead-of-launch">reveal official renders for the budget earbuds</a>. Like the current Pixel Buds A-series, the Pixel Buds 2a render goes all-in on color, with bright colorways that match across the inside of the charging case and buds.</p><p>This is one way the Pixel Buds 2a can separate itself from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, as the premium earbuds only have the outside of the buds colored in — the inside portion of the buds and the case interior are both black regardless of what color you choose. For better or worse, it matches industry trends of offering more fun and exciting color options on cheaper products.</p><p>The alleged render shows the Pixel Buds 2a in what is believed to be the Iris colorway, and other rumors predict that there will also be Strawberry, Fog Light, and Hazel options.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W66k9V7YduaGRKXazVjjfH" name="google-pixel-buds-a-series-review-26.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds A-Series in-hand with lid open outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W66k9V7YduaGRKXazVjjfH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The original Google Pixel Buds A-series (2021) with the case open.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Buds 2a render appears to show Google sticking to its classic Pixel Buds design language. That includes earbuds without a stem and a pebble-shaped charging case that opens vertically from the top. This isn’t a bad thing, because Google has a good thing going with Pixel Buds design. It’s unique and matches the rest of the Google Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>There could be one hint in the leaked render that gives us an idea of what features the Google Pixel Buds 2a might offer. The earbuds themselves have some kind of vent or mesh grill that isn’t present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">original Pixel Buds A-series</a>. It doesn’t look identical to the openings we see on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which are used for ANC, but they are definitely similar. If this render is accurate, the Pixel Buds 2a might offer ANC and transparency mode for the first time.</p><h2 id="what-i-want-the-pixel-buds-2a-to-borrow-from-the-pixel-buds-pro-2-2">What I want the Pixel Buds 2a to borrow from the Pixel Buds Pro 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aWkHqyKNWznWRvZaEdZYpG" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-5" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aWkHqyKNWznWRvZaEdZYpG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The number one thing the Google Pixel Buds 2a need to borrow from the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is support for active noise-canceling. When the Pixel Buds A-series came out, you could get away with not offering ANC at the $100 price point. Fast-forward to 2025, and the situation is completely different. Even cheap earbuds have support for ANC of some kind. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> have pretty great ANC despite costing only $130.</p><p>If Google is trying to hit the $100 price point with the Pixel Buds 2a, it still needs to include ANC and transparency mode functionality. The quality doesn’t have to be identical to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 — the company can cut the custom Tensor A1 chip used for audio and ANC processing or offer fewer microphones to keep the earbuds affordable. However, ANC <em>does </em>need to be there in some way, shape, or form, and based on the leaked Pixel Buds 2a render, Google knows that too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-8" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway beside their charging case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google should also improve the on-earbud controls for the Pixel Buds 2a. While I’m not usually a fan of capacitive buttons and gesture-based controls, they’re excellent on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. Every tap, swipe, and hold gesture is registered by my Pixel Buds Pro 2, and I don’t have to push super hard on the earbuds to activate them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pixel Buds A-series only offer half of the experience. You get playback control on the Pixel Buds A-series, but not swipe gestures for volume control. It’s annoying to have to reach for your phone or use a voice assistant to raise or lower the volume, and Google needs to address this on the Pixel Buds 2a.</p><p>That’s especially true if the Pixel Buds 2a are indeed getting support for ANC modes. The inclusion of ANC would add another set of tap and press controls to the Pixel Buds 2a, and the more on-earbud controls there are, the more reliable and useful they need to be.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway next to the Pixel Buds companion app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Buds A-series case doesn’t have wireless charging support, while the Pixel Buds Pro 2 case does. It’s easy to throw the Pixel Buds Pro 2 on a charging pad to top up the case’s battery daily, or use a Pixel phone to reverse wireless charge the earbuds in a pinch. As a general rule, I’m totally fine with brands cutting wireless charging support from budget and midrange earbuds — I’d rather them focus on keeping the cost down and putting more emphasis on sound quality and ANC.</p><p>In terms of battery life, the Pixel Buds A-series are solid, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are outstanding. With the former, you’ll get five hours of listening time on a single charge. The more premium Pixel Buds Pro 2 give you up to 12 hours of playback with ANC off, and up to 48 hours including the charging case. Google doesn’t have to bring the Pixel Buds 2a all the way up to the Pixel Buds Pro 2’s level, but it does need to increase battery life to account for ANC usage, if it’s added.</p><h2 id="upgrades-could-come-at-a-cost-2">Upgrades could come at a cost</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JFv4Ly66qMm5zFb8kooMWE" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-7" alt="A single Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbud in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFv4Ly66qMm5zFb8kooMWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google doesn’t have a long list of things to add to the Pixel Buds 2a.

Frankly, there just aren't very many 16-inch Chromebooks out there, with that being a space largely dominated by various Acer Chromebook options.</p><p>That said, the big screen isn't the <em>only</em> reason why this should be on your list, as it packs plenty of power with the i3-1315U chip. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is pretty much what you'd expect from a budget Chromebook Plus model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vrocDf3kGSxoj5u2eyHmrR" name="Acer-Chromebook-Plus-516-hero-render" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus 516 promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vrocDf3kGSxoj5u2eyHmrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1700" height="956" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the Chromebook Plus 516 has another benefit when compared to even the 516 GE, and that's battery life. Despite its massive size, the battery is rated to last for more than 12 hours on a single charge. Even some of the more portable or premium Chromebooks can't match up to that.</p><p>And if you needed any more reasons to sway you, there's one more, and that's Google AI. When purchasing a new Chromebook Plus model (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-chromebook-plus-516-laptop-with-google-ai-16-wuxga-display-intel-i3-1315u-8gb-lpddr5-128gb-ufs-wi-fi-6e-steel-gray/6618158.p?skuId=6618158">CB Plus 516</a>), you'll have access to Google AI Pro for 12 months.</p><p>This includes being able to access Gemini from practically anywhere, along with 2TB of cloud storage, and NotebookLM already installed and pinned to the shelf out of the box. All of that, comes for free, saving you another $240, which is just madness.</p><h2 id="back-to-school-2025-quick-links-2">Back to school 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

That's where it gets tricky — each major Android manufacturer has its own set of unique AI features.

The "best of both worlds" situation is why I love using AI on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, but Motorola is dangerously close to beating Galaxy AI at its own game.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> uses a mix of AI models and services, includes Motorola-exclusive features, and relies on custom hardware buttons to make accessing it all easier. On paper, that's all the makings of a standout mobile AI suite. In reality, the execution is somewhat questionable. That being said, if you're looking for a sleeper contender that can win the mobile AI race with the right moves, it's Motorola.</p><h2 id="motorola-doesn-t-have-a-horse-in-the-ai-race-and-that-s-a-good-thing-2">Motorola doesn't have a horse in the AI race — and that's a good thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G93igybGZ4Qzd96YFLxeZk" name="Moto-AI-5" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G93igybGZ4Qzd96YFLxeZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to mobile AI, the most important thing is giving users choice — how much AI they want to use, which models and services they prefer, and whether compute is handled on or off device. For some Android brands, that philosophy might conflict with their broader AI strategy. It's unlikely that Google is going to integrate third-party AI models natively in Pixel phones, as that would hurt the company's efforts with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-deep-think-is-finally-heading-to-google-ai-ultra-users">DeepMind</a>, Gemini, and Google AI.</p><p>Motorola isn't trying to compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or ChatGPT, and that gives it an advantage. Moto AI can use whatever AI model or service is best at handling a given task without needing to worry about exclusivity.</p><p>Motorola currently uses Google, Microsoft, Meta, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">Perplexity</a> natively as part of Moto AI. I don't know of any other Android brand that uses a greater variety of AI models and services to power its mobile AI suite than Motorola.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="boYuKiaMasDYH9Y5q3yLEm" name="Moto-AI-2" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/boYuKiaMasDYH9Y5q3yLEm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With this kind of utility, the user always wins. Moto AI picks the best model or agent for the job.</p><p>Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a> lineup was the first to integrate Perplexity in a phone, and it powers a Next Move feature that intelligently surfaces the AI features you'll need most in a given situation. Meta's Llama models are used to power Catch Me Up, the notification-summarization feature. And, you can "Ask Copilot" when using Moto AI to tap into Microsoft and OpenAI smarts.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, Moto AI's backbone is built on Google AI. You also get all the Google features that are available cross-platform on Android, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini with live video and screen sharing support</a>.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-s-feature-set-is-rock-solid-2">Moto AI's feature set is rock solid</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pi3BbcAzBFBdN8MNMzZAwj" name="Moto-AI-4" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pi3BbcAzBFBdN8MNMzZAwj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola also seems to be picking the right AI features to develop, because many of them are actually useful. Pay Attention is an audio-recording feature that can transcribe and summarize meetings, conversations, and more on your smartphone.</p><p>I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-wore-an-ai-voice-recorder-on-my-wrist-for-a-week-heres-how-it-went">tested an expensive dedicated AI recorder</a>, so there's clearly demand for this kind of tool. Eventually, I came to the realization that it could've just been an app. With Moto AI, it effectively is one, and it can help you pay more attention in meetings or calls.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YsMWjzGfD8cAbtMuZGwNQj" name="Moto-AI-1" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YsMWjzGfD8cAbtMuZGwNQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember This is another handy note-taking tool. Instead of audio recordings, it's intended to help you capture photos or screenshots and write text-based notes on the fly. You can snap a picture of a piece of paper you don't want to lose with a written note to help you remember what it is. I wish you didn't have to ask Moto AI's universal search for help recalling saved memories, but the concept is still helpful.</p><p>Finally, generative AI-based photo editing is a bit controversial, but it is solid with Moto AI. Magic Canvas will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">create AI-generated images from scratch</a>, and Group Shot is Motorola's version of Best Take — it captures multiple photos to ensure that everyone in the photo has their eyes open in the resulting image.</p><p>The Moto AI suite is thorough but not overwhelming, partially because features like Next Move help show only the tools you'll need in a given situation.</p><h2 id="moto-ai-only-needs-a-few-tweaks-to-be-a-game-changer-2">Moto AI only needs a few tweaks to be a game-changer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, Moto AI is a bit rough around the edges. The inclusion of the AI Key on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> was an excellent move, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-2025-ai-key-stylish-design-launch">it's already available on other Motorola phones</a>. Hardware buttons are an important part of mobile AI, because having the power button responsible for too many actions is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>The problem is, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">the AI Key in its current state is too limited</a> to be all that useful. Moto AI doesn't start listening when you trigger the AI Key — you need to also tap the mic button on the screen, which kind of defeats the point. You also can't remap it to Gemini or specific features aside from Remember This and Pay Attention. It'd be nice if it worked more like triggering a classic assistant, where Moto AI would start listening immediately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HfCBMWbuzxdsTZiTdxUFk" name="Moto-AI-6" alt="Moto AI features on the Motorola Razr 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HfCBMWbuzxdsTZiTdxUFk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI Key is a microcosm for the Moto AI suite as a whole. With a few small changes, the AI Key could be incredibly useful and a differentiator for Motorola phones.</p><p>The same is true for Moto AI at large. If Motorola made it as easy to recall Remember This memories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">as Nothing's Essential Space</a>, I'd love it. If Motorola borrowed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's toggle for only running AI features on-device</a>, it would address the needs of privacy-conscious users.</p><p>My wishlist of things I'd like to see Motorola improve is quite small when you think about it. The company could tweak all of these aspects of Moto AI in a software update. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/android-15-is-widely-rolling-out-for-motorola-razr-plus-2024-owners-in-the-us">Moto AI only exited the beta testing stage</a> relatively recently, I'm optimistic Motorola is heading in the right direction.

That could make the phone free, PLUS you'll still get the $150 gift card. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip7-256gb-unlocked-jet-black/6635720.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="413908cd-55e7-4d6c-ab40-a0c9af110776" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $150 gift with carrier activation at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99, plus free $150 gift with carrier activation at Best Buy">View Deal</a></p></div><p>We called it the "best clamshell foldable you can buy in North America" in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 review</a>, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. Straight out of the box, the flip phone stuns with two AMOLED 120Hz displays, an unbelievably thin form factor with IP48 durability, and a virtually-invisible folding crease. It honestly feels like a slimmer Motorola Razr Ultra, and while that phone boasts a bit more power than its Samsung counterpart, the cheaper Z Flip 7 easily holds its own when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">directly compare the two</a>. </p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also features seven years of OS upgrades, a powerful Exynos 2500 chipset, and all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/5-best-ai-features-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy AI software features</a>. One bummer is that the phone&apos;s camera tech hasn&apos;t been upgraded since last year, and the slim design means that the Z Flip 7&apos;s battery life is serviceable, but not amazing. </p><p>Needless to say, if you&apos;ve been waiting for a good time to buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 unlocked, these free gift card deals might be your best chance. Once these offers expire, however, you&apos;re probably better off waiting for the fall sales to arrive. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The original pair, revealed in 2023, granted its buds with a 60mAh battery each, and popped a 479mAh battery in its charging case. Should these listings prove true, consumers might see quite an extension in battery life overall.</p><p>Rumors about Samsung's second-generation Buds FE have snuck up on us; however, they've begun to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/alleged-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pro-like-mirror-render-leaked">allege an upgraded experience</a>. In mid-July, reports supposedly revealed the Galaxy Buds 3 FE design via a render. If true, the buds could look quite similar to Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with a black silicone tip and the "Blade Design."</p><p>It's also unclear if the Buds 3 FE will support Samsung's "Blade Lights." The base Galaxy Buds 3 do not support this, so there might be a chance that the FE variant skips this, too.</p><p>Other details are still in the dark, but there's a chance we're only a month away from a reveal.

It seems we're looking at a September launch, though nothing's set in stone just yet. Pricing is also a wonder for this year's Buds FE. We only have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">the original</a> to look back on from 2023, which debuted at $99.</p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This new NFC outlet, which would be "at the top of the device," would join the Galaxy series' pre-existing sensor near its cameras. It seems, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">yet again</a>, Samsung is looking at Apple for ways it can improve its user experience.</p><p>The publication cites a Samsung "official" who claims that while Apple "holds many" patents related to this NFC sensor upgrade, it's taken the company time to "technically circumvent them" for the upcoming Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>However, this is all in the name of convenience as Samsung reportedly seeks to upgrade the experiences users have with Samsung Wallet. It seems the OEM is listening to user feedback and grievances, such as failed NFC payments due to its sensor placement. What's more, it seems Samsung is interested in reducing "awkward hand movements" in order to get the NFC sensor to play nice with a retailer's scanner, per the publication.</p><p>There still seems to be some hesitancy around whether or not Samsung will debut this new NFC sensor on the Galaxy S26. We're only in August, so there's plenty of time for this to happen—or not.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-s26-trail-thus-far-2">The Galaxy S26 trail thus far</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ft67MBAmJGQn9RPKAJwj7k" name="lock-screen-variations-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Lock Screen Variations button on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ft67MBAmJGQn9RPKAJwj7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of late, there have been some rumored upgrades for the base Galaxy S26, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">which concern its cameras</a>. Some allege that its entire array won't see an upgrade, except for its telephoto lens, which could jump from 10MP to 12MP. The lens is speculated to retain its 3x zoom capabilities, but the alleged 12MP upgrade could help users capture even better shots. We also have a more recent rumor from the end of July that claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">thinner with speedy charging</a>.</p><p>The Ultra model could feel lighter in consumer hands next year, while shaving off roughly 1mm, moving under the 7mm mark. For charging, tipsters purport the top-tier device could finally shed its 45W charging for 60W, though there are varying reports about this, so take it with a grain of salt.</p><p>Samsung's also recently updated its in-store shopping experience with its Wallet app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-now-lets-you-split-in-store-payments-into-installments">rolling out installment plans</a> for users.
