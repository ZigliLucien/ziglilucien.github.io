<p>The latest phone from OnePlus has impressive specs, including its charging speed. Just like the global variant of the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the OnePlus 13 has a charging speed of 100W but only with the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a> from OnePlus. Much like Samsung, Google, and Apple, OnePlus uses its own charging spec called SuperVOOC charging. Thanks to this, you can charge your OnePlus 13 from zero to 100 percent in only 36 minutes. Additionally, OnePlus says that with a 1% charge, you can enjoy 13 hours of standby time or 56 minutes of runtime for text chats.</p><p>The latest OnePlus 13 also supports wireless charging and can deliver 50W wireless charging, but there is a catch. As is the case with the phone&apos;s 100W wired charging, you need to use OnePlus&apos; own wireless charger to get that speed wirelessly. It also has 5W reverse wired charging that allows you to charge other devices, such as your smartwatch or another phone, via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>.</p><p>The 100W charging speed is an improvement over the previous model, but also not an improvement at the same time. It is unclear whether North American variants of the device will get the same spec. Since the region&apos;s OnePlus 12 models came with 80W charging as opposed to the global variant&apos;s 100W charging speed, it is very likely that the same might happen again with the OnePlus 13. This is mainly because of the electrical system in the region.</p><p>Even though fast charging can be a huge help when you need to charge your phone as fast as possible, it can also generate heat. Heat only damages your phone&apos;s battery, reducing battery performance, life span, and capacity. Even though the latest smartphones are made to manage heat better, it&apos;s best to avoid overheating by not using your phone for things such as gaming or other heavy-duty activities while it&apos;s charging. If you want to get more out of the charge, it&apos;s best to go with wired charging since it&apos;s more efficient than wireless.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung has begun rolling out the November security patch for its flagship series in the U.S.</li><li>The carrier-locked Galaxy S24 and S23 Plus models in the U.S. have started receiving the firmware this week.</li><li>The update comprises 38 vulnerability fixes in the Android operating system and 13 bug fixes in the One UI OS.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung began rolling out the monthly security updates to its flagship Galaxy S24 series and its predecessor models this week. The updates include the latest security patch and some bug fixes.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-november-2024-security-update-usa-locked/">SamMobile</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> models in the U.S. seem to be the first set of phones to get the November security patch, including the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. All these models from the country are carrier-locked versions, and the firmware includes the <strong>S92xUSQS4AXJA</strong> version.</p>
<p>It further comprises multiple vulnerabilities found in the previous software version. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-november-2024-security-patch-detailed/">publication notes</a> that the security patch has 38 vulnerability fixes for the Android 14 OS the devices ship with and another 13 in Samsung’s One UI. The former is believed to have high-risk vulnerabilities, and it is encouraging to see the company tackle them with a prompt rollout of the latest security update.</p><p>However, the rollout is not limited to the Galaxy S24 series but also to the previous iterations—the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s23-november-2024-security-update-usa/">update bears</a> the <strong>S911xSQS5CXI8</strong> firmware version, which is also rolling to the carrier-unlocked versions of these models in the U.S.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Galaxy device owners in the U.S. can navigate to their device’s <strong>Settings > Software update ></strong> and hit <strong>Download and Install</strong>. The rollout of the latest firmware for carrier-locked versions is likely gradual, and handset owners across regions might receive it in the coming weeks.</p><p>The latest security patch comes amidst the anticipated One UI 7 beta rollout, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">tipped</a> to bring a major revamp for the Galaxy devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-android-15-beta-impending-arrival">Recent leaks</a> have indicated that the beta for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based update will likely debut soon, likely in the coming weeks. Samsung has already indicated that the stable One UI 7 update will commence next year, likely with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>Aside from the revamp, One UI 7 ought to bring numerous new features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">smoother animations</a> across the interface. Smarter notifications are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">also tipped</a> to be coming with the latest operating system, which should likely work similarly to Apple’s notification summary that ventured recently with the iOS 18 update to iPhones.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Honor clearly knows what it&apos;s doing when it comes to foldables; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-vs-review">Magic Vs</a> was a great showcase for what the brand can achieve, but it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> that gave the Chinese manufacturer a distinct advantage.</p><p>By delivering the thinnest and lightest foldable, Honor managed to easily carve out a niche in this segment. That said, availability issues of the global model hindered the brand&apos;s progress to an extent, and that&apos;s something Honor is looking to change with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>.</p><p>The Magic V3 uses the same design foundation as its predecessor, but it is even thinner and lighter, and honestly, it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re using a bulky foldable. It is just 5g heavier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and while it is 0.7mm thicker when folded, that isn&apos;t evident when using the device.</p><p>The thin-and-light design makes the Magic V3 stand out considerably, and it just feels better to hold and use than other foldables — it makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> look archaic. I used the Magic V3 for just over a month, and here&apos;s why I think this is the best foldable you can buy today.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="twyTs5HAKxddoTDn5ojg6H" name="honor-magic-v3-review-13.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view with Honor logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twyTs5HAKxddoTDn5ojg6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor unveiled the Magic V3 in China on July 12, and the foldable went on sale in the country later in the month. The brand launched the foldable in global markets at IFA 2024, and the Magic V3 is now on sale in the U.K. and other global markets.</p><p>Honor is bringing a single 16GB/512GB variant of the device outside China, and it costs £1,699 ($2,209) in the U.K. At the moment, you can get a £300 ($390) discount on the device when buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/phones/honor-magic-v3/buy/">from Honor&apos;s website</a>, and that brings it down to £1,399 ($1,819) — £200 less than the equivalent model of the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>You also get a decent number of freebies with the foldable; Honor bundles the Band 9, a 100W charger, the X6 earbuds, and an additional six-month screen protection covering both panels.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-design"><span>Honor Magic V3: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE" name="honor-magic-v3-review-16.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded against a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor&apos;s foldable differentiation revolves around lightweight designs, and the Magic V3 is the thinnest foldable you can buy today. The device is just 4.4mm unfolded, and that&apos;s unbelievably thin; if anything, it feels like the brand could have made the device thinner if not for the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="psdMN6AjRSCF9fPwHtVofC" name="honor-magic-v3-review-1.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psdMN6AjRSCF9fPwHtVofC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultra-thin profile makes using the V3 an absolute joy; the inner screen in particular is outstanding. What&apos;s just as noteworthy is that the Magic V3 is 9.2mm thick when folded, and this more than anything else makes the foldable stand out — you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re using a foldable at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nB4YVXpPrZbjzAw4padScF" name="honor-magic-v3-review-10.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nB4YVXpPrZbjzAw4padScF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor is the weight. At 226g, the Magic V3 isn&apos;t just lighter than other foldables — it beats conventional phones in this regard. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is 2g <em>heavier</em> than the Magic V3, and that conveys the scale of what Honor managed to achieve with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rC6ygy4BKyBLaDPMJYu36G" name="honor-magic-v3-review-21.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 cover panel with icons showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rC6ygy4BKyBLaDPMJYu36G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design means the Magic V3 is just as comfortable to hold and use as a regular phone. The cover screen is sufficiently wide that it isn&apos;t a problem at all — unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — and there are subtle curves around the sides and rounded edges that make a difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EMaVVxnSAX3cXRS6hjFCxC" name="honor-magic-v3-review-5.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EMaVVxnSAX3cXRS6hjFCxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with a matte texture at the back that feels great, and the green model of the Magic V3 looks understated. If you need a bold color option, the Reddish Brown variant is the one to get. The back is dominated by the camera island, which is similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The island uses an octagonal design, and the three camera modules are ensconced within.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P6j6GGXbskreSUhQiDnLgD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-12.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view with cameras highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6j6GGXbskreSUhQiDnLgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The steel of the camera island contrasts well with the back, and the phone doesn&apos;t wobble when using it on a flat surface. This isn&apos;t the case when the device is unfolded; as the camera island sits to the side in that mode, you get a noticeable wobble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6R8JmSxPWGBafwDKXQVo6D" name="honor-magic-v3-review-6.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 side view with hinge highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6R8JmSxPWGBafwDKXQVo6D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with a stainless steel hinge that&apos;s the thinnest in the industry, and it is durable, with the brand touting a million unfolds. Like last year, the hinge can stay open at any angle between 45 to 140 degrees, and that unlocks the ability for unique use cases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH" name="honor-magic-v3-review-31.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hinge itself has a smooth articulation and doesn&apos;t need much force to open, and while you get a visible crease, it is not as noticeable as other foldables I tested this year — the crease on the Z Fold 6 is much more prominent.</p>
<p>The aluminum frame adds rigidity to the device, and there&apos;s IPX8 water resistance, giving the Magic V3 the ability to withstand the elements. On the whole, the design is easily one of the best around, and the thin profile and lightweight chassis makes the Magic V3 a fantastic choice if you&apos;re ready to make the switch to a foldable.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-displays"><span>Honor Magic V3: Displays</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MDCvJ8vPBMLSVQfpLN2myD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-32.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MDCvJ8vPBMLSVQfpLN2myD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor didn&apos;t change the sizing of the panels with the Magic V3, and the device gets the same 6.43-inch cover panel and 7.92-inch inner screen as its predecessor. Both panels go up to 120Hz and come with LTPO tech to dynamically adjust screen refresh, and the inner screen gets an AMOLED panel while an OLED display is used outside.</p><p>There&apos;s plenty of cool tech on hand this time around, and Honor continues to lead the way when it comes to making devices with eye comfort in mind. Both panels have high PWM dimming — the inner screen goes up to 3,840Hz and the cover panel hits 4,320Hz — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">AI-assisted Defocus Eyecare feature</a> is legitimately useful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ELPVSQJhihdLhzjKgCGBqD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-22.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded against colorful background with crease visible" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELPVSQJhihdLhzjKgCGBqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both panels have good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get decent customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance to your preferences. A nifty utility that I made good use of is the ebook mode; most manufacturers offered something similar in the past, but you don&apos;t get the feature in as many devices these days, so I&apos;m glad that Honor retained it.</p><p>In ebook mode, the screen effectively turns monochrome, making the Magic V3 a great choice for reading books — particularly on the inner screen. On the other side of the equation, the phone has Dolby Vision integration, and HDR content is a delight to stream — it makes a noticeable difference within Netflix and YouTube.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M566MTmQb2DA5hKoo5WS7J" name="honor-magic-v3-review-37.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 YouTube video in minimized mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M566MTmQb2DA5hKoo5WS7J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the inner screen gets noticeably brighter than the Magic V2, it isn&apos;t quite as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a>, which gets almost as bright as regular phones. That said, there are no issues with brightness levels on the cover screen, and it is among the brightest in this category.</p><p>Gaming is also enjoyable on the device, and the built-in sound is loud enough that you don&apos;t need to use earbuds for casual gaming sessions. While the Magic V3 has a crease — like every other foldable — it isn&apos;t as visible, and it wasn&apos;t a limitation in my usage of the device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-performance"><span>Honor Magic V3: Performance</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2vVuqk4LjsMpesrEvrbHTJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-34.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 device statistics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vVuqk4LjsMpesrEvrbHTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Magic V3 has one of the best hardware packages in this segment, and there really isn&apos;t anything missing. The device features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see any slowdowns in day-to-day use, and the Magic V3 did a great job handling demanding games. Given the limited thermal management, the foldable got considerably hotter than bar-style phones, and it throttled sooner than usual. That said, I got consistent framerates in most titles, and outside the excessive heat, there were no issues.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 managed a stability score of 71.6% in 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, which is decent enough. However, it went up to 46 degrees Celsius in that time, and that&apos;s six degrees hotter than most 2024 foldables. The device had slightly lower scores in Geekbench 6.0 than other 8 Gen 3-powered phones I tested recently, but it wasn&apos;t an issue in daily use.</p><p>Like most other foldables, Honor uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that&apos;s baked into the power button, and while it doesn&apos;t have any problems, I would have liked to see an in-screen option.</p><p>Coming to connectivity, the device has Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, dual-band GPS, USB-C with DisplayPort 1.2, and the entire suite of AptX codecs. I didn&apos;t notice any problems when making calls or using cellular data, and I got a reliable Bluetooth connection when pairing accessories.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 has a 5150mAh battery, and just like the Magic V6 Pro, Honor uses silicon-carbon tech to deliver better density. Other brands are starting to use a similar system in their own devices, and the battery is a smidgen bigger than what we got the V2 last year.</p><p>I got a day&apos;s worth of use out of the Magic V3 between charges, but even with heavy use involving the inner panel, the foldable needed to be plugged in before the night. There aren&apos;t tangible gains in this area over the V2, and other foldables I used this year delivered better battery life.</p><p>The Magic V3 charges at 66W, and Honor bundles the requisite charger in the box. It takes just under 50 minutes to fully charge the battery, with an 80% charge attained in 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHLYVAimKmbC7LQHXnCFMD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-11.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view with hexagonal camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHLYVAimKmbC7LQHXnCFMD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor has sizeable upgrades on the camera front, with the Magic V3 featuring a trio of new sensors, including a 50MP f/1.6 main camera with OIS, 50MP telephoto with OIS that goes up to 3.5x zoom, and a new 40MP wide-angle lens with autofocus. You get a 20MP front camera housed inside each panel.</p><p>Honor&apos;s collaboration with Harcourt is intact, and you get three distinct styles that you can use when taking portrait shots. The camera interface itself is identical to last year, and you get the usual set of shooting modes, including the ability to take photos of fast-moving objects.</p><p>The Magic V3 takes 4K60 video at all focal lengths, and there&apos;s a dedicated video-focused night mode similar to what you get with Night Sight Video on Pixels. The Movie mode has greater control over videos, and you get a Pro mode with still images that lets you tweak individual settings.</p>

<p>While it&apos;s not on par with the Magic 6 Pro or Vivo X100 Ultra, the Magic V3 does a great job in daylight situations, with good details and accurate color rendition. The resultant photos aren&apos;t oversaturated, but they still look great.</p><p>There are three color modes available — Natural, Vibrant, and Authentic — and the latter adds a vignette to the shots. I went with the Vibrant mode as it delivered better vibrancy to the images. The new zoom lens delivers detailed photos at up to 3.5x, and it does a good job with portraits as well.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right, and while it doesn&apos;t quite measure up in challenging low-light scenarios, it is better than what you get on most other foldables. The lens doubles as a macro shooter as it has autofocus, and it takes detailed photos from just 4cm away.</p><p>Overall, the Magic V3 does an admirable job in this regard. The X Fold3 Pro still has an edge when it comes to foldables, but the Magic V3 isn&apos;t that far behind, and that&apos;s a big deal in and of itself.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-software"><span>Honor Magic V3: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WLiZZZWTxGBhpXwq2GFXEG" name="honor-magic-v3-review-35.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded with Android 14 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLiZZZWTxGBhpXwq2GFXEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Magic V3 runs MagicOS 8.0.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and the interface is nearly identical to previous years. Honor&apos;s UI is in need of a facelift, and while there is plenty to like, the interface still has vestiges of legacy EMUI, and that needs to change.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kuUEhGvRebZitTo46HZfSF" name="honor-magic-v3-review-23.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded with notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuUEhGvRebZitTo46HZfSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the interface itself is smooth, and the software is optimized to take advantage of the powerful hardware, so you won&apos;t see any lag or jitter in daily use. There is a noticeable uptick in fluidity, and Honor addressed long-standing issues, like the ability to not view app info while long pressing an app icon in the drawer. Honor&apos;s take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>&apos;s Dynamic Island is useful, and I found myself using the feature quite a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJMDMfEU6QUH3rf6FzWkZG" name="honor-magic-v3-review-24.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded with taskbar showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJMDMfEU6QUH3rf6FzWkZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the suggestions bar located at the top of the app drawer still doesn&apos;t deliver useful apps, and you get the same list of utilities all the time. Memory management continues to be aggressive, and there were issues with push notifications at times. Outside of those bugbears, I didn&apos;t see any problems with the Magic V3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8KkM2LQkzFPtuyJRddiAmH" name="honor-magic-v3-review-36.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 Dynamic Island clone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8KkM2LQkzFPtuyJRddiAmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s plenty of AI-based utilities as well, and Magic Portal is useful if you want to collate information or look up a photo online. Honor teamed up with Google to enable face-to-face translation, and the feature does a great job. You also get Circle to Search, and a host of other Google utilities.</p><p>Coming to foldable use, there&apos;s plenty to like on the Magic V3. There&apos;s a split notification shade, a taskbar that&apos;s easily accessible, and intuitive multi-window modes. The basics are covered here, and you get a good amount of customization as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to software updates, the Magic V3 will get the same four years of Android OS updates alongside five years of security patches. While that&apos;s not as many as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6, it is in line with what other Chinese manufacturers deliver, but I&apos;d like to see Honor do better in this regard. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-the-competition"><span>Honor Magic V3: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5D7YBWjoXaazCywUDBPUuE" name="honor-magic-v3-review-38.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Magic V2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5D7YBWjoXaazCywUDBPUuE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldables are no longer a niche, and there are plenty of great choices in this category. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the obvious starting point for a lot of users, but I wouldn&apos;t even pit the foldable in the same league as the Magic V3 — it feels a few generations behind in terms of the hardware.</p><p>Vivo&apos;s X Fold3 Pro is the closest rival to the Magic V3, with the device offering a svelte design, terrific hardware, great battery life, and outstanding cameras. It has the best battery life of any foldable I used this year, and the best overall cameras. The only limiting factor is that it is sold in just a few countries globally, and if anything, that works out to Honor&apos;s advantage.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is a good foldable as well, and it has the best software and AI-based features in this category. The design is much better than its predecessor, and while it isn&apos;t powerful by any measure, it doesn&apos;t have issues in daily use. But the biggest issue with the 9 Pro Fold is that the cameras just aren&apos;t good enough, and if that&apos;s a consideration, you should just get the Magic V3.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Magic V3: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH" name="honor-magic-v3-review-31.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the thinnest foldable available today</li><li>You need bright OLED panels that are easy on the eyes</li><li>You want powerful hardware and great cameras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best battery life</li><li>You need in-screen sensors</li></ul>
<p>The Magic V3 has its drawbacks; the X Fold3 Pro has better battery life, and I like the fact that Vivo somehow managed to slot in two in-screen sensors, instead of the side-mounted fingerprint reader that&apos;s standard on every other device in this segment.</p><p>Vivo also has an edge when it comes to the cameras, with the auxiliary lenses in particular delivering fabulous shots. That said, the Magic V3 does a great job in its own right, and it has one of the best camera packages in this category — it outshines the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold by a considerable margin.</p><p>The Magic V3 also has the brightest OLED panel of any foldable, and Honor leads the pack when it comes to eye-friendly tech. The hardware is among the best in this class, and while it isn&apos;t a huge upgrade over the Magic V2, there are enough small tweaks to give the V3 an edge.</p><p>Ultimately, I prefer the Magic V3 because of the design, and I like the direction Honor is taking with the software. MagicOS needs a visual overhaul, but the upcoming MagicOS 9.0 build looks interesting to say the least, and the brand has a ton of custom features and is leaning heavily on AI utilities you&apos;ll actually end up using.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how many times a week I get asked, "What phone should I buy, Namerah?". What most people fail to ask, however, is what steps you need to take <em>after</em> you've bought your phone. Since nobody asked, I'm going to tell you anyway.</p><p>Once you've spent your very hard-earned money on something, you obviously want it to last. Phones are investments, people; they require some good TLC. If you intend to hold on to your device for at least two to three years, you can't use it as is out of the box. Preserving its condition is important, especially when you intend to trade it in a few years down the line. The better the condition, the higher the trade-in value.</p><p>If you're rocking a ball-busting flagship, the last thing you'd want is a scratch or crack. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> cost over a thousand dollars these days. Who wouldn't want to keep that valuable of a possession in good shape?</p><p>So, here are the first five things that you need to buy right after purchasing your brand-new phone. Some of these add-ons protect your phone, while others provide essential services.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the trend with modern smartphones is to eliminate useful things and then call it a feature. Just like headphone jacks and microSD card slots, USB-C chargers are no longer available with newer Android and iOS phones. You do get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> in the box, but not the adapter to plug into, so it needs to be bought separately.</p><p>While you probably have a charging brick lying around at home, the wattage and ports need to be correct so you can get your phone's maximum charging speed. Another factor to worry about is whether your phone has a specific fast charging standard that needs to be met, like Programmable Power Supply (PPS) or Power Deliver (PD).</p><p>I won't get into the specifics, but be sure to read the fine print and match your phone's fast charging standard with the charger that you're buying. If you're feeling lost, we do have a handy guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers for Android and iOS</a> to help you understand and make an informed decision.</p>
<h2 id="2-a-screen-protector-2">2. A screen protector</h2>

<p>I know some people like to risk it all and use their phones in the nude. I think those people are stupid. Even a cheap $5 plastic screen protector or the free factory-installed film on your phone is better than using your phone without any protection.</p><p>Accidents happen; we are all human. The problem is not every phone company is going to replace your expensive 120Hz AMOLED screen for free. What's worse is that some brands don't even offer screen replacement at all, even if you have the money to pay for it. Why risk that?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">Screen protectors</a> are of mainly two types. You've got your sturdy tempered glass protectors with 9H hardness. These are great for shatter-proofing but not always case-friendly. They also don't play nice with curved displays.</p><p>The other sort is a plastic film, which is generally made of PET or TPU. If you're buying the fancy sort, it might even be a hybrid "glass-tic" mix like the kind offered by ZAGG. TPU and hybrid films are generally more durable. Films are thinner than glass, so you get a much better touch response. They can also self-heal small abrasions. However, you do not get hardy shatter-proofing or as robust drop protection for your phone's screen, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">choose wisely</a>.</p>

<p>If you're planning on trading in your phone, it's a very smart idea to purchase a phone case to keep its body in mint condition. Another reason is to add friction. A lot of sleek and sexy-looking smartphones as very slippery. You can fix this problem and prevent accidental drops with the help a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases">decent case</a>, especially one that has scored or textured sides for added grip.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Phone cases</a> and covers are a dime a dozen. You can find all manner of phone cases, from thin, lightweight ones to thick, heavy-duty ones. Price isn't an issue for most devices unless you're looking to buy a case for a foldable phone.</p><p>Apart from the price, focus on the impact protection offered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-2024-cases">phone case</a> you're eyeing. Many case makers specify how many feet of drop protection their cases add, and some even go the extra mile by adding an antimicrobial layer that kills germs.</p>

<p>You might be scoffing at this one, but let me tell you why you're wrong. Flagship and mid-range phones no longer have headphone jacks. So, what will you do when you want to listen to music privately or watch something in a public space? I'll tell you what you won't do: blast your tunes or play your video on your phone's speaker as people eye you on the subway or the local coffee shop.</p><p>Of course, you need a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">decent wireless earbuds</a> to go with your audio port-less phone. How else would you get audio playback delivered directly to your ears? The good news is that you don't need to shell out hundreds of dollars to get a good pair of earbuds. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-amazing-budget">CMF by Nothing Buds cost only $39</a>!</p>
<h2 id="5-a-magsafe-adapter-ring-2">5. A MagSafe adapter ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WQxR9ykTZms2cR89RnXrod" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-spigen-magsafe-adapter.jpg" alt="Using the Spigen MagSafe ring on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQxR9ykTZms2cR89RnXrod.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am a firm believer that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">MagSafe adapter is the one ring to rule them all</a>. Forget smart rings, you can get this sticky magnetic adapter for any phone with the spare change in your pocket. But why is it an essential purchase? Let me explain.</p><p>Once you have all the basics like a screen protector and a phone case, you'll want more accessories a phone grip or a stand. A MagSafe adapter enables you to magnetically attach any accessory and detach it at will, whenever, wherever. It's a high level of convenience that cannot be attained otherwise.</p><p>Think about it. You don't need to fiddle with stupid arms on a car charger or stand anymore. Phone grips won't have to be adhesively attached to your phone case forever. And you can use wireless chargers without fear of the coils becoming misaligned. Getting a MagSafe adapter ring opens up a world of opportunities for your Android or older iOS device. You can use all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a> with it, whether they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> wireless car chargers, MagSafe phone grips, or magnetic wallet attachments.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the end of the line when it comes to accessorizing and customizing your phone. You can get smartwatches, smart rings, power banks, and all sorts of extras to go with your phone. Some folks like buying kickstands and selfie-sticks. Others like Bluetooth accessories like speakers.</p><p>You can get as many additional gadgets and accessories as you want to go with your phone. However, anything else you get would be non-essential, at least in my books.</p>

By undercutting the bigger names with solid quality, it's been able to stand out in a crowded field without breaking the bank.</p><p>The Soundcore Space One Pro stretch that proposition to a point where affordability is more relative. In other words, you have to pay more for these headphones under the impression that you're getting awesome performance for less than the best pairs generally sell for. Do they deliver? Let's find out.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-anker-soundcore-space-one-pro-price-and-availability"><span>Anker Soundcore Space One Pro: Price and availability</span></h3>
<p>Anker released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch"><u></u></a>the Soundcore Space One Pro headphones in September 2024, and they are pretty easy to find, mostly online over brick-and-mortar stores. These are something of a first for the company, so it's hard to tell when it might launch a newer version. Chances are, they will be available for quite a while. They start out at $200, though discounts could always happen down the road.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-anker-soundcore-space-one-pro-what-s-good"><span>Anker Soundcore Space One Pro: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="26VndF4Dnzt3aP2fnhsRFX" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-wearing-angle" alt="Man wearing Anker Soundcore Space One Pro headphones with ear cup and cushion in view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/26VndF4Dnzt3aP2fnhsRFX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Space One Pro headphones are supposed to be a more refined and advanced version of the $100 Space One. They share similarities in design but diverge in a couple of ways. One is the ear cups swivel 180 degrees, and the other is there are hinges that let them fold in, making this one of the easiest pairs to contort for storage or travel. The downside is you only get a cloth bag instead of a hardened case to keep them in.</p><p>The ear cushions are nice and plush, settling in nicely once you put the headphones on. They're also large enough to create a tighter seal around your ears. Not to mention how soft the headband is. Considering the lightweight body, these should feel comfortable right after putting them on.</p><p>Just don't expect them to look svelte on your head. The ear cups are a bit thick, and while there are color options to choose from, the overall aesthetic here leans more towards function than fashion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Hc2BoBPiPwPM28pN9TzSm" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-cushions" alt="Anker Soundcore Space One Pro ear cups with exposed cushions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Hc2BoBPiPwPM28pN9TzSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's just as well since Anker loads up the Space One Pro with a number of features. For starters, the Soundcore app presents an array of custom options and settings you can use to your advantage. That includes an EQ to tune the audio, adaptive active noise cancelation (ANC), and a series of specific settings that apply to connectivity and phone calls.</p><p>This isn't unusual for Soundcore headphones. Anker has long packed its app with supporting features to make them more adaptable. In this case, it also tries to expand the audio menu by including support for the LDAC hi-res Bluetooth codec on top of the standard SBC and AAC. You have to turn that setting on in the app, and when you do, it forces a restart, so it's something you commit to each time you use it.</p><p>Mind you, it's only worth using if you're listening to tunes from sources that can give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a>, like Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, or Qobuz.. Either way, Anker didn't tune the Space One Pro to necessarily sound like balanced cans anyway. They are decidedly bass-friendly with the "Soundcore Signature" EQ preset signifying what the sonic focus is here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="RzT5NCrjsnY8fLasb9sxC4" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots from Soundcore app showing main screen, ANC, and sound effects settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RzT5NCrjsnY8fLasb9sxC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't say that to knock these headphones, just to measure expectations going in. If you like some bass but really want to pull out detail in the mids, you're better off tweaking the EQ and creating a custom preset for yourself. There are over 20 to choose from off the bat but I'm not convinced most will hit the spot for a lot of listeners.</p><p>You could also give HearID Sound a try, a quick sound test (in quiet settings) that lets you choose from a series of two different audio tuning options while listening to them. It takes the data and formulates a custom EQ setting based on the results. I actually had better luck with the EQ, personally.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These do sound like $200 headphones — even more so when you tinker and find the sounds that appeal most to you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What you can expect is some solid clarity and vibrant highs to go with the thicker sound. These do sound like $200 headphones — primarily when you tinker and find the sounds that appeal most to you. LDAC support is great, and really does add something different when the source material is good. I recommend playing around with the EQ because it also pays dividends for content like podcasts and audiobooks where too much bass isn't necessary.</p><p>The Space One Pro support Dolby Audio but not Atmos. Nor is there any true spatial audio here. Not a big loss if you're not into that sort of thing, but something to point out since some competitors offer that in the same price range.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hkmqP6n3zq6LvXLZxnDaZB" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-profile" alt="Side profile view of Soundcore Space Pro One headphones on man's head." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hkmqP6n3zq6LvXLZxnDaZB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ANC gives you five levels of potency as a convenient way to keep it going without needing its full effect. Regardless of which number you choose between one and five, noise-cancelation is more effective with low-frequency sounds. That tracks with Anker's performance in this area, as I've noticed similar results with its other headphones and earbuds as well.</p><p>It makes the Space One Pro perfectly fine on a commute where you want to drown out the hum of a plane or train, but they won't be as effective with high-frequency sounds, which you'll notice walking past a construction site, among other situations. For a bigger boost, turn on Wind Reduction to drown out more.</p><p>The passive isolation from the ear cushions plays a big role. You can tell by simply talking while wearing them with no audio. The muffled sound is indicative of a tighter seal helping ANC do its thing more effectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="xgAgF7H8yMtWovwSWpPWJU" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-screenshots-2" alt="Anker Soundcore Space One Pro screenshots showing various control options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xgAgF7H8yMtWovwSWpPWJU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of voice, Anker wisely addresses communication and phone calls with neat features. Easy Chat is one of my favorites because it lowers the music volume once I start talking, making it possible to hear someone say something brief in response without touching the controls. By default, the audio returns to its previous volume after five seconds but you can also choose 10- or 15-second delays.</p><p>Another is Side Tone, which helps you hear your own voice during a call so you're not speaking louder than normal. You'll find that under More Settings.</p><p>These features grow in importance since call quality is quite good under varying circumstances. Quiet rooms are no problem, while busier environments don't get in the way of both sides hearing each other. It's always a plus when you can wear over-ear headphones while walking outside and still have a chat despite the street noise. Transparency mode is great for when you want to listen to something while knowing your surroundings as well.</p><p>Multipoint support ensures you can stay connected to your phone and another device at the same time. It's a common feature for headphones at this price but Anker has long offered it in budget pairs, too.</p>

I like the tactile feel of physical buttons because they're generally more reliable for certain controls, like volume or skipping tracks.</p><p>The NC button on the left cup cycles through ANC and Transparency, or it can answer/reject an incoming call. Press it twice and you can toggle BassUp as a boost. The play/pause button on the right plays/pauses with a single press, while holding it for two seconds wakes your voice assistant. The volume buttons also let you skip a track or go back one when you long press them.</p><p>As for battery life, Anker claims 40 hours with ANC on and 60 hours with it off. These numbers hold but only if you don't raise the volume too much and use the LDAC codec sparingly.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="efnyzVT9FrefmT8r8hvufN" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-upright" alt="Anker Soundcore Space One Pro headphones on table leaning against post." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efnyzVT9FrefmT8r8hvufN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a shame Anker didn't consider including a hard case to go with these headphones. It sends a strange signal to consumers when you launch something more expensive than your brand is known for, yet cheapen out on the very thing that serves to protect it. Clearly, it's a cost-cutting move but it sends a weird message when less expensive Soundcore headphones come with hard cases.</p><p>The Space One Pro also have no IP rating, so I would caution against using these at the gym for sweaty workouts. It's just hard to tell whether they can sustain that kind of exposure over time.</p><p>It's great that you get wired playback here, including a 3.5mm cable. Not to mention that ANC works while using it too. The downside is Anker doesn't replicate the experience with the USB-C port, so if you want to use it to listen through your phone or tablet to reduce latency, you'll have to use an adapter instead.</p>

<p>You have a lot to consider when you're ready to plunk down $200 for a pair of over-ear headphones. This is a competitive price range, and while the Space One Pro won't necessarily unseat the big boys among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, the previous Space One make the cut as an excellent budget choice for $100 less. Even within Anker's own lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-space-q45-review">Soundcore Space Q45</a> are still viable if your needs aren't too specific.</p><p>Since bass is a standout here, you can also look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/skullcandy-crusher-anc-2-review">Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2</a> as a pair in the same pricing ballpark. They have ridiculous levels of bass and deep app support rivaling what Anker delivers. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-accentum-plus-review">Sennheiser Accentum Plus</a> aren't far off in price but veer far more toward balanced sound, if you want a pair less predisposed to rumbling bass out of the box.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-anker-soundcore-space-one-pro-should-you-buy-them"><span>Anker Soundcore Space One Pro: Should you buy them?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f9kr5tkhvK6efKbfeghKEf" name="Anker-Soundcore-Space-One-Pro-angle" alt="Anker Soundcore Space One Pro headphones leaning upward on a table and wall." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9kr5tkhvK6efKbfeghKEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want plenty of bass.</li><li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li><li>You like hi-res audio support.</li><li>You want excellent app support.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a hard case to carry them.</li><li>You want something more rugged for workouts.</li><li>You want wired USB-C playback.</li></ul>
<p>It's hard for me to settle on a score for the Soundcore Space One Pro because they offer plenty, but also don't bring much that feels new or intriguing to one's ears. That's also because Anker has built a solid foundation in undercutting the competition with real bang for the buck. In this case, the company is asking for more money up front without setting a new tone in more competitive terms.</p><p>These headphones have plenty of custom features and perform well enough to warrant their cost — but only if you're looking for headphones that give you the bass you might be looking for.</p>

Especially when you start watching or listening to something on your phone, but want to switch it over to a smart speaker or even the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>When attached to the Charging Speaker Dock, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> is essentially transformed into a supercharged Nest Hub Max. This includes things such as being able to add it to the Google Home app, while also unlocking the ability to cast music and videos to it.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-cast-music-and-videos-to-the-pixel-tablet"><span>How to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet</span></h3>
<p>Before you can cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet, there are a couple of requirements that first need to be met. These are no different than if you were trying to cast to something like the Nest Hub or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, so these shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>
<ul><li>Your Pixel Tablet must be connected to the Charging Speaker Dock.</li><li>Your phone and tablet must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</li></ul>
<p>1. Open the app that you're using to watch or listen to media on your phone.</p><p>2. Pick something to watch or listen to.</p><p>3. Locate and tap the <strong>Cast</strong> button within the app.</p><p>4. Select your <strong>Pixel Tablet</strong> from the list of options.</p><p>5. After a few moments, the content will begin playing on your Pixel Tablet.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-hold-close-to-cast"><span>How to use 'Hold close to cast'</span></h3>
<p>It's been almost two years, but Google is finally rolling out its "Hold close to cast" feature. This first debuted at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-media-across-devices">CES 2023</a>, however, it wasn't available until Google Play Services was updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-hold-close-to-cast-rollout-spotted">version 24.42.32</a> in October 2024.</p><p>However, it doesn't seem that this feature works for every phone out there, as it relies on Ultra Wideband. Currently, it supports Google's Pro lineup of phones, starting with the Pixel 6 Pro and including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Provided that your phone is updated with the latest version of Play Services, you'll need to first enable this feature.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Google</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>All services</strong> tab.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.56%;"><img id="nxAgkTaExLG9KkNwau5kRc" name="How to enable 'Hold Close to cast'" alt="Steps to enable 'Hold Close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nxAgkTaExLG9KkNwau5kRc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Under <strong>Connected devices & sharing</strong>, tap <strong>Cast options</strong>.</p><p>5. Enable <strong>Hold phone close to cast</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="gV6MScrjbUXRx9q5oqfeRc" name="How to enable 'Hold Close to cast'" alt="Steps to enable 'Hold Close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gV6MScrjbUXRx9q5oqfeRc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you enable this option, being able to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet is pretty darn easy. All you need to do is open your media player of choice and pick something to watch or listen to.</p><p>Then, bring your phone close to the tablet until you feel your phone vibrate. A notification will appear at the top, letting you know that the media playback is being transferred to the Pixel Tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="T6EHFivqoqCdUER2HyXLic" name="How to use 'Hold close to cast' on Pixel phone" alt="How to use 'Hold close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T6EHFivqoqCdUER2HyXLic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once that's done, whatever media was playing on your phone, will now be playing on your Pixel Tablet!</p>
<h2 id="casting-made-easy-2">Casting made easy</h2>
<p>Curiously enough, while we are able to use this on the Pixel 9 Pro, it doesn't seem to be available on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones </a>just yet. The 'Hold close to cast' setting doesn't appear on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, nor is it available on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold running the latest Android 15 beta.</p><p>It's also worth pointing out that while this feature works with Spotify and YouTube, Google notes that "not all media apps work." So your mileage may vary depending on what app you're using to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest beta version (2.24.23.11) of WhatsApp on Android includes a shortcut in the chat bar that opens your gallery instantly, speeding up the media sharing process.</li><li>The new gallery shortcut simplifies sharing, and users can still record quick video messages by pressing and holding the button.</li><li>This feature is still in testing and is available to a limited number of WhatsApp Android beta users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is reportedly testing out a new feature to make sharing photos and videos a breeze by letting you jump straight into your gallery app.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>&apos;s newest beta (version 2.24.23.11) includes evidence of a new feature designed to make sharing media even easier. Now, there’s a shortcut right in the chat bar that opens your gallery instantly, making the whole process faster and smoother, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-23-11-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>.</p><p>At the moment, if you want to share something from your gallery on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, you&apos;ve got to go through either the camera icon or the attachment button, which pulls up a whole menu of options. The attachment option gives you a full menu with Gallery, Camera, Location, Contact, Document, Audio, Poll, and even the new AI-powered Imagine feature.</p><p>On the other hand, this dedicated gallery shortcut definitely makes sharing a bit easier. Plus, users can still send quick video messages by pressing and holding the button, so those who love recording on the fly won’t miss out on this key feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.08%;"><img id="CRhLDKuMYPVASveKZHdJef" name="Whatsapp-media-gallery-app.jpg" alt="WhatsApp media shortcut button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRhLDKuMYPVASveKZHdJef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="379" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Swapping the camera shortcut for the gallery icon might stir up some mixed feelings. It’s a nice perk for those who don’t often use their camera, but the catch is that you can’t just pop open the camera anymore. You’ll need to click the paperclip icon and pick the Camera option from there. So, if you&apos;re used to quickly grabbing and sending photos or videos, this change might not be your favorite.</p><p>At present, this feature is just in the testing phase, and only a handful of WhatsApp Android beta users can try it out. Based on how the feedback goes, the Meta-owned platform might decide to add the gallery shortcut to the chat bar for everyone—or keep it as is.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Since the early days of VR, we've heard the promise that it could challenge traditional sports-watching. Why watch the Warriors game on your flatscreen TV when you could (virtually) sit courtside and see your sports heroes up close as if you'd paid thousands to hang out with the celebs and venture capitalists?</p><p>On Saturday, I strapped on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, opened the Xtadium app, and transported myself to the Toyota Center in Houston for the Warriors-Rockets game, one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nba.com/news/2024-25-nba-vr-schedule">52 basketball games streamed in VR</a> for free for the 2025 season.</p><p>I had a blast...but I also didn't make it a full half. And not because the Warriors almost blew a 30-point lead!</p><p>Your typical TV broadcast uses an eagle-eyed view above the court, interspersed with close-ups of yelling coaches and slo-mo replays. But in VR, it's all about you "being there," so they place 360-degree cameras at center court and above each basketball hoop so you can look wherever you want, immersed in the action with the play-by-play commentary mixed with the actual sounds of the court.</p>

<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gu0svxhZe5c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>At its best, NBA on Quest really does feel immersive. From the backboard cameras, you get close-up views of the players' faces and how they dance in patterns across the court to shake off pursuit, far better than you can from the usual top-down view. I wish Curry hadn't been injured for the game, but seeing my other faves splashing down 3s and bullying the Rockets on defense was fantastic.</p><p>But there's a reason why broadcasts default to a top-down view in arena sports: you need a wide, tall vantage to see the full flow of a game for fast breaks and long passes. And the default side-view camera for Xtadium broadcasts is weirdly low to the ground — probably to avoid blocking people behind it. You feel like a child staring up at giants from the floor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2208px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F3BN2h3fNi3ePsauoveUh4" name="xtadium-warriors-vr-broadcast" alt="A screenshot of the pregame events of a Warriors-Rockets game in the Xtadium app in VR, with the guardian lines visible" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3BN2h3fNi3ePsauoveUh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2208" height="1242" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Xtadium app didn't save most of my screenshots, but I got this one during the pregame; the guardian boundary lines weren't there during the stream. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NBA / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a bigger problem: If you're close up on the action on one side and then there's a fast break, it's completely disorienting to suddenly jump to a courtside angle, then to the other hoop. There's no warning, so you jerk your neck left or right trying to re-find the dribbling player.</p><p>I missed a few highlights because of the hectic camera-warping, and I found myself watching the floating TV screen above the arena at times because it was easier to follow. That obviously defeats the whole purpose of basketball in VR!</p><p>Lastly, you have to accept that you're <em>not</em> at the arena; you're wearing a 1.1-pound headset for 2.5 hours, your eyes straining unless you add prescription lens inserts, and you're sitting alone. The Xtadium app lets you see your mixed-reality surroundings beside and behind you, but if you're sitting on a couch or in bed, all you're really seeing is that arena. When you're on the commercial break sitting and watching giveaways, cheerleaders, and other fan distractions without being able to talk to anyone, it's a bit lonely!</p><p>For all those reasons, I took the headset off before the half and switched to my local broadcast to give my tired eyes and twisting neck a break.</p>

<p>I know this goes against the usual broadcast strategy of curating what people see, but there's one obvious solution to make VR sporting events less hectic and more immersive: Give us camera control.</p><p>Let us point a controller or use hand tracking to select a back-court or side-court view at any time so we can decide which "seat" we're in at any given moment! That way, we can decide to stay in one spot (as if we really were at the game) or jump angles when <em>we're</em> ready for it, not when the broadcast team <em>thinks</em> we are.</p><p>I also think it should be easier to swap from the immersive courtside view to your mixed-reality living room at any moment, especially during commercial breaks! If you're at home watching the game, you'll want to check in on family, pets, or your phone without taking the headset fully off.</p><p>If Xtadium makes watching VR broadcasts less "traditional" and more interactive, then it would truly feel next-gen! As it is, I'll tune in again for the next Warriors game in VR — December 8 against the Timberwolves — to see Steph's antics up close, but I still don't think I'll last the whole game.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s One UI 7 might introduce an AI-driven notification summary feature, similar to Apple’s, starting with Korean language support.</li><li>Notification summaries could be limited to Samsung’s flagship models, possibly excluding Galaxy A series devices.</li><li>One UI 7’s beta release is expected by mid-November, with a new XJW build suggesting a major overhaul compared to earlier versions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor has it that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 7 update could introduce a fresh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> feature that takes a page from Apple’s Intelligence suite.</p><p>Tipster chunvn8888 recently revealed on X that Samsung’s One UI 7 beta (specifically the &apos;XJW&apos; build) is testing an AI-driven notification summary feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-ai-feature-apple-intelligence-3495674/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). At launch, though, it’s only available in Korean, as per the leaker.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy AI now has notification summary feature, it's called AI notification.<a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1852574436446306690">November 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Should Samsung move forward with this feature, we can probably expect more language options down the line. The leaker also hinted that notification summaries might stay exclusive to flagship devices, possibly leaving out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A series</a>.</p><p>Details on how this feature stacks up against Apple’s Intelligence summaries are still pretty sparse. But if it’s anything like Apple’s approach, it could help cut down notification overload by giving you quick, easy-to-read summaries of key information.</p><p>Apple’s AI tech does a great job of bundling tons of notifications into short, easy-to-skim summaries. This way, users can quickly catch the important points without getting bogged down by every single alert.</p><p>There are other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">major One UI 7 updates</a> coming down the line. Rumor has it that Samsung’s next software upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">will bring in some iOS-inspired design elements</a>, like a dynamic island-style lock screen, a revamped Control Center, and smoother, iPhone-like animations. These big design updates could seriously upgrade the One UI 7 experience.</p><p>There’s no official word yet, but with One UI 7 already in testing, it’s clear Samsung is hard at work on this update. A beta release for Samsung users is expected to roll out before the end of the month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It will take another half month before Beta starts<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1852158438484382194">November 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>According to well-known leaker Ice Universe, the One UI 7 beta is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-android-15-beta-impending-arrival">expected to arrive by mid-November</a>. The leaker also mentioned that the new XJW build makes past leaks outdated, hinting at a major overhaul with more flexibility than previous versions.</p>
