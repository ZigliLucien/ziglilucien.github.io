                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is beginning to offer one-time payment options for Preferred Care plans.</li><li>These plans were previously only available for Fitbit products, but can now be purchased for new orders of Pixel phones, tablets, and watches.</li><li>The one-time fee nets buyers Preferred Care coverage for two years at a discount compared to the subscription cost.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google">Google</a> is changing its insurance partner for Preferred Care plans as of today, Feb. 24, and is adding a new payment option as part of the move. The company updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518" target="_blank">official support page</a> with the new insurance provider, as well as the one-time payment option that covers a Pixel phone, tablet, or watch for two years (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-two-year-warranty-3529155/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Previously, all Pixel devices had to be protected with Preferred Care via a subscription.</p><p>Google's Preferred Care plans are a means of insuring a Pixel or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit device</a>, just like AppleCare Plus or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsung-care">Samsung Care</a>. Starting today, there are two different ways of purchasing a Preferred Care plan. You can either insure the device for two years with a one-time payment, or choose a monthly subscription for up to 60 months of total coverage.  In the event your screen is cracked, you'll pay $29 for a repair or up to $129 for a replacement.</p><p>The new offering coincides with a notice that Google changed its insurance provider for Preferred Care: "If your device is shipped on or after February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Asurion Warranty Protection Services, LLC, or one of its affiliates," the company explains in the support document. "If your device is shipped prior to February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Assurant."</p><p>The only apparent consumer-facing change as part of the switch is the addition of the one-time payment option. Like the monthly plan, you can either add a plan during checkout at the Google Store or within 30 days of your purchase.</p><p>The prices for the two-year Preferred Care plans are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 9: $159</li><li>Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL: $249</li><li>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: $279</li><li>Google Pixel Fold: $279</li><li>Google Pixel 8 Pro: $249</li><li>Google Pixel 8: $159</li><li>Google Pixel 8a: $109</li><li>Google Pixel 7a: $99</li><li>Google Pixel 7 Pro: $199</li><li>Google Pixel 7: $149</li><li>Google Pixel Tablet: $99</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 3: $89</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 2: $89</li></ul>
<p>The above prices offer buyers a slight discount on Preferred Care compared to the cost of subscribing monthly for two years. Of course, the downside is that you can't insure your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Pixel device </a>with Preferred Care beyond 24 months if you use the upfront option.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing released a YouTube video explaining the design process for the Phone 3a series, including the big camera bump.</li><li>The move comes just after key official videos of the Phone 3a series were leaked — some of the same shots from the leak are in this 10-minute video.</li><li>Nothing also shared a teaser on X showcasing the smartphones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing's official reveal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-renders-leak">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> is nearing, with a date set for March 4. However, the design of the two midrange smartphones leaked in its entirety over the weekend, leaving little to the imagination. The company followed that up with multiple teasers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1894007732044259657" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1ieD5Vwj8A">YouTube</a> today, Feb. 24, that provide further insight into the design of these phones.</p><p>The full-length video posted to Nothing's YouTube channel lasts more than 10 minutes and shows off the design of the Nothing Phone 3a series. While not specified, the device discussed and showcased appears to be the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, based on recent rumors and leaks. It has a large, circular, and centered camera bump with three rear camera sensors and a flash.</p><p>In an earlier teaser, Nothing revealed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">two of those three rear camera sensors use 50MP lenses</a>. There's a 50MP main camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide camera.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet Phone (3a) Series. First hands-on experience with NEO Gamma.@1x_tech pic.twitter.com/U7vuinDVR7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1894007732044259657">February 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Nothing says it experimented with multiple versions of the Phone 3a design, starting with a camera housing similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>. Later, the phone's design evolved with the camera housing shown off today. There's also a chance that some of the designs showcased in the video influenced the Nothing Phone 3a, which hasn't been shown off yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DEtbQxkQwr7PMj92c7SdPP" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-official-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a showing off the rear camera bump." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DEtbQxkQwr7PMj92c7SdPP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the video, it looks like the Phone 3a Pro's camera bump is quite large. You can't really pick up on it from the back, but it's evident from the side, as you can see in the still image taken from the official Nothing video. Around the gargantuan camera housing, there are three light strips that make up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Glyph Interface</a>.</p>

<p>You can watch the full video above to learn more about the Nothing Phone 3a series. In typical Nothing fashion, the company is tricking out information about its upcoming devices ahead of their March 4 unveiling.</p>

<hr>
<p>Leaks of the upcoming Motorola Razr Plus 2025 keep coming in, one more revealing than the next. This time, we got to see the device in a whole new colorway, thanks to tipster Evan Blass.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1893303427658141936" target="_blank">Taking to X, </a>Blass posted multiple images of the alleged Motorola Razr Plus 2025, also called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra. We get to see the phone in a new hue, dubbed 'Rio Red.' These images didn't just show off the red colorway but also gave us images from multiple angles of what we could expect from the hardware aspect of the device.</p><p>From its looks, the new red Razr will also get a faux leather back, similar to the dark green colorway that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look" target="_blank">leaked</a> earlier this month. There also appears to be a new button on one side, which could be similar to the Quick Button found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1157px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:119.88%;"><img id="gyAYkqE2W4Ek76Lnc4fyAY" name="MotoRazr-Plus-2025-Rio-Red" alt="New colorway of alleged Moto Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gyAYkqE2W4Ek76Lnc4fyAY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1157" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass/X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, from all the leaks collectively we see that this year's edition will look a lot like last year's phone, however in a more polished look with the leather back. But when it comes to specific design changes, previous leaks have hinted that the right edge houses the volume buttons and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner similar to the above images. At the bottom, we see a SIM slot, mic, USB-C port, and speaker next to each other.</p><p>On the display front, the device will supposedly stick with its 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch OLED cover screen like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. And like any new or upcoming phone on the market, the Moto Razr Plus 2025 could be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, with the seven-core version specifically made for foldables.</p><p>On the camera front, the images indicate that it'll have a dual camera array. While we don't know much about the exact specs of the lens, we assume it could be a combination of a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens, like its predecessor.</p><p>Other than that, the clamshell is rumored to get a 4,000mAh battery that will maintain support for 45W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds like its predecessor, which remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market.</p>

<ul><li>A Korean news website recently stated that Samsung Electronics is expected to release a 'double-folding' phone along with the upcoming Galaxy Z series.</li><li>Several industry sources claim that the phone will be sent in for mass production by the end of April.</li><li>Samsung is set to produce 200,000 units of the 'G Fold,' which will allegedly be launched as a small batch to gauge how this will be received.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250224000261" target="_blank">Korean news site</a>, Samsung is planning to launch its rumored multi-fold phone, reportedly dubbed the "Galaxy G Fold," along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 later this year. The site claims that the company is ready to send these devices in for mass production as early as April.</p><p>Looks like several internal sources told the ETNews that "The double-folding multi-fold phone is being developed and produced simultaneously with the Z series" and that it will be released at the same time.</p><p>Additionally, since this is the first multi-fold phone by the company, there seems to be chatter that it will only produce around 200,000 units at first to see how the public will receive this phone. “As this is a form factor that is being introduced [by Samsung] for the first time, only a small quantity will be produced in some countries, just like when the Fold SE was released last year,” an industry insider told ETNews.</p><p>What we have known about the phone up until now is that it will feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>Another important detail that came out of this leak is that this phone may not come with an S Pen. This is likely due to the lack of a digitizer, a magnetic field that allows for a pen-like accessory to interact with the screen.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored" target="_blank">rumor surfaced in January</a> that stated the phone could have a "G-shaped fold style" with an inward folding mechanism. This could mean that the phone will fold the screen inward twice, which could be built off of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/29253/">Flex G screen prototype</a> that surfaced at the CES back in 2022.</p><p>Other specs of this foldable are still unknown. However, if it's impending launch later this July, we could hopefully expect to see some leaks soon.</p>

The Edge Plus (2023), for instance, is one of the best phones that Motorola has ever produced, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2W7YYHM"><strong>Amazon is now selling it with a historic 43% discount, no strings attached.</strong></a> </p><p>Of course, when you pick up a last-gen smartphone, there will always be a few concessions.

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus (2023)</a> may be getting on in years, but it's still an impressive flagship phone with a stunning 165Hz pOLED display, two-day battery, and the efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset. You even get 512GB of storage!</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn't buy it at full price, but thanks to this 43% discount at Amazon, the Edge Plus (2023) has suddenly become one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> on the market. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2W7YYHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ed360a7a-80cb-4975-a64e-ff2feab50541" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an unlocked smartphone with a gorgeous display, over two days of battery life, and solid performance for under $400; you don&apos;t mind using a last-gen device. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a phone with all of the latest features; you take lots of pictures or videos with your smartphone; you can afford a newer device. </p>
<h2 id="is-the-motorola-edge-plus-2023-still-worth-it-2">Is the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) still worth it?</h2>
<p>Despite its age, the Edge Plus (2023) remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> on the market, and this new discount only makes the phone more agreeable for folks who have been on the fence. The 165Hz display is still fantastic to look at, and the two-day battery can easily match the best modern devices from Samsung or Google.</p><p>Sure, if you&apos;re accustomed to using something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Pixel 9 Pro, you&apos;ll probably notice that the Edge Plus&apos; Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset isn&apos;t as fast as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around, but it could easily hold its own against a midrange device like the Google Pixel 8a. Motorola&apos;s software promise also guarantees that the Edge Plus (2023) will receive OS updates through Android 15, so you don&apos;t need to worry about the phone feeling obsolete any time soon.</p><p>If money is no object and you want all of the latest technology and AI features, then the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) isn&apos;t the phone for you. But if you simply want a reliable, stylish device with great performance and battery life for under $500, then you simply can&apos;t beat this Motorola discount.</p>

<ul><li>Google confirmed today (Feb 24) that it will soon fade out its SMS code sign-in method for Gmail in favor of QR codes.</li><li>The company says QR codes will offer a little more robust security as SMS codes are more prone to "phishing."</li><li>Google reiterated the same sentiment during its first introduction of passkeys for personal accounts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Feb 24), Google states it is moving to remove SMS security codes for Gmail in replace of something a little stronger.</p><p>A statement via a Gmail spokesperson to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/23/google-confirms-gmail-to-ditch-sms-code-authentication/">Forbes</a> reads, "...we want to move away from sending SMS messages for authentication." As a result, Google is now interested in displaying a QR code for users attempting to securely sign in to their Gmail accounts. Spokesperson Ross Richendrfer informed the publication that this will begin "over the next few months."</p><p>QR code sign-in will be a part of Google's new vision for "verifying phone numbers." While users will need to scan the code with their phone's camera, the company states this new security method will assist users in two ways.</p><p>First, Google says a QR code will help reduce the risk of phishing as users won't be "tricked into sharing their security codes with a threat actor." The company adds QR codes will also reduce the "reliance" users have on their "phone carrier for anti-abuse protections."</p><p>This second point was highlighted by Richendrfer and Google's Kimberly Samra, who state SMS with a security code isn't all that safe. They add that, with SMS codes, users run the risk of a malicious person gaining a hold of their phone number. If that's done, all "security value of SMS goes away." Google says SMS codes are at the "heart" of many criminal operations around the world, forcing this issue (in its eyes) even more.</p><p>Aside from "over the next few months," Google didn't tell Forbes when users can see this change rollout. However, there will likely be more obvious statements/announcements from Google when it happens. The company teased more will happen "in the near future."</p>

<p>Google's been kicking its security strength up a notch ever since it made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-account-passkey-access-by-default">passkeys the default option</a> for personal accounts. The company touted passkeys were 40% faster than passwords and were developed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">FIDO Alliance</a>. More importantly, passkeys rely solely on your device's various authentication methods like fingerprint, face ID, or PIN. Like what it's trying to do with the SMS, QR code swap, Google says passkeys can't be phished or stolen.</p><p>In short, your credentials won't be stolen over an internet connection.</p><p>Google rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-tools-for-cybersecurity-awareness-month">few more enhanced security features</a> for users a few months before passkeys, involving a Dark Web report. The feature arrived for Gmail and let users lean on it to see if their email addresses had been leaked/exposed on the dark web.</p>

<ul><li>Microsoft is reportedly beginning a test for an "AI Search" mode in Bing, which leverages its Copilot AI software.</li><li>AI Search will see the bot summarized the information it discovered to fulfill your query on a page that simulates a more conversational experience.</li><li>AI Search forgoes website links, similar to what Google was spotted with for its "AI Mode" backed by a "custom" Gemini 2.0 model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft is reportedly beginning to test an experimental search results mode for users backed by its AI software.</p><p>In a statement, Microsoft confirmed the start of this "AI-powered search mode" to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/02/24/exclusive-microsoft-bing-tests-ai-search-that-replaces-blue-links-like-google-ai-mode/">Windows Latest</a>; however, the company declined to explain further (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-bing-copilot-search-google-ai-mode/">9to5Google</a>). The publication turned to an unnamed source, which provided more insight into how Bing's "AI Search" could work once it's rolled out.</p><p>A key aspect of this mode is the engine will leverage Microsoft's Copilot software for a view that's loaded with all the information a user could want for a subject.</p><p>The publication states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">Copilot</a> will "summarize" everything about the user's question without the user needing to scour the web. When receiving answers, AI Search will provide a brief explainer before diving into organized pieces of information. The post states when asking about the safety of "Windows 11 24H2," AI Search broke things down by "update safety, risks, and compatibility checks."</p><p>Bing's AI Search view will supposedly be clean, offering only your question with the AI and the results that follow. Early tests show the right side will offer tabs for "Images" and "Video," while the UI's bottom gives you suggested (relevant) follow-up questions and the ability to write one yourself.</p><p>The publication's source highlights another key aspect of "AI Search:" the removal of all website links. Supposedly, the Copilot AI will do all of the heavy lifting, sourcing information for users and displaying it in a digestible format.</p><p>Moreover, Copilot will cite <em>where </em>it got its information at the end of its summary. Users can click on them for fact-checking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-global-language-support-expansion">similar to what Google's done</a> with AI Overviews.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y" name="copilot-windows-11-wc.jpg" alt="Microsoft Copilot with Bing Chat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest thing about Microsoft's confirmed "AI Search" development is that it mirrors what Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-mode-gemini-backed-search-reported">is reportedly creating for Search</a>. Earlier this month, a report surfaced stating Google was working on an "AI Mode" for Search, which mirrors a typical conversation with Gemini. This "alternate" mode will supposedly offer organized answers with defined headers for "complex questions."</p><p>Users can swap to this mode, likely in the same manner as you would switch to see image results or news.</p><p>The rumored example of Google's AI Mode is reminiscent of what we've seen rumored for Microsoft Bing. The page will be void of site links, only offering the information discovered/summarized by a "custom" version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0</a> model.</p><p>Regarding Microsoft, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">launched Copilot</a> in January 2024 with OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 models as its backbone. It's also worth noting Microsoft nabbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-deepmind-co-founder-joins-microsoft">Google's DeepMind co-founder</a> last year to further its new journey into AI. Mustafa Suleyman was brought on to oversee everything dealing with Microsoft AI, meaning what's coming up via "AI Search" could be the fruit of their hard work.</p>

<p><em><strong>Milo asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why are smartphones not getting better? It seems like we have so many places to get better, but all phones are essentially the same now.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Milo, and thanks for asking! This is a polarizing issue, but I can see where you're going — almost every phone is a rectangular sandwich of glass running software that does the same things as other phones. It seems like they all came from a clone factory.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of people are going to disagree. This is because some phones are outliers, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> or phones with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-samsung-ditch-the-s-pen-in-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">S Pen</a>, and the small software features can make a big difference for the people who use them regularly.</p><p>Still, if you put 100 new phones in a box, most of them are just like the others, so I get it.</p>

<p>There are reasons for this, of course. A phone maker has two goals when it offers a new product — it wants it to be popular and sell in the millions, and it wants to make a bit of profit from every unit sold. To do this, they have to offer what they're sure people want to buy.</p><p>If you look at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9</a>, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13,</a> or any other "normal" smartphone, you can see they seem alike, especially at a glance. However, the small differences add up and are what makes people choose one over the other.</p><p>If you want to take amazing photos without fiddling with anything, buy a Pixel 9. If you want to do the same for video, buy an iPhone 16. Want the ultimate set of specs and hardware for a good price? The OnePlus 13 is for you. And, of course, the Galaxy S25 further refines the software people love with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI</a>. There are differences even though they seem the same at a glance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="mCa445XtsS8U6LknvYxZSG" name="blackberry-key2" alt="BlackBerry KEY2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mCa445XtsS8U6LknvYxZSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But there are other phones out there, especially on the Android side. It's hard to say the industry is stagnant when you can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally">a phone that folds out three ways</a>, a phone that flips open like a Star Trek Communicator, or a phone that silos an integrated smart stylus. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">Techno Phantom Ultimate 2</a> (these names are getting terrible) or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> (see?) aren't anything like a Pixel or an iPhone. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and its S Pen are very different from the base model S25 or any slab phone.</p><p>I think phone makers <em>are</em> innovating but in a different way than they used to. We see fewer gimmicks like an IR blaster or a tiny ticker screen and more focus on the things that seem to sell. You and I might have loved the IR blaster or the LG V10's small ticker tape screen, but they didn't add to the overall sales numbers in a way that justifies their inclusion. And that's the real deciding factor.</p>

<p>Phone makers are also working on ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">make their phones thinner</a> and batteries that last longer. These aren't flashy innovations that stand out from the pack, but they're something that people demand. Remember, making a thin device even thinner or packing a bigger battery in a tighter space isn't easy.</p><p>We all won't appreciate the design and hardware innovation in the smartphone world of the past few years. I want a thicker phone with a big <em>removable</em> battery, made of quality plastic with enough bezel to hold it without my big, thick thumbs hitting the screen. Better yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-key2-second-opinion">BlackBerry</a> could rise from the ashes and build me what I loved to use.</p><p>None of this is happening because what I want isn't as important as what most people want. I think phone makers are delivering what people want, and these small differences make a world of difference when it comes to using your phone.</p><p>Eventually, some company will fire off something nerdy, goofy, and weird that enthusiasts love. If it sells, then the other companies will copy it. Until then, we'll see the small differences and minor revisions between models to make them consumer-friendly.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have revealed the renderings for the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and a few of its changes.</li><li>The foldable is supposedly slimming down as Samsung removes its S Pen digitizer while also sporting a larger 8.2-inch internal display and 6.5-inch cover.</li><li>A recent South Korea report suggested Samsung was moving away from the digitizer to shave roughly 0.6mm off the device's thickness.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to debut later this summer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting the week is a pack of alleged renderings depicting Samsung's upcoming book-style foldable.</p><p>The leaks were surfaced by X tipster OnLeaks in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Android Headlines</a> who've compiled a list of its supposed specifications. According to the tipster, the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature a "larger" 8.2-inch internal and 6.5-inch external display. Additionally, early rumors claim there's a slight dimension change, which could mean the "front screen" is "even wider" than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>Overall, the leaked renders show a Galaxy Z Fold 7 that looks pretty identical to the Fold 6. The cover display boasts relatively thin bezels while its internal display offers even slimmer borders.</p><p>The back of the device is rumored to receive an upgrade as the tipster claims the primary lens will arrive at 200MP. Rumors add it could be joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto with a 10MP selfie camera. The internal display is supposedly receiving a 4MP UDC (under-display camera).</p><p>The leaked renders don't indicate much change for the rear panel. The triple camera array remains as a vertical, pill-shaped housing for the three lenses. That housing also provides a small bump, as the post claims the device rises to 9.5mm when factoring in the camera array.</p><p>Without it, the device is 9mm in thickness when folded; however, the tipster states the phone is only 4.5mm when unfolded. Curiously, the renderings don't show a slot for the Fold 7's S Pen.</p>

<p>Other specification rumors state the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and a 4,400mAh battery. The device is expected to launch later this summer, perhaps in "mid-July," per the recent leak.</p><p>There are some specifications here that have remained consistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-design-s-pen-digitizer-south-korean-rumors">following a South Korea report</a> on Samsung's planned changes. It was stated earlier this month that the Korean OEM was considering a display increase for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, potentially pushing its internal screen to 8 inches while its cover display could see a 6.5-inch change. More importantly, creating a slimmer book-style device was also a key aspect.</p><p>The company has played with the removal of its S Pen digitizer, meaning consumers could no longer store/charge the stylus within the device. It was rumored that this would shave off roughly 0.6mm. As previously mentioned, the current renderings don't show an S Pen slot, so this <em>might </em>be the way the next Fold will go.</p><p>As a result, Samsung could make the S Pen a little bulkier and with a series of "improved" functions.</p><p>A chunkier S Pen was reiterated today (Feb 24) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-7s-fan-favorite-feature-is-here-to-stay">in a separate leak</a> that claimed Samsung is working on an upgraded stylus with a revamped tip for better writing. It was speculated that this newer version may only work with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oppo just unveiled its latest creation, the Find N5, which is the slimmest foldable phone they’ve ever made, and for the global markets. However, it seems like Oppo might not be expanding its release to other countries like Europe.</p><p>The company has confirmed in a statement given to a YouTuber, The Tech Chap (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/22/oppo-find-n5-europe-global-launch/">9to5Google</a>), alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/news/smartphones/faltbares-smartphone-das-oppo-find-n5-kommt-nicht-nach-europa.91488/">ComputerBase</a> publication indicating that it isn’t bringing its thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, to Europe. It also means the device is highly unlikely to be available in Germany as well.</p><p>Here’s the statement given by Oppo:</p>
<p>“At OPPO, we carefully tailor our product launchers to each region based on in-depth market research and strategic priorities. The Find N5 will not be launching in Europe. Instead, in Q1 2025, we will introduce the Reno13 series across Europe on February 24, offering consumers more choices with cutting-edge AI features and stylish, trend-forward designs. Stay tuned for updates.”</p>

<p>The latest update should be quite disappointing for consumers across Europe and the U.K. region as the Find N5 has been one of the most anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that the tech industry has witnessed in recent times. Plus, Oppo’s sibling OnePlus has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-not-launching-the-open-2-is-a-massive-win-for-samsung">recently announced</a> that it isn’t bringing any foldable this year, closing the gates of the OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>It has also been the highly anticipated device, and ever since the Find N5 surfaced on the web, rumors were floating around that it could be dubbed the OnePlus Open 2 in global markets including Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to predecessor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Oppo Find N5 made its debut on February 20 in Singapore, marking a global launch. Even in the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/find-n5-global-launch/">press release</a>, the company noted that the Find N5 “marks a new phase in Oppo’s global expansion.” On the contrary, the device is skipping markets like the U.K., the U.S., and Europe.</p><p>Other than the availability aspect of the Find N5, the foldable phone turned out to be a great handset, making the competition sweat. The device’s ultra-thin design, ability to easily hold and use, and no visible crease, alongside a great display, battery, and IPX9 ingress protection, happen to be the key takeaways of the Find N5, which is about to go on sale in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a is expected to arrive next month. Despite many leaks, hands-on photos, specifications leaks, and so on, the latest one is out of the box.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> was surprisingly showcased in a recent Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge leak video. The video, which has now been deleted —showcased the alleged Galaxy S25 Edge camera samples in which the Pixel 9a was supposedly lying around a table.</p>

<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/22/pixel-9a-real-world-leak/">9to5Google</a> points out, the Pixel 9a was spotted for only a few seconds in, and according to the publication's screenshots,  it certainly appears to be Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a> featuring a pill-shaped dual camera visor flushed into the rear panel — as we've known from previous leaks. This means Google is letting go of its usual Pixels’ popular raised camera visor. The search giant’s “G” logo was also visible on the back panel indicating the same design as we have seen in several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/massive-pixel-9a-leak-reveals-official-looking-renders-color-options">leaked renders</a> and hands-on images.</p>

<p>On the other hand, another leaked hands-on video (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/latest-pixel-9a-hands-on-leak-shows-a-very-cheap-looking-handset/">9to5Google</a>) of the Pixel 9a has emerged, giving us a closer look at the mid-range handset. Since the phone doesn't look much more attractive than its predecessors, the choice to use a pill-shaped camera visor instead of the raised camera bar design should either help or go the other way for the public when they choose to buy it.</p><p>The new visor is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-major-specs-render-design-changes-leaked">tipped</a> to include a 48MP primary lens, accompanying a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">expected specs</a> per the earlier leaks include a Tensor G4 SoC, a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10 Plus support. We might be seeing 128GB and 256GB storage options, and a 5100mAh battery capacity powering the handset. The device is also tipped to start at $499.</p>

<p>Turns out, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn’t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">ditching the S Pen</a> after all, but it’s tipped to be getting a bit of a makeover.

Earlier rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-design-s-pen-digitizer-south-korean-rumors">suggested the S Pen might get scaled back on the Fold 7</a>, with Samsung possibly trimming down its features to make the phone itself thinner. It seemed like a classic design trade-off (slimmer device, less capable stylus). But now, it looks like that might not be the case after all.</p><p>On the flip side, new reports are hinting that Samsung is working on a revamped S Pen packed with more features. While the details are still under wraps, the stylus is said to be a bit thicker.</p><p>This change might also tie into rumors of a new stylus tip in the works, as mentioned by the same source.</p><p>If the tipster’s info is on point, the new S Pen might not work with older Galaxy Z Fold models. At the same time, there’s still some uncertainty about whether the stylus will lose any features.</p><p>Samsung is rumored to start S Pen production in June. If tradition holds, Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> will make their debut at a Galaxy Unpacked event in July.</p><p>While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 might not completely reinvent the foldable wheel, it’s shaping up to bring some pretty tempting upgrades. Rumor has it we’ll see a sleeker hinge and a less noticeable screen crease, among others.</p><p>Even with all the upgrades, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be playing it safe, focusing more on fine-tuning than breaking new ground. Rumor has it that the phone will stick with reliable hardware, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, instead of pushing for anything too radical.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung threw us a curveball by showing off the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate"> Galaxy S25 Edge </a>at the recent Unpacked event. However, people present there were not allowed to get too close to the phone, let alone get a hands-on of the device.</p><p>YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6XJPnji3o" target="_blank">Alexis Garza</a> was lucky enough to take this new phone for a spin. In a now-deleted video, Garza shared a short tease of the alleged device, confirming the supposed specs of what we can expect from Samsung's upcoming slim phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-edge-youtube-video-3528938/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>The publication further adds that in the video, Garza seems to have placed the Galaxy S25 Edge next to the unfolded Galaxy Z Fold 6, which measures 5.6mm in thickness when unfolded. The S25 Edge visibly seems a tad thicker than the Z Fold 6, which means it could be just under 6mm.</p><p>Still measuring thinner than the Galaxy S25 lineup, the S25 Edge's specs were also shown in the video with the help of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finalwire.aida64&hl=en"> AIDA64 app</a>, which provides hardware and software information as well as diagnostic information for Android devices. The AIDA64 app says that the Galaxy S25 Edge will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, similar to the Galaxy S25 series, and will have 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First hands-on of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge!

<p>Other than that, it will allegedly support Bluetooth 5.4 and have a 4,000mAh battery, which is similar to the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> model. The app spilled some details about the expected camera array of the device, revealing three 12MP cameras. Since we know that the phone will have two rear cameras, the third sensor could refer to the selfie camera.</p><p>According to Android Authority, the AIDA64 shows the resolution at which images are saved and doesn't take into account the sensor’s full resolution, so the phone could still feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs">200MP primary camera</a>, as rumored, and a 50MP ultrawide.</p><p>While we can't fully corroborate all the details in the video since it was taken down, we could piece together what to expect out of Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Regardless, we anticipate knowing more about the phone closer to the device's official release, which is expected later this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You probably didn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-appstore-good-and-bad">Amazon's Android Appstore</a> because very few people do. Outside of Kindle and FireTV devices, the Amazon Appstore is simply an afterthought; one that isn't as good as what you already have installed from Google. That's surely a big reason why the company is dropping the stand-alone version for "regular" Android devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-will-suspend-support-for-its-appstore-on-android">Come August 20, it's gone</a>. I wish it weren't.</p><p>Not because I think you get a better experience from Amazon than you do from Google or because I can't find what I want on the Play Store. I hate to see it happen because it's a giant tech company with seemingly infinite resources that <em>isn't</em> Google.</p>
<p>Normally, I would say one faceless tech super-corporation is the same as any other. That's still true; these companies prosper and seem to have no regard for what is best for consumers. This is a special case, though, because Google is in a special position when it comes to the smartphone.</p><p>Google owns this space. You might look around and see so many people using an iPhone that this sounds silly, but close to eight of every 10 phones worldwide use Google's Android OS. Apple has a foothold in a few places, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android phones</a> are what powers most of the world.</p><p>I don't want to see any company in that unique position get stronger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM" name="amazon-prime-box.jpg" alt="Amazon Prime Box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon is equally as bad in many ways. It's a business designed to find ways to profit from us all and they're really good at it. If we were talking about commerce or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">online shopping</a>, I would find the same reasons why Amazon should be reigned in. However, we are talking about smartphones and the Android platform in particular.</p><p>Amazon is one of the few companies that could have found a way to compete with Google. This wasn't one of the company's primary goals and the Amazon Appstore is in place to bolster Amazon's own Android-powered devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-you-should-buy-amazon-fire-hd-8-plus-instead-echo-show">Kindle Tablet</a>. If the company had wanted, it could have invested and tried things that would attract consumers to its storefront, stealing potential purchases and control away from Google.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead" target="_blank">alternative app markets</a> for Android, and some of them are very good; they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://f-droid.org/en/" target="_blank">more open and more secure,</a> and that's tough to pull off. None of these companies are in a position to make a difference in how Google exercises control. At least not the same way Amazon is. And control is 100% the meat of the issue.</p><p>Google is not your friend. I know sometimes it feels that way, and the informal language and friendly onboarding make Google seem like someone you would want to hang out with. It really isn't. As a U.S. corporation, it has only one purpose: to maximize profits for shareholders. This is because the law demands it do everything legal to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/shareholder-value-purpose-corporation" target="_blank">maximize the value of the corporation</a>. In other words, Android only exists to make Alphabet more valuable, and every decision reflects this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.40%;"><img id="wyPkQmB8xRSNJyNDBwmnPo" name="Linux Distributions" alt="The top Linux distros of 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wyPkQmB8xRSNJyNDBwmnPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1144" height="691" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also isn't nearly as open as the company likes to pretend. To use Android, you only have to download and build it. To use Android<sup>tm</sup> you have to follow a strict set of rules; yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines#:~:text=The%20%22Android%22%20name%2C%20the,the%20Android%20Open%20Source%20Project." target="_blank">Google has trademarked the Android name</a>.</p><p>That's not a bad thing. Without some sort of control, Android would turn into "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions" target="_blank">Linux on the desktop,</a>" where it seems disjointed, and each instance is different from the others. Imagine trying to use a phone where the manufacturer could do anything they wanted to do with the software.</p><p>There has to be some sort of balance. Google can not be allowed to do whatever it wants with no regard for the consumer or the competition. We've seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">governmental scrutiny</a> Google has come under quite a few times, but this usually only addresses the most grievous issues. We also need some healthy — and worthy — competition to keep Google in check.</p><p>And now we're going to have less of it.</p>

Never having owned the Casio GMW-B5000 that it's based on — or any Casio watch — the nostalgia factor never affected me. I never expected Casio to offer to send me one, nor did I expect to like it so much. But here we are!</p>

<p>The "Casio ring watch" isn't a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, which sets it up for easy ridicule. The stainless steel design is impressive, but all its heavy components are designed to tell the time and start/stop a stopwatch with tiny buttons, on a screen too small to read easily. It's not breaking new ground.</p><p>Compare that to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> that tracks heart rate, stress, workouts, sleep, and a dozen other metrics while weighing significantly less (16g vs. 3-5g). Putting it in the same conversation with a novelty mini-watch isn't really fair to Casio, especially since both smart rings cost $230 more, but it's a natural comparison to make as smart rings grow in popularity.</p>

<p>Now that I'm seeing Casio's ring in person — instead of looking at press photos that emphasize the display — I have to admit that it's cute, even without the nostalgia factor. It's about the size of a high school class ring, only less garish (apologies to everyone I just offended), and the ridged steel look draws the eye.</p><p>It only ships in one size, but it comes with a few translucent inserts to shrink it down; thankfully, it fits snugly on my right ring finger with one. It's on the noticeably heavy side, so I don't wear it while running. But Casio must have decided it was a necessary trade-off to get the steel, watch-like look and two-year battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p7gPJ8Lu2cyN7hqFER3k3g" name="Casio-smart-ring-display" alt="A close-up of the Casio CRW001-1 ring watch's default time display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7gPJ8Lu2cyN7hqFER3k3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The grayscale screen only catches the eye at a direct visual angle; otherwise, it just looks like a flat, glossy layer above the metal, so it's not distracting. I assumed people would side-eye me for wearing a dorky mini-watch, but you don't notice that aesthetic unless you're quite close. Even then, the one or two comments I've received are more out of interest and curiosity than open derision.</p><p>My recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch fashion contest</a> proved that I don't really know what regular, non-techy people think is attractive in wearables; maybe people are silently judging my tastes. But this ring will certainly appeal to a niche crowd that loves the bulky Casio or Garmin Instinct look and already has heart rate tracking from another device.</p>

<p>Frankly, most smart rings besides Casio's look the same to me; their designs are in a race towards getting as skinny and low-key as possible, but they're all these 1-inch-wide metallic bands with a few gold or silver palette swaps. Even this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">$1,500 luxury smart ring</a> looks fairly generic, aside from the 18K gold or PT950 platinum materials.</p><p>I've also noticed how many smart rings are pushing to become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade devices</a>, with FDA-approved health sensors meant to target B2B sales and impress doctors instead of consumers. Basically, smart rings aren't <em>fun</em>; they're meant to be taken seriously and to blend in. Everything they give you is passive data that requires staring at your phone.</p><p>In that context, the budget-priced Casio "smart" ring feels like a nice change of pace. I don't need a stopwatch timer very often; a countdown timer would be more useful. But I certainly don't mind having a way to check the time whenever I get smartwatch fatigue and take mine off for the day. It does <em>one</em> gimmick; otherwise, it's just there to look pretty, not sell health subscriptions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="naMCo5feQuGV5VZduR7Kyf" name="Casio-smart-ring-stopwatch" alt="A close-up of the Casio CRW001-1 ring watch on the stopwatch setting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naMCo5feQuGV5VZduR7Kyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The stopwatch function on the Casio smart ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think it's worth getting too philosophical about a 50th-anniversary, limited-time device that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.CRW-001-1/">already sold out</a> (though you can sign up for in-stock alerts at that link). We may not see anything like this again, and I'm sure most people would find it more dorky than cool. But I wouldn't mind if we started seeing more <em>limited</em> smart rings that emphasize unique designs over functionality.</p><p>Look at Circular Ring, the rare smart ring with a haptic motor for silent wake-ups, notification buzzes, and even subtle guidance for meditation. We liked the concept, but Circular had to ditch haptics in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Ring 2</a> to add an FDA-approved ECG, until they find a way to fit both. That might be the right business decision, but the need to offer competitive health and wellness data above all else makes the field more monotonous.</p><p>Everyone thinks of smart rings as mobile, 24/7 doctor's offices. But we should shake off that impulse to judge any rings that <em>don't</em> offer health tracking as useless. After all, many people think smart rings are pointless <em>because</em> their smartwatch already tracks the same things.</p><p>I don't know what these new, non-health smart rings would do, necessarily, besides this mini-stopwatch ring. Off the top of my head, we could see ones with phone-connected haptics for alarms and notifications, NFC-based contactless payments, UWB to unlock a specific digital car key or house smart lock, fall detection for seniors and the disabled, and so on.</p><p>Because they'll focus on one or two key things instead of offering every health sensor and the kitchen sink, maybe smart rings can be (A) more affordable and (B) more aesthetically distinct, like the Casio ring. And these niche models won't be in such strict competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OPPO just launched the Find N5, an incredibly thin foldable phone that should have Samsung shaking in its boots. The phone is about as thin as a standard unfolding smartphone but with much more display. In fact, when closed, the Find N5 feels no different than a regular phone yet still manages to fit plenty of flagship specs and features. It feels too good to be true, and yet it still sets a new standard for phones that I hope to see other OEMs strive for.</p><p>I’ve been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> for about a week now, and while I still prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> to large foldables, what OPPO has done here is something special. This phone is pretty much the full package; it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> with phenomenal performance, a pretty great set of Hasselblad cameras, impressive displays, and a battery that’s larger than the unit in the much thicker Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>That last part is especially important because OPPO is following Honor’s example by launching a very thin foldable, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">calling out Samsung</a> for its embarrassingly thick phone. The company highlights that the thinness was partly a result of its battery technology that recently made its way to the OnePlus 13, sporting 10% silicon to produce a denser battery unit that doesn’t compromise on capacity or charging speed.</p><p>This is a big deal, one that spans not only candybar phones and the current batch of foldables flooding the market but could also have far-reaching effects on more niche form factors and other device categories.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO and OnePlus have shown that with this new way of building batteries, there are essentially two ways they can go about implementing it. Clearly, the OPPO Find N5 took the "less is more" route by aiming for a very thin phone. This is important because we've seen that thin phones are set to make a comeback, and the more battery we can stuff into them, the better.</p><p>This has been a point of contention for some when it comes to upcoming devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. Even among Android Central staff, there seems to be a divide between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">those who want a thin phone </a>and those who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">concerned about the sacrifices needed</a> to get there. I'm somewhat in the middle, leaning toward now wanting to deal with a battery that will only get me through half a day of use (I'm past the days of using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs">rumors of the Edge</a> also don't leave us with much confidence that Samsung has it figured out, although we still won't know much until the official launch, whenever that is.</p><p>Of course, Samsung isn't the only one shooting for thin. Apple is rumored to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-renders-give-us-a-close-look-at-the-possible-design-of-apples-rumored-super-slim-model">very slim iPhone</a> set to launch this year, which gives credence to the return of the thin phone trend of years past. After all, Apple rarely does anything without a ton of market research and a solid plan, so either this is something that customers are yearning for, or it's something Apple <em>wants</em> them to want.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> went with the "more is more" route. Instead of aiming for thinness, the phone arrived with a battery that's 600mAh larger than its predecessor. That's no small feat, especially given that the phone is <em>still</em> thinner and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>What this tells me is that companies may no longer have to choose between providing a svelte design or good battery life; you can have your cake and eat it, too. Of course, it may take a generation or two before other companies actually catch up. Batter tech is slow to evolve and catch on, and Samsung learned the hard way that rocking the boat in that department can lead to some explosive outcomes.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-bottom-view-alt.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 bottom view comaprison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this is a great way to mark the OPPO Find N5 as the thinnest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the implications go beyond OPPO and the devices we currently have on the market.</p><p>Multi-fold devices have begun cropping up, mostly as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">concept phones</a>, but with one commercially available device from Huawei hitting the global market. It's a magnificent feat of engineering, one that seems like overkill until you get one in your hands. You start to see the benefit of having a phone that could turn into a full-blown tablet... that is until you close the thing.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Huawei Mate XT</a> is nearly 13mm when folded, which admittedly feels pretty ridiculous, even compared to the 12.1mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. What's more is that Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">rumored to have a multi-fold phone</a> in the works, with the company showing off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-foldable-display-concepts-ces-2022">various concept devices</a> over the years. Unfortunately, given Samsung's track record with foldable design and the downward trend of its sales in the segment, I could see this being dead on arrival. No one wants a 14 or 15mm-thick phone protruding out of their pockets.</p><p>This is why the Find N5 gets me excited. I can see this as the precursor to an eventual multi-fold phone from the company, with OPPO shaving a few millimeters off the 12.8mm thickness of the Mate XT. That would help make this new type of foldable a more palatable option for consumers in the market for a versatile smartphone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1482px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="beejucHabxp52LGyttbNwj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-2.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/beejucHabxp52LGyttbNwj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1482" height="834" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other devices and form factors also stand to gain from this. We've already seen what OnePlus and OPPO can achieve with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">OnePlus Watch 3</a>/OPPO Watch X2, which can last a full five days in smart mode and 16 days in power save mode. That's more than any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, and it's the result of OnePlus and OPPO squeezing in a much larger battery without the watch becoming too unwieldy.</p><p>I'm particularly excited about how this can improve flip phones. Despite being my favorite smartphone form factor, I recently laid out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-android-oems-can-improve-flip-phones">my grievances with flip phones</a> and the compromises that come with them, including the thick was of the devices when folded. After all, what's the point of having a compact phone when it's literally double the thickness of a normal smartphone when folded?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During a briefing at the Find N5 launch, OPPO hinted that the advancements we see in its battery tech could arrive in a future flip phone. And while we have no official word on a long-awaited successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a>, this all but tells me that we could be in for a thinner, more impressive flip phone sooner than I had hoped. Motorola had better watch out!</p>
<h2 id="no-more-excuses-2">No more excuses</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been very vocal about making foldables mainstream and has invested a lot of money into making that happen. The Z Fold and Z Flip series had a few years of impressive growth thanks to refined design, enhanced durability, and improved durability. However, we've seen growth slow down lately, which seems to coincide with Samsung's perceived slowdown in innovation.</p><p>As a result, Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">reportedly lowering its shipping targets</a> for its upcoming foldables. However, its recent quarterly earnings report hints that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-q4-2024-earnings-report-detailed">Samsung is confident</a> that its foldable offerings this year could help drive more demand as the competition seemingly surpasses it in terms of design, innovation, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://huaweicentral.com/huawei-dethrones-samsung-as-global-foldable-leader-in-q4-2024/">shipments</a>.</p><p>There's really no reason the largest Android OEM should be ceding its foldable crown to others. However, after the launch of the Find N5, there's a lot riding on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to bring something exciting.</p><p>With OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-not-launching-the-open-2-is-a-massive-win-for-samsung">skipping a 2025 launch</a> of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> successor, Samsung now has the perfect opening to take back its foldable crown without too much competition getting in the way. And with any luck, Samsung will take a page from competitors like OPPO when it comes to design to give us thin, durable, and exciting foldable phones. Because if it won't, we can be sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/only-apple-can-save-foldables-now-after-oneplus-bows-out-this-year">Apple's eventual foldable will</a>.</p>

Well, it's interesting if you enjoy eBooks or copyright law, or just like to watch huge tech companies do stupid things. You might even enjoy all three; if so you hit the jackpot.</p><p>On one side we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-kindle-users-to-loose-download-transfer-via-usb-feature">Amazon cracking down</a> on people who move Kindle books to a computer. There are legitimate reasons you might want to do this, but one of the biggest reasons is so that you can strip the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle</a> DRM away from the document and can use any reader software to enjoy your book.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>The issue is that once you've stripped away that DRM (Digital Rights Management) you can also upload and share that work with someone who didn't give Amazon any money for it. That's stealing and against the law no matter how you or I feel about it. More importantly to Amazon, it means the company loses a potential sale.</p>
<p>On the other side, we have Meta. You know, the company that used to be Facebook but has morphed into an AI company that happens to own WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram among others. Their AI is pretty good, too. On par with the offerings from Google and OpenAI, Meta's Llama AI models are open source and used by other AI companies like DeepSeek.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1888019174133276846" target="_blank">According to court records</a>, Meta allegedly illegally pirated 82TB of DRM-free eBooks to train <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama</a>. That's 8.2e+13 bytes of data, a number that's basically unfathomable to normal people who don't love math. These court records show that Meta knew it was wrong, did it anyway, and made jokes about it.</p><p>Way back in October of 2022 senior AI researchers said things like "<em>I don’t think we should use pirated material. I really need to draw a line here</em>” and “<em>Using pirated material should be beyond our ethical threshold.</em>” One even added, “<em>SciHub, ResearchGate, LibGen are basically like PirateBay or something like that, they are distributing content that is protected by copyright and they’re infringing it</em>.”</p><p>After some gentle nudging from Mark Zuckerberg himself, things changed. The company took steps to make sure the torrenting couldn't be traced back to Meta's network infrastructure and began sailing under the black flag.</p><p>The tone of the messages between employees changed from stoic refusal to things like "<em>torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right </em>😂." Emoji included.</p>

<p>It's alleged — remember Meta hasn't been found guilty of anything yet — that this shows both evidence of the unlawful activity and how Meta took deliberate steps to try and get away with it. The case against Meta is still ongoing so we have no idea if the writers who are suing the company will be able to get some sort of satisfaction.</p><p>In any case, Android Central has reached out to Meta for a comment regarding the allegations against it and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>"Stealing" content to train AI isn't anything new. Google scrapes every bit of free content on the internet and much of it is used to train <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini models</a> which often plagiarize the actual source. OpenAI and Microsoft have faced several lawsuits similar to the current one against Meta, including an ongoing case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement" target="_blank">brought by the New York Times</a> for "billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages" for using millions of NYT articles to build a competitor without paying for it.</p><p>Nvidia allegedly scrapes "A human lifetime" of video every day to train its AI models according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/nvidia-ai-scraping-foundational-model-cosmos-project/" target="_blank">documents leaked to 404 Media</a>., and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> is being investigated for allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6" target="_blank">obtaining content from ChatGPT illegally</a>. That's a lot of "allegedly" but still very concerning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.59%;"><img id="uKWdVbe7mVRsXyReqjpcqL" name="piracy-kindle" alt="An AI-generated picture of a pirate holding a Kindle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uKWdVbe7mVRsXyReqjpcqL.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="559" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text"><em><strong>yargh</strong></em> </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels like all these tech giants do whatever the hell they please when it comes to copyright, but you shouldn't do the same. The financial penalties are peanuts to companies like Google or Meta but would ruin the average person. We've seen that happen; pirating music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_piracy#:~:text=The%20RIAA%2C%20a%20powerful%20lobby,to%20a%20dentist%20like%20me%22." target="_blank">can cost you $150,000 for every song</a> you download illegally.</p><p>Equally important is the message this gives. If it's OK for a company like Meta to steal eBooks then you can do the same thing, though the reality is that both are wrong. The difference is that if you have a huge war chest and legal team, you can get away with it.</p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do. I try very hard to pay for all the content I consume, but if it's not easy to pay for it I've fired up a torrent client to get what I wanted or used a web archive to get around a paywall. I think most people are the same.</p><p>In the long run, someone will find another way to strip Kindle DRM, eBook piracy sites aren't going away, and Meta will fight and appeal until Zuck gets a slap on the wrist for doing something that would financially ruin you or me.</p><p>The world keeps turning.</p>

According to Android Central's Michael Hicks, the "active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity," takes it a notch higher than its predecessor.</p><p>The wearable has a 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display and a stainless steel exterior with a Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel. What's more, is that the smartwatch has a dual chipset— the Snapdragon W5 and the new BES2800 MCU Efficiency which helps the WearOS 5 accomplish complex tasks.</p><p>"It not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life," OnePlus added.</p><p>The company builds on the watch's battery, promising a 5-day battery life on Smart mode, which Nick Sutrich said has surpassed this limit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">after spending 10 days with the watch</a>, thanks to the larger 631mAh Silicon NanoStack Battery.</p><p>The Watch 3 comes with a new feature called the 60S Health check-in that will give users a physical and mental health report in just 60 seconds and also gains an IP68 rating which allows the device to be submerged in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. The OnePlus Watch 3 will have two colorways: Obsidian Titanium and Emerald Titanium and is priced at $330.</p><p>While focusing on what's built into the watch, OnePlus seems to have missed out on a tiny detail. A user on Reddit noticed a minor error with the wearable, where the company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China," on the first batch that went out. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china" target="_blank">Admitting its mistake</a> OnePlus took to X (formerly Twitter) to put all the chatter to rest around the hilarious typo, stating it was completely unintentional.</p><p>"A typo slipped through and made its way onto your shiny new OnePlus Watch 3," the company said. And if users seem to have received one that says "Meda" on the wearable, they have one of two options. They can either keep it as a 'super limited edition' or return it to the company for a brand new one — minus the typo of course.</p>

Measuring just 8.92mm when folded and 4.21mm when open, the OPPO Find N5 comes with a 6.62-inch cover display and an 8.12-inch inner screen.</p><p>The most powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, is at the core of this foldable which is paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Out of the box it runs on ColorOS 15.0.1, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Giving it a 4.5-star rating, Jonnaagadda said, "Once you combine all of that (hardware) with fluid software and meaningful multitasking features, it's no wonder that the Find N5 is now my favorite foldable phone."</p><p>When it comes to the cameras,  it looks similar to its predecessor with curved corners— but it is so sleek that the array barely peeps out of the back panel, with 9.0mm thickness.  It comes with a 50MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens for 3x optical zoom. Selfies and video calls are captured with 8MP front cameras on both the outer and inner displays.</p><p>The phone comes with a 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W wired charging and 50W wireless. The Find N5 will cost around $1,867, but won't be seen in the U.S. anytime soon.</p>

In a YouTube video showcasing the device, Nothing says that the Phone 3a series will have a 50MP main camera sensor, an 8MP Ultra-wide, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the rear.</p><p>Additionally, it will showcase another 50 MP front camera consisting of a periscope telephoto lens, that is said to come with a 3x optical zoom and a 6x "in-sensor zoom".</p><p>While boasting about the above, in the same YouTube video, the company mistakingly compared the lower-quality ultra-wide camera of the Phone 16 Pro Max to the Nothing Phone 3a's main camera. After several viewers spotted this potentially misleading comparison, Nothing said this was made as a result of an editing mistake and wasn't intentional. It then put out the following statement in a pinned YouTube comment and on Nothing's community page:</p><p>"Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilization comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!"</p>

While Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> is expected to power the Pixel 9a. Colorways seem to be consistent across previous leaks, like Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris. Lastly, the publication suggests the Pixel 9a could see a price hike in the U.S. starting at $499.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple is now offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a new budget iPhone</a> with something really cool inside of it. I'm not talking about Apple's AI features; the iPhone 16e and its binned SoC prove that Apple could offer more features to older phones if it wanted to do it. I'm talking about something most people don't care about — the modem.</p><p>The 16e is the first iPhone that uses Apple's new in-house C1 5G modem, which the company developed after a lot of expensive R&D and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">buying out Intel's 5G business</a>. It's a modem that doesn't match up very well with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm's</a>, at least on paper.</p>
<p>This is a bigger deal than you might think because Apple's C1 has no support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">millimeter-wave 5G</a> frequencies. That means two things — it will never get the hyper-fast 5G speeds we were promised and you might have seen yourself, and the network coverage in many places will be sub-par or fallback to LTE (4G).</p><p>This is because most of the technology to power a millimeter-wave modem is from Qualcomm. The company invented or re-invented it and marketed it in a way that it has become almost mandatory in North America. A lot of network tech is Qualcomm's and I imagine Apple has liscensed a good bit of it for its in-house offering, but it either declined to pay for better millimeter-wave support or Qualcomm is unwilling to license it at a cost Apple finds fair.</p>

<p>I have no special affinity for Apple products but I don't like what I'm seeing here. On one hand, you might think that this proves Apple doesn't need Qualcomm so other manufacturers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apples-c1-modem-in-the-iphone-16e-is-proof-that-we-dont-need-qualcomm-for-5g">might not need the company, either</a>. That's true if you're OK with a sub-par product with missing features found in many devices at all price ranges.</p><p>What I see is that even Apple, a company with more than enough resources to do almost anything it imagines, couldn't break the grip Qualcomm has in North America.</p><p>We have no details about the process or licensing agreements (and probably never will) so we don't know exactly why Apple decided to forgo millimeter-wave 5G but I'm sure it's a decision that wasn't made lightly. Apple does not want its "budget" phone to be worse than a $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord</a> when it comes to network performance, but it will in places like New York or Chicago.</p>
<p>Apple says it has plans to expand the C1's usage to other models in its lineup. I'm betting it will find a way to integrate millimeter-wave technology before that happens.</p><p>What I know for sure is that Apple and Qualcomm have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/apple-infringed-three-qualcomm-patents-jury-finds-idUSKCN1QW2JZ/" target="_blank">long-standing love-hate relationship</a> and this almost certainly factored its way into the decision-making process. Qualcomm does have competitors like Samsung and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Exynos 5G modems</a> and there is more to a cellular modem than millimeter-wave support. There's also no denying that Qualcomm does it better. A lot better.</p><p>Qualcomm makes a great line of products, there is no denying that. It's just disheartening to see one company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-charges-qualcomm-monopolizing-key-semiconductor-device-used-cell-phones" target="_blank">have such a strong grip</a> that it can stifle competitors or charge exorbitant fees for patented IPs. If Intel couldn't do it, and Apple can't do it, can anyone?</p>

<ul><li>In an interview with Wareable, a OnePlus rep acknowledged that the one-size Watch 3 "remains heavy for a small wrist."</li><li>He promised that they will "fix" the lack of a small option this year, which could suggest a smaller OnePlus Watch 3R or Watch 4.</li><li>He also discussed the reason why the OnePlus Watch 3 only has an LTE version in China.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> has impressed us so far with its incredible battery life, we don't know how long it would last with a lighter, more comfortable case size. But based on statements from Dr. Leo Zhang, the Head of R&D at the OnePlus Health Lab, they're "working on" a smaller OnePlus Watch that should answer that question soon.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/news/oneplus-2025-smartwatch-smaller-case-size-lte-edition">PULSE by Wareable</a>, which interviewed Zhang, quotes him as saying, "It’s true that the [46mm OnePlus Watch 3] remains heavy for a small wrist and that this typically affects women, but we will fix that this year. We value our customer’s voice and we’re working on that."</p><p>As much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 3 improved on the Watch 2</a>, a smaller model was one of the few requested changes that OnePlus <em>didn't</em> deliver this year. The Watch 3 weighs about 50g without the strap or 80g with it; that's lighter than the 60g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but significantly heavier than the 34g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or 37g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> with comparable display sizes.</p><p>Given that OnePlus will "fix that" in 2025, we could theoretically see a smaller OnePlus Watch 3R this summer — a successor to the sporty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> — but the Watch 4 in 2026 seems more likely. Either way, we think plenty of people would lose a day or two of battery life and swap from a 1.5- to 1.3-inch display to make the OnePlus Watch 4 less distractingly hefty.</p>

<p>In this same interview, Wareable asked Zhang about the lack of an LTE option in North America and Europe.</p><p>"The technology isn’t a problem, that part is quite simple," Zhang explained. "In China’s domestic market, we have an LTE version. In an overseas market, we need to work with the carriers—and that’s a big hurdle. We need to work with carriers so users can put in an eSIM and have a data plan."</p><p>Zhang continued on to tell the site that they're also "working on" adding LTE by speaking with carriers, "especially in Europe."</p><p>Unlike his promise about a smaller OnePlus Watch, he didn't give a timetable for adding LTE, whether to the Watch 3, Watch 4, or a later model. And based on his words, it appears OnePlus's first priority will be to bring LTE to Europe before it focuses on the United States, where its wearable sales may be lower.</p><p>OnePlus has had a slightly messy Watch 3 launch week, given its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">"Meda in China" typo</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">disappointingly short update promise</a>. Despite this, we're highly encouraged to see OnePlus prioritizing a smaller watch design, in order to make its watches more competitive with the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>

<p>By now, you probably know that Google I/O 2025 — the company's annual developer conference — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">is happening May 20 and May 21, 2025 at Shoreline Amphitheatre</a> in Mountain View, California. The company announced as much last week, by way of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-help-reveal-google-i-o-2025s-date-with-prism-shift-puzzle-game">a fun puzzle game with lasers, prisms, and mirrors</a>. But you might not know that Google used the Gemini API and the Google AI Studio to make the "Save the date" puzzle for the first time this year.</p><p>Google created secret levels for the puzzle game this year for the most passionate completionists out there. When a puzzle is loading, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini API</a> adds a secret tile on the game's board and presents a clever riddle to help players find it. You'll need to solve these Gemini-created riddles to unlock the bonus levels. Google says this kind of thing is something it could've manually coded, but the Gemini API and Google AI Studio helped it save time.</p><p>"Google AI Studio helped us integrate the feature faster in a unique, creative way," said Jay Chang, a senior product marketing manager at Google, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2025-puzzle-ai/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "We programmatically generated the prompts for Gemini 1.5 Flash, using code, and then let it get creative in how it crafted the riddles."</p><p>It's a unique preview of what can be done with the Gemini API and Google AI Studio to save app developers time while creating new experiences. It's also very fitting for the Google I/O 2025, since the event's main focus is to help developers learn and try the new APIs and AI features Google introduces each year. That's what I/O is all about — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everyone-is-talking-about-google-i-o-but-what-exactly-is-it-and-who-is-it-for">it's not really for the average Android user</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a bit of deeper meaning behind Google's choice of lasers and mirrors, beyond looking like the "I" and "O" in Google I/O.</p><p>“Prisms and mirrors are integral tools in quantum computing, used to manipulate and analyze light and quantum states," explained Kacey Fahey, a Google senior product marketing manager. "This year's puzzle design was inspired by these concepts, challenging players to use reflections and refractions to solve complex puzzles."</p><p>You can still replay the Google I/O 2025 puzzle game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/puzzle" target="_blank">here</a>, as you wait for the developer conference to start in late May.

<hr>
<p>For the first time, Major League Baseball players in Spring Training will be able to challenge a ball or strike call on a thrown pitch using an automatic ball-strike (ABS) system. It won't impact the 2025 regular season — the ABS system is currently in the testing stage at Spring Training for about 60% of games — but it is a big deal for the sport. As it turns out, the ABS system is powered by a private <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile 5G network</a>, as the carrier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/t-mobile-and-mlb-bring-5g-powered-automated-ball-strike-system?norewrite=UUapUeUpU1025421" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 21.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> is the official wireless parter of MLB, and thus it's using a private network under its Advanced Network Solution (ANS) umbrella to provide a 5G connection for the ABS system. Hawk-Eye cameras set up by MLB are positioned around Spring Training stadiums to "triangulate" the strike zone, T-Mobile says. From there, the private ANS network from T-Mobile transmits data to and from parts of the ABS system over 5G.</p><p>Corporate use cases like this one are part of the reason 5G exists. The technology can elicit fast, secure connections between wireless devices. Recently, T-Mobile announced plans to use another private ANS system to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-5g-miller-electric-partnership-autonomous-vehicles">power a self-driving car project in Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Now, a similar 5G network will facilitate the ABS system at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida, starting today.</p><p>For T-Mobile customers and baseball fans, the more exciting announcement might be that MLB.tv is free for the 10th straight season. Subscribers of T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Home Internet and Small Business plans will be able to redeem season-long MLB.tv access in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-old-t-mobile-app-is-officially-gone-for-good-time-to-download-t-life">T-Life app</a>. Keep your eye out, because a MLB.tv plan typically costs $150 and you can only claim it between March 25 and March 31.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hSPCfN9yKubtVzuTDG6jiL" name="T-Mobile-MLBTV" alt="T-Mobile is working with MLB for the ABS system and MLB.tv" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hSPCfN9yKubtVzuTDG6jiL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the MLB.tv subscription doesn't offer most in-market games due to blackouts. You'll still need cable for that, but MLB.tv will work with all out-of-market games during the 2025 season. Considering it's free with your T-Mobile cellular or internet plan, there's no downside to claiming it. And one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPN apps for Android</a> might just solve that blackout problem.</p><p>According to T-Mobile, MLB.tv access is one of the most popular free perks offered by the carrier. It says T-Mobile customers streamed 58 million hours of live baseball during the 2024 season, which is a record.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Meet has swapped some of its in-app controls in an attempt to "organize features more intuitively."</li><li>Emoji reactions will now be visible in the bottom bar, while the hand raise option takes a back seat in the three-dot menu.</li><li>These changes will reflect on both Android and iOS devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems like it is focused on creating a more seamless experience for its users on Meet. In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-call-control-updates.html">Workspace update post</a>, Google said it is rearranging some of its in-app controls on Meet so that its most used features are easily accessible, "this will help you to navigate the Meet layout faster and more intuitively," the post added.</p><p>To start, Emoji reactions that were once hidden in the three-dot menu will now take position front and center, within the bottom bar on the Meet call screen. This will help users quickly react to conversations, by Simply tapping the Emoji toggle to access or hide the reaction picker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="73RBn7aLF5MfVgzYVd3QeH" name="Google-Meet-Emoji-Reacts" alt="Gif showing Emoji Reacts on Google Meet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/73RBn7aLF5MfVgzYVd3QeH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="288" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Secondly, the 'hand raise' feature has now been moved to the triple-dot menu, from Meet's bottom access bar, swapping it with the emoji reactions. It's unclear why Google would choose to hide the hand raise option since most people tend to use it on work calls.</p><p>Seems like the company was focusing on the personal meet conversations while making this change. It is important to note that these changes will only reflect on mobile devices, if you’re using a larger screen device, such as a tablet, the 'Hand Raise' icon will remain in the bottom bar or the main call menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="bZ6KZSGY7p8Boinx2zzVsi" name="Google-Meet-Handraise" alt="Hand Raise on Google Meet moved" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZ6KZSGY7p8Boinx2zzVsi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="288" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, Google is cleaning things up with the overflow menu on the app so that it looks a little less cluttered. With the redesign, the 'Host management controls' will now be moved deep within the settings menu, under the “General” section. The option to 'report a problem' will also be seated in the Settings menu, giving the main call menu a less cluttered look.</p><p>These changes have already started showing up on Android devices, as of Feb.20, and will be seen on iOS devices starting Feb.24. For Android phones, the minimum build required to see these updates is:</p><p><strong>Meet: 291.0.722438190.duo.android_20250202.14</strong></p><p><strong>Gmail: 2025.02.02.722438226</strong></p><p>Lastly, Google switched the end call button to the bottom right instead of the left side, only for iOS users. Along with these redesign changes, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-call-control-updates.html" target="_blank">recently announced </a>that the transcripts for Live Captions and Translate on Meet that only remained on the screen briefly will now be available for 30 minutes.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's delays bringing One UI 7 to older devices have been well-chronicled, and that continues as the company seeded its fifth beta update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series today, Feb. 21. The minor update is appearing for U.S. users on AT&T and Verizon to start, and is available as an OTA update for users in the One UI 7 Beta program, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-one-ui-7-beta-5-update-usa/">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>This update comes just days after the fourth One UI 7 beta, and carries a version number of <strong>S92xU1UEU4ZYBB</strong>. It's available for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra if the device is enrolled in the beta program already. It's relatively small, with an update size of roughly 450MB, according to SamMobile. The exact size of the update may depend on your device and carrier. The patch might arrive in other regions and networks in the future.</p><p>To see if your Galaxy S24 is eligible for the update, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigate to <strong>Software update </strong>> <strong>Download and install</strong>.</p>

<p>The latest One UI 7 beta update comes a few weeks after Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">acknowledged that the operating system's release for older phones would be delayed</a>. In a community post Feb. 6, the company said it planned to release a fourth beta update fixing a bug that "causes the display color temperature to appear more yellow than intended." Of course, if you're keeping track at home, the update released today is the <em>fifth</em> One UI 7 beta update for Galaxy S24 owners in the U.S.</p><p>According to the patch's release notes, this update includes a fix for a Visual Voicemail crash problem reported by testers.</p><p>It's unclear when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> will reach stability for the Galaxy S24 lineup and other Galaxy phones. Shortly after the Galaxy S25 debuted, Samsung pledged to bring it to older devices "imminently" and that users should expect it sometime in Q1 2025. We don't know if that timetable has been pushed back due to the latest round of delays.</p>

<hr>
<p>Reports are springing up from Fitbit's past-gen smartwatch owners about a severe battery life issue following a recent emergency update.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616719/fitbit-versa-3-sense-overheating-battery-wearables">The Verge</a>, users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/td-p/5718530">Fitbit forums</a> have started voicing their displeasure regarding a drastic drop in smartwatch battery life. The thread's original poster (OP) states that following Google's mandatory patch for the Versa 3,  version 36.128.6.21, their device lasts "less than a day." While this is coming off a full charge, the OP explains they turned "everything off" on the device, too.</p><p>This means their Versa 3's notifications, snore detection, vibrations, and more were all disabled to try and squeeze as much battery life out of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the patch is causing the watch's battery to drop and (the wrong) record speeds. The user adds it's made their watch virtually "useless" as they're unable to accurately capture sleep data or go for a run.</p><p>Several other users chimed in, stating their Versa 3 is experiencing the same downward trend following Google's mandatory patch. One user claims they had to charge their watch "twice in one day" as it can't make it without doing so.</p><p>Similar to the OP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/m-p/5722672/highlight/true#M321458">one user said</a> their Versa 3 would last roughly five to six days without needing another charge. Following the patch, they're experiencing disconnects, a lack of notifications, and more frequent required charges.</p><p>The publication spotted reports about the Fitbit Sense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1ip7m4u/fitbit_sense_battery_suddenly_very_poor_dies_in/">on Reddit</a>, too.</p>

<p>It's not like the sudden battery changes are coming from left field as, in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">Google sent a warning</a> to all Sense and Versa 3 owners about severe overheating issues. Both devices were getting far too hot to the point that they could cause physical harm to the user wearing them. The company informed users that it was working on a patch to "reduce the risk" of the issue.</p><p>More importantly, Google stated in its announcement, "the battery will last for shorter periods between charges."</p><p>Granted, the company was never clear as to how short "shorter" means for either device. Versa 3 owners are reportedly struggling to even go a full day on a single charge after reaching a maximum of six. Fitbit Moderators on the forum have reiterated the same statement made by Google in January, as well.</p><p>Further, one moderator <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/m-p/5726359/highlight/true#M321580">recently instructed a user</a> to Google's Sense and Versa 3 compensation page due to their battery life issues. Like the company's original warning, it told users to provide information, and if their device qualifies, they would deliver $50 in compensation for the issues. If your device's battery life draining severely, perhaps you could do the same.</p><p>Fitbit has a long history of overheating devices, beginning with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-is-recalling-over-1-million-ionic-smartwatches-heres-why">its old Ionic smartwatches</a> from 2022. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-hit-with-another-lawsuit">second lawsuit</a> came in 2022, as well, a couple of months after the first as users were getting burned by overheating devices.</p>

<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great news!!Galaxy Z Flip FE (SM-F761B): The first One UI test build has been spotted on the server for various regions.Build Version: F761BXXU0AYB1/F761BOXM0AYB1/F761BXXU0AYB1It has been found in India, Europe, the UAE, and other Asian regions. pic.twitter.com/CfwGjqwgn7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1892872602433052840">February 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The supposed Galaxy Z Flip FE is bearing the SM-F761B model number. The model number corroborates with an earlier spotting of the same device bearing F761BXXU0AYB1 firmware from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-indirectly-confirms-cheaper-galaxy-z-flip/">last week</a>.</p><p>Aside from the model number and the new firmware, very little is known about the Galaxy Z Flip FE. Early rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025">have indicated</a> that the clamshell phone is likely to debut alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 foldables later this year.</p>
<p>The expected specifications of the handset comprise a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with Full HD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Additionally, the display, that is likely to be utilized, is the Ultra-Thin-Glass (UTG). One UI 7.0 is expected, which is Android 15-based. The device is also tipped to use an Exynos chip, possibly an Exynos 2400, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-s24-internal-chip-rumors">previous leak</a>.</p><p>The Fan Edition flip phone is also expected to have a 50MP primary camera and support for 25W fast charging, although there is no word about the battery capacity yet.</p>
<p>From all the Galaxy foldables that Samsung makes every year the Flip series is significantly cheaper than the book-style phones, and the company choosing a clamshell phone as an affordable option, comes as no surprise.</p><p>With the model numbers and firmware popping up, we could see more of the Galaxy Z Flip FE in the coming months.</p>

The elegant design choices and outstanding camera specs are all still there, but now you get an upgraded chipset, the latest AI software features, and two sizes to choose from. The haptics remain some of the best on the market, and the seven-year software promise means that the phone will continue to feel cutting-edge for many years to come. </p><p>That being said, dropping $800 at Best Buy may be a tall order for some folks, so check with your wireless carrier to see what Google Pixel 9 deals they have before you commit. Verizon, for instance, will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-9-pro/"><strong>give you the phone for free</strong></a> when you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan, while the T-Mobile-owned carrier Mint Mobile will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/6810506/"><strong>$400 off the XL version of the phone</strong></a>, plus some heavily discounted wireless when you pay for a year in advance.

<hr>
<p>Rabbit has announced that it is introducing a cross-platform general agent system to enable smart, autonomous agents that will supposedly act on users’ behalf on devices. And, the company has demoed the first iteration with a video and an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rabbit.tech/research/first-look-at-rabbits-Android-agent">blog post</a>.</p><p>Dubbed the Android agent that "uses apps and controls devices," the company notes that it is an expansion to the LAM playground web agent, which it announced back in October 2024 — with navigation limited to a web browser.</p><p>The showcased video by Rabbit engineers includes them typing their requests in a prompt box of the said Android agent — and on a laptop. The given prompts are then performed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Kg8G41ZvHU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The prompts here include some single actions on a system level on the tablet alongside some multi-step actions, which the company touts the new agent is capable of. For system settings, the engineers in the video demonstrated the agent capable of changing app notifications.</p><p>For multi-step actions, the demo has included the ability to send an AI-generated poem to a contact on WhatsApp. Similarly, other prompts comprised searching for a video on the YouTube app and playing the video. Additionally, other prompts given to the agent include adding ingredients from an app to the groceries list in the Google Keep app.</p>
<p>Other notable multi-step prompts generating "a revenue plan in Google Docs from a business idea in Google Keep and share it with contacts,” and the ability to download a game from Google Play and also play it.</p><p>While all these are quite significant actions that were performed on an Android tablet with prompts to the Android agent, they appear a bit slower than what consumers are normally used to.</p>
<p>Rabbit addresses the very same thing noting that “there are a lot of optimizations to be made on speed, intelligence, and how quickly it recognizes the states.” The Android agent is assured to make progress in the coming weeks and the company notes that improvements can then be witnessed in terms of speeds, accuracy, and intelligence.</p><p>Rabbit also notes that it will share some interesting updates about the upcoming cross-platform multi-agent system in the coming weeks, and the latest Android agent is just a part of it.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit's recent app version holds signs about a potential Labs test called "Sleep need Labs."</li><li>This test will see the app deliver periodic surveys to testers throughout the day to gauge their energy levels and wake up time.</li><li>Once sufficient data is gathered, the Sleep Labs test will offer a suggested bedtime to users to ensure they can last through the day.</li><li>Fitbit Labs held its first test in October, which saw the introduction of Insight Explorer backed by Gemini.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit is reportedly preparing to introduce a new experiment within its in-app Labs test environment.</p><p>An APK dive of version 4.37 of the Fitbit app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/fitbit-sleep-need-lab/">9to5Google</a> supposedly produced signs about an upcoming "Sleep need Labs" test. At its core, the feature seems to need to know information about you and your sleep, such as when you wake up and when you typically go to bed. Within the code, the test will inform users of the following: "Each day, answer a few questions about how you feel at different times."</p><p>Supposedly, the "different times" refers to a survey given to testers during the morning, afternoon, and evening. However, Fitbit's early code suggests the app will question users about their energy levels during the afternoon survey. Another key point reads, "Fitbit uses your responses, and your sleep data, to work out the sleep you need each night."</p><p>What the code doesn't explain is how long these surveys will need to occur before the app understands the user and their daily life.</p><p>Once this is completed, the publication's findings show the app will provide "a personalized bedtime and wake time recommendation." The app will then "recommend" an appropriate alarm time for you to set on your device once it fully understands your day's energy levels and more.</p>

<p>It's not clear when Fitbit could roll out this "Sleep need Labs" test to users. Considering its barebones code strings, we might have to wait a while longer.</p><p>Fitbit launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Labs experimental grounds</a> in October 2024, which included its first test, Insight Explorer. The test was available for Premium users, giving them access to a Gemini-driven test that let the app "understand" the user better. Insight Explorer would gather a user's health data through a series of questions so the AI could deliver "personalized answers."</p><p>These answers were based on the data the app has cataloged on you, like your steps, Active Zone Minutes, sleep score, sleep duration, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and more.</p><p>Fitbit Labs was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-powered-fitbit-labs-coming-later-this-year-for-some-fitbit-premium-subscribers">first teased</a> during the Google Health event last March. Perhaps Fitbit is looking to line things up with the next Health event. Looks like we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<ul><li>A demo video of Google's upcoming "Live Updates" notifications for Android 16 showcases its early design elements and capabilities.</li><li>For food orders, Live Updates will constantly update its small UI chip with brief updates on its status while the notification panel houses its larger progress bar.</li><li>Google highlighted Live Updates during Beta 1, stating it is encouraging developers to utilize it for ride-sharing, food, and navigation.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Android 16's development progresses, testers have surfaced a glimpse of a Samsung-like feature for the next OS.</p><p>Leveraging a demo app created by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medium.com/@vitoksmile/android-16-and-progress-centric-notifications-705cbd14db40">separate developer</a>, Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-live-updates-demo-3528456/">Android Authority</a>) worked some code magic to get Android 16's upcoming "Live Updates" working. After tricking the software into thinking an "order was placed," Rahman was able to capture how Live Updates for food orders could appear once the OS arrives.</p><p>Firstly, the demo shows there will be a small chip to be present at the top left of your display, beside the clock. The chip will be brief, delivering a one-word progress update, such as "placed" (regarding your order). As your order progresses, the chip will change from "placed" to "accepted." As the test continues, the update switches to "cooking" before "cooked," marking its completion in the restaurant.</p><p>After, the order's status changes from "arriving" to "delivered."</p><p>Most of these updates — for food, anyway — are reminiscent of checking your order's status through DoorDash, for example. However, Rahman explains that users can tap the chip at the top left to produce a small pop-up notification. The pop-up is short but expands on what the different status updates mean.</p><p>At the moment, users can swipe down to open the notification panel to view their order's current status, as well as a progress bar. Rahman states Live Updates are available on the lock screen and "are the only notifications that aren’t collapsed" into the software's shelf. Google was also spotted working on a toggle for apps that may support Live Updates, so users can decide which they'd like to appear.</p>

<p>Google kicked off its wider, Pixel-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1</a> a couple of months after developers got their first preview. While the beta signaled the acceptance period for early adopters, Google highlighted new features, like Live Updates. Marked as a major introduction, the company states its Live Updates were designed for "more urgent notification cases."</p><p>In Beta 1, Google encouraged app developers to utilize Live Updates for ride-sharing info, food orders, and navigation. With how Live Updates operates, the feature reminds us of the lock screen-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Bar</a> on the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Earlier this month, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">Beta 2</a> to enrolled Pixel testers. The second build packed a little more than the first as the company provided huge camera and media updates. Android 16 Beta 2 includes support for fine color temperature and tint adjustments. Additionally, Google lets users fully control the ISO and exposure time when taking photos.</p><p>According to Google's rapid timeline, Beta 2 was right on time in February as the company is eyeing a Q2 2025 release for Android 16.</p>

<p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">best Samsung laptops</a> on the market today, 2024&apos;s Galaxy Book 4 Pro is powered by the excellent Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and utilizes a secondary NPU (neural processing unit) chip to perform AI tasks. The device itself also boasts a ton of ports on both sides of the laptop, including an HDMI, two USB-C, and even a USB-A port. You&apos;d expect that these additions, along with the powerful Dolby Atmos speakers, would create a bulky, heavy laptop, but the Galaxy Book 4 Pro somehow clocks in at just 3.4 pounds for the 16-inch version, making it perfect for tossing into a backpack or briefcase. </p><p>The record-breaking discount on the Book 4 Pro comes just a month after the reveal of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">Galaxy Book 5</a> series of laptops, a super-premium (and super-powerful) lineup of devices that boast the latest Intel processors, touchscreen displays, and more. The problem is that these new laptops are quite expensive, so we still recommend the Galaxy Book 4 Pro if you want great value <em>and</em> impressive specs. </p>

<ul><li>Phone 3a and 3a Pro leaked renders reveal a translucent design, glyph interfaces, and a dedicated camera button. The 3a Pro has a periscopic lens.</li><li>They look slightly wider over the predecessor models in the renders, and are tipped to share same 6.77-inch screens.</li><li>Both are expected to be powered by Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 underneath, indicating Nothing’s shifts from MediaTek.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has left practically nothing to the imagination as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-says-there-was-no-intent-to-mislead-in-phone-3a-camera-comparison">teased various </a>capabilities of its new phone, which is set to launch at MWC next month. The only thing missing was the renders of the phone and now they appear to have been leaked.</p><p>The alleged renders of what seems to be marketing material from Nothing were shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/02/exclusive-nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-complete-official-renders-leak.html">Android Headlines</a>, giving us more than just a hint as to what the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">mid-range phones</a> from the company will look like. At first glance, per the renders, the device appears quite identical to the previous model from the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:492px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.95%;"><img id="NPH8HaG57wPVWLSZXTBnqc" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-render-02" alt="Nothing Phone 3a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPH8HaG57wPVWLSZXTBnqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="492" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the back, however, while there seem to be share similarities, including Nothing’s signature translucent design and a couple of glyph interfaces, the camera visor looks more prominent than the previous iteration. It could be because there are a couple of additional sensors coming to both Phone 3a and 3a Pro models.</p><p>Just like the previous model, this one too looks like it will have three cameras but one is believed to be a periscopic lens, as Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">recently confirmed</a>. Another interesting element to look forward to is the addition of an extra button right on both handsets — likely to be a dedicated camera button that can instantly trigger the camera similar to what we have seen on Apple’s recent iPhone 16 series. On the whole, per the renders, both handsets appear wider than the previous models while retaining flat sides.</p>

<p>The Phone 3a and the 3a Pro will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">released globally</a> on March 4, and the company has already confirmed that they will use a Snapdragon chipset which is tipped to be the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. The publication further notes that the Phone 3a should feature either 8/12GB of RAM and 128/256GB of onboard storage. The Pro model, however, should settle for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of built-in storage.</p><p>However, both models are expected to have the same three sensors at the back: a 50MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 50MP telephoto lens. The latter on the Pro has an advantage: it is a periscopic lens offering digital zoom up to 60x. As for selfies, the Phone 3a is tipped to have a 32MP shooter, and the Pro should feature another 50MP lens.</p>

<p>Other shared highlights of both handsets include a 6.77-inch 120Hz display, a 5000mAh battery capacity, and Android 15-powered Nothing OS. The information, that we currently have up until now, ensures that these are some promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">sub-$400 Android phones</a> that are incoming, which aren’t just specifications-rich but also share some cool design aesthetics than the competition.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, people are still upset about Samsung removing the BLE functionality from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen. Perhaps it's just a "vocal minority" kind of thing, but the discourse left us wondering what Samsung should do for the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>There are really four different paths that Samsung could take; keep things as they are now, bring back BLE, ditch the S Pen while retaining compatibility, or just get rid of the S Pen entirely. Each of these comes with its own sets of pros and cons, so let's take a deeper look.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-change-anything-2">Don't Change Anything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2t5Wknyoth2Aw2meBRbwnj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-s-pen-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the S Pen slightly unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2t5Wknyoth2Aw2meBRbwnj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For me, the most obvious course of action is for Samsung to just keep things the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. The community has voiced its opinion, but Samsung has the numbers to back up its decision.</p><p>In doing so, this would probably mean that we would have another year without built-in Qi2 charging or support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">magnetic accessories</a>. To some, like myself, it's definitely going to be annoying, but as I've already found with the S25 Ultra, accessory makers offer a workaround.</p>

<p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">iFixit revealed</a> that the new S Pen features <em>almost</em> the same internals as the previous version, I couldn't help but laugh. Not because it was surprising but because all Samsung did was use a blank circuit board.</p><p>My first thought was that Samsung probably just slapped the circuit boards in there as part of the structural integrity or something. However, the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra S Pens aren't exactly identical, leading me to believe that there's a chance Samsung initially planned on including BLE before scrapping it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A2zghntLi3KtPpemArgKtE" name="Ultra25_49-2048x1152" alt="Comparison of the S Pen with and without Bluetooth." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A2zghntLi3KtPpemArgKtE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108201/galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-quick-battery-fix-slow-progress-on-repairability" target="_blank">IFIXIT</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that these phones are likely designed at least a year or two in advance, the circuit boards were already developed and printed but weren't assembled. So when Samsung ran the numbers and found that <em>practically</em> nobody uses Air Actions, it decided against having the capacitors and other bits and bobs added to the board.</p><p>That being said, I think this is the second least likely decision Samsung would make with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>. I just can't see a company backtracking just to appease less than 1% of its customer base.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-galaxy-z-fold-approach-2">Take the Galaxy Z Fold Approach</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL" name="samsung-s-pen-pro-galaxy-s25-ultra-z-fold-6" alt="S Pen Pro on Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wouldn't be an editorial from me without mentioning foldables at least once, so here we are. Samsung first brought along S Pen support with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>, and every model since has retained that support. However, Samsung foldable phones are compatible with a different type of S Pen, named the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Fold Edition</a>.</p><p>For one, it's not built-in, nor will you find one in the box. Instead, it's a separate purchase, either on its own or included with Samsung's S Pen Case. In terms of functionality, the S Pen Fold Edition and the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen are pretty much the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dKHPqMa5bRH6ddv2P5Z9NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-s-pen-slim-comparison-03.jpg" alt="The new slimmer S Pen for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKHPqMa5bRH6ddv2P5Z9NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn't offer a S Pen Fold Edition with Bluetooth built-in, meaning that Z Fold users are already used to not having Air Actions. However, the Z Fold technically does support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">Air Actions</a>, provided that you have the now-discontinued S Pen Pro. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't offer any kind of support for Bluetooth-enabled S Pens, so you're out of luck on that front.</p><p>If the Galaxy S26 Ultra were to take this route, it could open the door for more improvements. By ditching the built-in S Pen, that should mean Samsung can fill that space with a bigger battery, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">maybe even a microSD card slot</a>. It also likely would mean proper built-in Qi2 wireless charging, hopefully, complete with support for MagSafe accessories without needing a case.</p>

<p>Surely Samsung wouldn't take away one of the defining reasons to pick an Ultra over any other flagship phone? Right? Well, that's the only other potential option that I could think of. But it's also more unlikely that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> will get the same camera hardware as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>There are still plenty of people who use an S Pen, so I just can't see a scenario where Samsung just drops it altogether. I'm also aware that companies have a knack for just getting rid of things for the sake of it, but this wouldn't make much sense. Well, that's unless Samsung was actively trying to push people into the arms of Apple, Google, and OnePlus.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sjadVmhSFTZWyniwhrgiCD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-back-02" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge's protruding camera module at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sjadVmhSFTZWyniwhrgiCD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I were a betting man (and I am), I think the Galaxy S26 Ultra will look and function almost identically to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Complete with the included S Pen. I think Samsung is proud of the design changes that it made with its latest flagship, and seeing how much pushback there was with the removal of BLE on the S Pen, I shudder to think about what would happen if the S Pen was no longer included.</p><p>For the sake of brevity, here's where I rank the laid-out scenarios:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Don't Change Anything</li><li>Take the Galaxy Z Fold Approach</li><li>Saying Goodbye?</li><li>Bring Back BLE</li></ol>
<p>If you think I'm crazy, don't forget about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> that's slated to be released at some point this year. That gives Samsung an option for those who want a big-screen phone but without the bulk of needing to have a place for the S Pen. This means that the Edge can live alongside the Ultra while giving Samsung the flexibility to offer a variety of phones based on what <em>you</em> want.</p>

<ul><li>Google is done selling the Chromecast with Google TV on the Google Store.</li><li>The Chromecast with Google TV HD and Chromecast with Google TV 4K are both listed as "no longer available."</li><li>Google planned to let stock of Chromecasts run out for good after announcing the Google TV Streamer last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast with Google TV</a>, it's time to hunt one down: both the Chromecast with Google TV HD and its 4K counterpart are no longer available for purchase on the Google Store. The $50 and $30 Chromecast with Google TV streaming dongles are being discontinued in favor of the new Google TV Streamer, as the company announced last year. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/google-store-chromecast-with-google-tv/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_google_tv" target="_blank">Chromecast with Google TV product page</a> on the Google Store says both models are "no longer available" as of Thursday, Feb. 20.</p><p>Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/why-the-google-tv-streamer-is-more-important-than-you-think">Google TV Streamer</a> back in August 2024, and it's a $100 set-top box with Google TV and more features — effectively replacing the Chromecast. At the time, Google said it would still provide support and updates to the Chromecast with Google TV. However, it would only continue to sell the streaming dongle until current stock was exhausted.</p><p>It seems as if Google is officially done selling the Chromecast with Google TV, at least through direct channels. It looks like you can still find Chromecast with Google TV HD and Chromecast with Google TV 4K at some third-party retailers, like Walmart, but who knows for how long. Soon, Google will have finished selling Chromecasts for good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.53%;"><img id="mUhME8bq8gpPWsbi3GgfQ3" name="Chromecast-With-Google-TV-Google-Store" alt="A screenshot of the Chromecast with Google TV product page." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUhME8bq8gpPWsbi3GgfQ3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2110" height="1446" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device replacing the Chromecast with Google TV, the Google TV Streamer, is a bit controversial. At $100, it's significantly more expensive than the Chromecast with Google TV — priced at $30 (HD) or $50 (4K) — which was appealing to budget buyers.</p><p>That's because most smart TVs nowadays match the functionality of a budget streaming stick, per the company. However, the Google TV Streamer also isn't quite as powerful as other set-top boxes, like the old Nvidia Shield. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">We reviewed the device</a> positively overall, but noted it still fell short in a few key areas.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer runs Android 14 for TV, an update that existing Chromecast with Google TV devices haven't received yet. While your Chromecast with Google TV will still get future updates, there won't be any new ones to buy now that Google has officially shuttered the brand.</p>

I use it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-from-anywhere">connect to my NAS remotely</a>, and it just makes it so much more convenient. Basically, Tailscale is a tunneling service that creates a secure connection to your devices, making remote access a breeze.</p>

<p>Another big use case is ad blocking. I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-ads-pi-hole-raspberry-pi">Pi-hole set up</a> on a Pi 4 that's connected to my home network, and it does a great job blocking ads on all devices — including phones and tablets — while I'm in the house. As a high-level overview, Pi-hole is an incredible utility that blocks ads on the entire home network; you set it up on a device like the Pi 4 or Pi 5 and connect it to your router, and have it running as the DNS server. It has built-in ad lists and does a great job filtering ads on all devices that connect to your router (including IoT gear), and it's an invaluable tool. <br><br>But that's just in the confines of my home; it's not like I can configure a Pi-hole on the go. The solution is to use Tailscale to connect to my home network, allowing me to essentially use Pi-hole as the DNS while traveling. The best part about this is how easy it was to set up; why I like Tailscale so much is the seamlessness with which it works — there's no need to manually configure settings in any way; just have the service installed on any device you want to connect to, and you're good to go. Oh, and did I mention that it doesn't cost anything to use? <br><br>Tailscale is a zero trust networking service, which means it doesn't store any user data. In fact, it doesn't even handle authentication; you'll need to use your Google account or any other SSO while setting up and logging into the utility.</p>

<p>I've had a busy week with launch events in Malaysia and Singapore, and I did most of my work on a Windows machine and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>. Both devices connected to my Tailnet — my home Tailscale network — and as the DNS was being filtered by Pi-hole, I didn't see any ads. I was initially worried that it would lead to increased latency as all data was being routed to my home network 2,000 miles away, but it wasn't a problem at all — there was no noticeable difference while browsing, and it felt like I was back home. <br><br>This usability is what makes Tailscale so good. I also like that it doubles as a tunnel to all my other devices; I needed to download images of the Find N5 saved in my home NAS, and I did so while I was at the product launch event. I just connected to my NAS via Tailscale, browsed to the folder, and downloaded the images onto my Find N5. I use a decent number of networking tools, but Tailscale continues to be the best around, and its robust feature-set combined with effortless ease of use (and the fact that it's free) makes it an easy recommendation.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-117">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After a 4.5-month beta, Strava's Athlete Intelligence is launching as a stable version with increased accuracy and new insights.</li><li>Strava is also improving its algorithm to prevent cheating or miscategorized activities on its segment leaderboards.</li><li>Other Strava updates include a new progress summary chart and a way to share your post-activity Flyover views to Instagram stories.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strava's Athlete Intelligence, which launched in beta last October, has achieved its first stable build this week. And it's just one of several key changes coming to the Strava app.</p><p>Strava's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-enhances-subscriber-experience-with-updates-to-key-features">press release</a> explains how Athlete Intelligence delivers "even more insights for a more tailored analysis of each upload" with the latest version. For instance, it can interpret "non-GPS activities" like treadmill runs or cycling power meter data for the first time.</p><p>More generally, if you frequently run the same route, Athlete Intelligence will "note how your pace or speed compared to other times on that route," as well as call out any record distances or gold segments. And Strava is promising "more accurate insights with fewer mistakes" than Athlete Intelligence showed during beta.</p><p>In our testing, we initially noticed obvious mistakes, like Athlete Intelligence claiming that a 150bpm-average run was an anaerobic activity, but the insights have gotten more useful (and accurate) in recent weeks. Strava claims that 80+% of polled Strava subscribers "say that Athlete Intelligence is very helpful," which is why they decided to take it out of beta.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strava also intends to improve its leaderboard algorithm to improve overall integrity. For instance, they're analyzing results to "prevent bike rides on run leaderboards and ebikes on ride leaderboards." Both accidental miscategorizations and intentional cheating are targeted.</p><p>"Every activity uploaded to Strava is now automatically analyzed by our machine learning model, which looks at 57 different factors, like speed and acceleration, to determine if any portion of an activity was recorded in a vehicle," Strava explains.</p><p>On the lighter side of things, Strava will now let you share your post-run GPS Flyover summaries to Instagram Stories (or other platforms) for the first time. You can impress your friends with an eagle-eyed view of your epic rides, runs, and hikes, simply by clicking the Share button on the Activity Details Page; Instagram Stories will be a default option, but you can copy the Flyover link for other apps.</p><p>Finally, this February Strava update has revamped the Progress Summary Chart. In the You tab and Progress section, you can select a specific sport and time frame: one week, one month, three months, six months, year-to-date, or one year.</p><p>You'll then see your cumulative distance, time, elevation, or activity count in that frame, and you can tap "Compare Date Range" to see how, for example, your 2024 stats compare to your 2023 stats.</p><p>Strava has made significant updates to its app in recent months, from Apple Fitness+ integration to Night Heatmaps to help you decide where it's safe to run in the evening. But this new version of Athlete Intelligence, combined with Strava's compatibility with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a>, should only make Strava's subscription even more popular with athletes.</p>

<hr>
<p>In typical Gemini fashion, Google is bringing a feature once exclusive to paid Gemini Advanced subscribers to all free users, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1892678157406281931" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 20 in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Free users can now upload documents for analysis on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app on iOS and Android, plus the Gemini web client.</p><p>"Document upload is now available to all Gemini users," the company wrote. "Upload multiple Google Docs, PDFs, and Word documents from Google Drive or your device. Get quick summaries, personalized feedback, and actionable insights — streamlining your workflows and saving you time."</p><p>To use the feature in the Gemini app, write a prompt in the text field and tap the "plus" icon to add a file using the <strong>Files</strong> or <strong>Drive</strong> buttons. As the company explains above, Gemini can intake files stored physically on your device or in the cloud via Google Drive. It can also handle multiple files within its context window. Then, it'll be able to analyze the files provided and use it to respond to your query in the proper context.</p>

<p>As always, Google reminds users that you'll need to check Gemini responses for accuracy. Additionally, keep in mind that you shouldn't share any private information with Gemini.</p><p>There are still reasons to use Gemini Advanced for file analysis. Certain file types are still unsupported in the free version of Gemini, such as code documents or spreadsheets. It's also unclear how much information the free version of Gemini can intake before limits are reached. By comparison, Gemini can handle up to one million tokens for users with a paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Premium subscription</a> — which costs $20 per month and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-ai-premium-plan-just-got-more-appealing-with-new-perks">unlocks Gemini Advanced</a>.</p><p>Still, this continues Google's trend of slowly making paid features available to free users after a waiting period. It's one of the perks of using Gemini compared to other chatbots.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing claims it mistakenly compared video from the iPhone 16 Pro Max's ultrawide camera to the Nothing Phone 3a's main camera.</li><li>The company shared a statement in a pinned YouTube comment after viewers pointed out the potentially-misleading comparison.</li><li>It said there was "no intent to mislead" in the YouTube comparison.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is trickling information out about the upcoming Nothing Phone 3a series before its release, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">shared the official camera specs for the devices</a> earlier this week. Alongside the specifications, Nothing released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D_btmdrP9M" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> comparing the Phone 3a's camera performance to the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max. In the video, the company compared a video clip from the iPhone's lower-quality ultrawide camera to video from the Nothing Phone 3a's main rear camera.</p><p>YouTube commenters pointed out that the clip comparison was misleading, as the iPhone 16 Pro Max's ultrawide camera is significantly worse than its main sensor for video. In response, Nothing said this comparison was made as a result of an editing mistake and wasn't intentional. It shared the following statement in a pinned YouTube comment and on the Nothing community Discord:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilisation comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!</p><figcaption><cite>Nothing</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>It appears the original, unedited YouTube video with the potentially-misleading clip is still live at the time of publishing. While the pinned comment is there, the video includes little sign that there is a mistake if viewers don't manually navigate to the comments. The video's description doesn't include any mention of the error, either.</p><p>You can watch the original video below, and Nothing shared the full-resolution images and videos via Google Drive in the video's description. That's how savvy viewers were able to originally spot that the iPhone 16 Pro Max video sample was using an unequal camera sensor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/nothing-phone-3a-iphone-camera-comparison-trick/#more-662130" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p>

<p>It's likely that, as Nothing claims, the comparison between the iPhone's secondary camera and the Phone 3a's main camera was a mistake. After all, the Nothing Phone 3a is predicted to cost a fraction of the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, so there would be no reason for Nothing to mislead about its capabilities.</p><p>With that being said, this mistake adds a permanent asterisk to what would've been a favorable performance from the Nothing Phone 3a.</p><p>Nothing will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">officially reveal the Phone 3a on March 4</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is allegedly planning to bring back its Premium Lite subscription after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-axing-premium-lite-service">axing it in 2023</a>. You'll no longer have to pay full price for both YouTube Premium and YouTube Music to avoid ads while binging YouTube playlists and podcasts.</p><p>According to a source "familiar with the plans" at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/youtube-plans-lower-priced-ad-free-version-of-paid-video-tier">Bloomberg</a>, the YouTube Premium Lite package "will be announced soon in the U.S., Australia, Germany, and Thailand."</p><p>"As part of our commitment to provide our users with more choice and flexibility, we've been testing a new YouTube Premium offering with most videos ad-free in several of our markets," a YouTube spokesperson told the site. "We're hoping to expand this offering to even more users in the future."</p><p>Google began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-new-youtube-premium-lite-subscription">testing Premium Lite late last year</a> in Australia, Germany, and Thailand, though not the United States. Users would see "limited ads" — meaning ads before music videos and ad banners on the website — and they'd no longer have access to certain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> perks like background play and offline downloads.</p><p>The vast majority of YouTube content would be ad-free, however. And the dip in cost <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@funkenstille.dev/post/DBMivGMsmEl?xmt=AQGztzAV1AWt4_dxXlUTDexOFadmjikNE2iOrhXIG4G6DXI" target="_blank">from €12.99 to €5.99</a> — or from A$23 to A$12 — made these trade-offs very tempting for users who already pay for another expensive music service, such as Spotify or Apple Music, or who don't watch many music videos.</p>

<p>Now, based on this breaking report, it appears that U.S.-based YouTube power users will have the choice to spend about half as much as before for ad-free content. Bloomberg's source didn't share a price, but the $6–8 range seems likely given its test price in other countries last year.</p><p>"This new tier, if widely adopted, could make subscription revenue a larger and more significant part" of YouTube content creators' revenue than ads, Bloomberg suggests.</p>
<h2 id="google-has-pleasantly-surprised-me-with-this-move-2">Google has pleasantly surprised me with this move</h2>
<p>Last year, I wrote a <em>controversial</em> post claiming that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-made-a-mistake-with-youtube-premium">Google made a mistake with YouTube Premium</a> by coupling it with YouTube Music with no alternative, noting that paying to remove ads is, by itself, not something that should cost $14/month and that bringing back a Premium Lite plan would solve this problem.</p><p>The comment section was less than kind to my argument, calling it ridiculous, half-baked, and so on. It didn't matter that most other streaming services only charged about $6 to remove ads because they weren't free like YouTube. YouTube Premium was worth the value to them, content needs to cost money, and I was cheap and whiny for arguing otherwise.</p><p>A less hostile response came from a YouTube rep at the time, who contacted me to clarify that Google wasn't done with Premium Lite, even though they'd shut down this price tier almost a year prior and had no public plans about it. That sounded promising.</p><p>Now, almost a year later, it appears that I'm getting exactly what I wanted: ad-free YouTube for about half the price it costs now, even if it means missing out on offline downloads and other experimental, Premium-only features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">4X-speed videos and higher-quality audio</a>.</p><p>Assuming Bloomberg's report is accurate, and YouTube Premium Lite really does launch soon in the U.S. for about half the price of YouTube Premium, I'll be a day-one subscriber. It'll no longer feel like an irresponsible subscription, given that I already pay for a family music bundle on another platform.</p><p>More generally, by making this choice, Google will increase its total number of subscribers, even if its YouTube Music subscriber count decreases. It'll be interesting to see whether YouTube Premium Lite expands to more countries or remains limited to the current four. And hopefully, unlike the last time, Premium Lite will stick around for a while.</p>

Grab the Amazfit GTR 3 Pro from Amazon today, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H5VPVKS"><strong>you can score a jaw-dropping 33% discount,</strong></a> knocking the price of the smartwatch down to a mere $99.99. That&apos;s the cheapest that the watch has been all year, and it totally beats the discount we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday last fall. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8af69d4a-af3f-4fa8-9323-ed21f6648994" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H5VPVKS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="aCVQfroUwdJvhrLDe3bvsJ" name="amazfit-gtr-3-pro-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aCVQfroUwdJvhrLDe3bvsJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazfit GTR 3 Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H5VPVKS" data-dimension112="8af69d4a-af3f-4fa8-9323-ed21f6648994" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99"><del>$149.99</del> <strong>$99.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a simple smartwatch with great battery life and built-in sports modes; you like minimalist design and AMOLED displays.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want to experience the latest in wearable technology; you want to use third-party apps or an onboard keyboard. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-gtr-3-pro-review">Amazfit GTR 3 Pro</a> may not win any awards for innovation nowadays, but it&apos;s an affordable smartwatch with up to 14 days of battery life, 5ATM water resistance, and a vibrant AMOLED display. It also comes with over 150 sports modes and a ton of health and fitness tracking features straight out of the box.</p><p>So what&apos;s the catch? Well, you&apos;re not going to get any of the fancy AI features found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches of 2025</a>, there&apos;s no way to integrate third-party apps, and some of the UI features already felt kind of dated way back in 2021.</p><p>Buying the GTR 3 Pro today means settling for a no-frills, fitness-focused wearable with a nice display and great battery life that belies some relatively simple hardware. If that sounds alright and you have 100 bucks to spend, then this is the smartwatch deal for you.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung listed three unreleased A-series Galaxy phones on its Chilean service website.</li><li>The phones are the Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266), Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366), and Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566).</li><li>This listing suggests a release is imminent and the phones should debut next month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has a few new Galaxy A-series budget smartphones in the pipeline, and that's not just a rumor anymore. The company updated the service list on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/cl/support/outofwarrantyservice/" target="_blank">Chilean website</a> to include the unreleased Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26, which are expected to release next month. The listings include the official retail names and model numbers for the devices, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-lists-galaxy-a56-galaxy-a36-galaxy-a26-its-website/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the listing confirms that the Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26 will be sold in Chile. The website includes the price list for out-of-warranty repairs for Galaxy phones, including now the unreleased A-series devices. Since they aren't out yet, the repair prices are simply listed as "not available," which is unsurprising. However, it does share the official names and model numbers for the devices, which are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566)</li></ul>
<p>The inclusion of upcoming A-series Galaxy phones on the service list suggests that a release is imminent. The phones are expected to launch in the first week or two in March, just like their predecessors.</p>

<p>According to prior leaks, the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G may be powered by a Samsung Exynos 1580 chipset and could support 45W wired charging for the first time. However, that's unclear at the moment. While leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-a56-and-galaxy-a36-renders-surface">revealed the design of the Galaxy A56</a>, the exact specifications are shrouded in a bit more secrecy.</p><p>The refreshed design likely includes a unibody rear camera housing with three cameras, covered by a black shell — mimicking the DSLR-style covers that already appeared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The Galaxy A56 could come in pink, gray, and green, with the cheaper Galaxy A36 being available in green, gray, and purple, per leaks.</p><p>We'll learn more about all three models — the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A26 5G — as this official confirmation is a sign release is nearing.</p>

<p>Google is highlighting the various uses of Pixel Call Assist on its smartphones, while also drawing attention to new updates.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-call-assist-call-notes-tips/">blog post</a>, the company detailed a couple of ways users can lean on the Phone app to handle "too many spam calls." While Pixels can conduct a reverse number search for unknown calls, Google is preparing to roll out a new set of filters. The post states the Phone app will soon roll out five filters: All, Missed, Contacts, Non-Spam, and Spam.</p><p>These filters will be available in the "Recent" tab of the Phone app once it hits devices. The post did not state when this update will begin rolling out on Android.</p><p>Google also detailed an upcoming update for the Pixel phone call interface (UI). The company states the update is aimed at making the Pixel Call Assist feature quicker to access. Additionally, the update will make tools like Call Notes, Direct My Call, and Audio Emoji much easier to find and utilize.</p><p>Regarding that note, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/pixel-phone-call-redesign-filters/">9to5Google</a> post shed some light on this, stating the UI update has supposedly arrived on the Pixel 9 series. The publication highlights Google's slight UI rework, which displays a row above your standard phone call tools (numpad, mute, etc.).</p><p>There, users will find a Call Assist button that opens to offer its features, as well as a way to expand the Audio Emoji function.</p>

<p>The post draws attention to a couple of other useful Phone call features like Live Caption and Call Screen. The former is a useful accessibility tool that lets users who are deaf or hard of hearing to read what's being said on the other end. Additionally, those users will be given a keyboard to type their response and the app will read what you've said to them.</p><p>Call Screen lets users allow the AI to answer a phone call or "Ask if urgent." What's said on the other end will be relayed to you via text on your display. More importantly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro</a> deliver "AI-powered suggested replies" if toggled on.</p><p>Google started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-audio-emoji-update-spotted">Audio Emoji update</a> last spring, which made calls much more expressive. These quirky emojis play a unique sound (depending on the emoji) alongside a fun animation on their display. Six emojis were present during the feature's arrival like the laughing emoji, party favors, and drum.</p><p>The Phone app received a beta late last year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">real-time scam detection</a>. The feature is AI-based and is a tool that automatically runs in the background. Google states that the detector will scan incoming calls and, if they are (potentially) a scam, it will deliver a bright red pop-up to users about it. The pop-up will let you quickly end the call to avoid accidentally giving personal information.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is discontinuing its app store on Android devices starting Aug. 20 this year. In an update to App developers, the company stated that they will no longer be accepting new apps for the store moving forward(via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-app-store-on-android/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a>). Developers can continue to update existing apps on the Appstore until the above deadline.</p><p>The Amazon Appstore is currently available in 200 countries and allows users to download games and mobile apps on supported devices.  It is a third-party app store that comes pre-installed on all Amazon devices.</p><p>However, it has always been an alternative Appstore for Android users that offers free apps and content that isn't found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store.</a></p><p>On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/appstore/android/faq" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>, Amazon stated that "any apps downloaded from the Amazon Appstore will not be guaranteed to operate on Android devices," after Aug.20.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh wait what, Amazon App Store discontinued on Android Devices. pic.twitter.com/CQvxcXe4LP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1892543928638861606">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Android Central in an email that it has decided to take this step with Android devices as the company is looking inward and wants to focus its efforts "on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that’s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it.”</p><p>According to the company, only a small number of customers use the app store outside Amazon devices, which pushed them to take this step.</p><p>Amazon added that its virtual currency aka Amazon Coins, which users use to purchase eligible apps and in-app items from the Appstore will also be discontinued. The company will refund unused coins to users after Aug.20. That said, the Appstore will remain untouched on Amazon's devices like the Fire TV and Fire Tablet.</p><p>It looks like Amazon is following suit after what went down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/windows-11-ending-android-app-support-announcement" target="_blank">Microsoft devices last year</a>. Windows 11 users at least got a year's headstart on this shift. As of  March 5, even Microsoft devices will no longer support several apps available on the Amazon Appstore once this date arrives.</p>

<p>Meta says the new fund is designed to appeal to a growing audience of players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">who prefer free-to-play content</a>, similar to audiences on other mobile platforms. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/empowering-horizon-creators-with-a-new-50m-fund-and-advanced-tools-for-mobile-and-mr-worlds">Meta's blog post</a> on the announcement says the new move is aimed to grow these mobile, non-VR audiences by reaching "a lot of new people who don’t yet own a Quest headset and ultimately grow the pie for everyone."</p><p>The logic, Meta dictates, is that people who enjoy Horizon Worlds will be more inclined to purchase a Meta Quest headset to try the experiences in VR. But Meta couldn't be more wrong here, and while I ultimately think hybrid experiences like this — that means VR and non-VR players can game with each other — are the future of gaming as a whole, Meta's focus on Horizon Worlds is simply unhealthy for everyone.</p><p>Meta's CTO recently said that 2025 would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">make-or-break year</a> for Horizon Worlds, so while it's not surprising to see the company make a last-ditch effort to catalyze better development for Horizon Worlds, it's beyond frustrating to see the company continue to push the Roblox-like platform over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> at the expense of existing VR developers.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I fully believed that Meta Horizon Worlds could co-exist with more premium experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>. Other platforms seem to have no problem juggling the balance between offering free-to-play and premium experiences to users who prefer one over the other, but Meta has shown that it's not very good at multitasking.</p><p>Instead, a quick visit to the Meta Horizon app on your phone always shows a ton of Horizon Worlds content that you may or may not want. The premium app store can be found by clicking a tiny icon on the top left of the app, and promotional content for these kinds of experiences has substantially waned over the past six months.</p><p>This huge shift in focus for Meta has had a profound impact on the VR industry, as a whole. Instead of developers seeing record game sales after the launch of a new headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> launch was decidedly different. Many VR developers saw flat or even lower sales throughout the Holiday 2024 period when compared to 2023, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/from-quest-to-horizon-how-metas-shifting-priorities-are-affecting-developers/">the results haven't been pretty</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lots of video game developers have closed their doors or made substantial layoffs this year. While this unfortunate reality isn't relegated just to the VR market, it hurts more in VR because there aren't as many bigger developers as on traditional consoles or PC. Just in the last month alone, we've seen major layoffs at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/toast-interactive-closes-office-as-majority-of-staff-are-made-redundant-2/">Toast Interactive</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/crytek-laying-off-15-percent-of-staff/">Crytek</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/fast-travel-games-layoffs-january-2025/">Fast Travel Games</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/soul-assembly-layoffs-january-2025/">Soul Assembly</a>, and even the app market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sidequest-holds-layoffs-amid-changing-market/">SideQuest</a>.</p><p>Wider industry trends are somewhat to blame for these problems, but Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p><p>I had already planned to write this post before I found out about Meta's new creator program, and its existence only further solidifies my opinion here. The first thing you see when opening the <em>required </em>Meta Quest companion app isn't the best games on the platform. It's janky free-to-play garbage that's an instant turn-off to anyone who isn't 8 years old, and that's a <strong>huge</strong> problem.</p>

<p>Meta, it's time to give up the ghost. Horizon Worlds isn't going to be The Oasis from Ready Player One. It's not even going to be Rec Room or VR Chat, two <em>very</em> successful VR "metaverse-style" experiences that existed far before Horizon Worlds was ever a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg's eye.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, if you're reading this, it's OK to accept Horizon Worlds as a "failure" to capitalize early enough on a growing trend. So instead of tanking the successful Quest ecosystem and its development community, focus on the best experiences available on the platform and start promoting those, instead.</p><p>With the VP of VR on the way out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mark-rabkin-leaving-meta-quest">at the end of the month</a>, this is the perfect time for his replacement to focus on the <em>real</em> metaverse of apps and games that Quest players know and love. Get back to that early 2024 time frame when developers were seeing huge growth and success in their titles with the swath of new players. The Quest 3S just broke sales records, and that should translate into game sales. This fixation on Horizon Worlds could kill off the VR ecosystem you've spent years building up and no one wants that.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-vr-review">Among Us VR</a> launched as one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/2#section-best-quest-3-2-multiplayer-games">favorite multiplayer Quest games</a>, but despite several major updates since 2022, it can be hard to keep a steady user base with so many Quest gamers spending their time in Horizon Worlds or new Gorilla Tag clones. So Schell Games is turning to non-VR Steam gamers with "Among Us 3D," and it's a sign that crossplay might be the best future for VR games.</p><p>Announced on Thursday, Among Us 3D is a new Steam PC port of the original Among Us VR game. Starting as a demo during Steam Next Fest from February 24–March 3, Among Us 3D will eventually let Steam gamers play as crewmates and imposters with VR gamers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, PSVR 2, and Steam VR.</p>

<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, project director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we're opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends — your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p><p>Among Us 3D is available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">wishlist on Steam</a> today, though there's currently no release date. Among Us VR on Quest will be "rebranded to Among Us 3D" in the coming months, adding a new in-game currency called Stardust to "expand customization options" and "support the expansion of the game." It's possible that Schell Games wants the original Quest game ready before launching the non-VR port.</p><p>After the full launch, Schell and Innersloth are promsing new modes and tasks, as well as "collabs" with the original Among Us. Despite the image below, don't expect actual crossplay between the 2D and 3D Among Us versions: It simply refers to original, fan-favorite cosmetics coming to the 3D version.</p>

<p>Despite having fewer maps than the main version, Among Us VR impressed us with its loving recreation of Skeld and seamless VR motion controls for beloved tasks, as well as proximity chat to make you truly feel like a crewmate in danger or an imposter listening for witnesses. And we appreciated post-launch updates like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-polus-hands-on">Polus Point map</a>.</p><p>With Among Us 3D, Schell Games is committing to continuing to support the VR version, but using an influx of Steam gamers to keep funding their work and add fresh bodies to their murderous little world. The main question will be how the VR-centric controls have been ported to keyboard-and-mouse controls.</p>

<p>Meta Quest games are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">going through a free-to-play crisis</a>. The Quest Store overall is making more money than ever, but most often via in-app purchases in free-to-play titles. Meta's metaverse is a jumble of Gorilla Tag clones attracting younger gamers, while the more polished VR titles struggle to get proper storefront space or make back their development costs.</p><p>We've seen how many of the best VR multiplayer games have struggled with user retention, or else didn't make enough money to keep up with updates; Echo: VR is the most notorious example, shutting down despite its critical acclaim and avid fanbase.</p><p>Now, with Among Us VR turning into Among Us 3D, we're seeing a potential new pathway that more VR studios could take: Convert their VR-only game into a non-VR, first-person experience that adds an influx of gamers but still supports their original fanbase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a" name="Breachers-screenshot-official-Factory-gun-upgrade.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Breachers on Meta Quest" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Breachers VR on Quest </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Triangle Factory)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many original Steam games have Steam VR ports, but these are secondary add-ons, and we've seen for years how PC VR is a niche platform for a few die-hard enthusiasts — not an especially profitable or popular one. Ideally, we'd see more Quest games that jump to Steam, with the largest VR and PC communities joining together.</p><p>Even if they're <em>better</em> in VR, multiplayer shooters like Contractors, Breachers, and Ghosts of Tabor would work on flat screens, too, and they'd launch with a dedicated user base so new Steam gamers would know they'd immediately have people to play with. Plus, VR gamers feeling too lazy to put on their headsets — or who notice their Quest 3 battery is dying — can keep the fun going on their gaming rigs.</p><p>Perhaps this kind of VR-to-traditional gaming transition is more difficult than we're making it sound; or perhaps these games' fanbases would balk at resources going to a new version they won't care about. But we still think this kind of strategy will give VR devs the resources they need to keep making great games despite a challenging sales climate, and that's a great thing in our books!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is continuing to alter the Assistant within its ever-changing ecosystem, and this latest move impacts audio devices.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/326148532/google-assistant-spoken-notifications-change-on-headphones?hl=en&sjid=7078688767109123196-NA">community post</a>, the company drew attention to an upcoming change that will affect how users interact with the Google Assistant on headphones (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-assistant-earbuds-losing-tap-and-hold-notifications/">Android Police</a>). Google states the Assistant will soon lose the ability to read your notifications aloud when "pressed to activate."</p><p>In addition to this, the post states users will no longer be able to leverage the Assistant to reply to notifications, either.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7515695?hl=en">follow-up support</a> document expands on this, stating users will now have to manage the Assistant vocally. Instead of pressing a button, the Assistant will only respond to "Hey Google, read my notifications" moving forward.</p><p>Curiously, Google states it "will be" making this change to all headphones with Assistant as its virtual helper. However, the post fails to explicitly state when users can see this change go into effect. It'll be worth keeping an eye on things as we enter the final week of February.</p><p>It seems like we should brace for a future where we lose this ability on two of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-headphones-support-google-assistant#section-best-over-ear">headphones with the Assistant</a>: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Sony's WH-1000XM5. We <em>could </em>say we're surprised by this development, but we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">the same thing happen</a> to earbuds with Google Assistant support in September. Things happened in reverse order as users took to Reddit to report the sudden jarring change to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>Users were hit with a message stating, "touch and hold won't read notifications anymore." Similarly, they were told to say "Hey Google" aloud for those functions. It didn't sit well with users as they stated the touch-and-hold method was more private and convenient — but most of all <em>silent</em>.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google at the time and the company stated it made the change "based on user feedback." It also confirmed that the change would stick, forcing users to have to speak aloud to the AI. The company reiterated a similar tune with its headphone announcement, meaning those users will lose out on the private touch-and-hold method.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> debuted in August with deep integration with Gemini, instead of the Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit has been spotted pushing a light update to a few of its most recent smartwatches and trackers.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236725#zippy=%2Ccharge">support page</a>, the wearable company is rolling out version 214.22 to the following devices: Charge 6, Sense 2, Versa 4, and the Inspire 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/fitbit-charge-6-sense-2-update/">9to5Google</a>). The latest patch brings enhanced "Bluetooth security" features to the Charge 6 and Inspire 3. Google states, after updating, users will be asked to "reconnect your device when prompted in the Fitbit app."</p><p>The other significant portion of this update concerns new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14225687#Charge6_status_indicators&zippy=%2Ccharge">status indicators</a>."</p><p>All four wearables are receiving this small update today (Feb 20). The support document states these new status indicators will appear when users first wake up their watch's or tracker's clock face. Fitbit's update brings four icons, such as a DND sign and a crescent moon. The former indicates your wearable's Do Not Disturb mode is on while the latter regards "sleep mode."</p><p>Fitbit also added a red battery symbol, signaling your watch's power is severely low. The final symbol is a crossed-out phone, so users know their device has lost its Bluetooth connection with their handheld.</p><p>The company states the status indicators are optional. Users can head into their device's <strong>Settings app > Display > Status Indicators </strong>to toggle them on/off. Moreover, these indicators are not permanently on your display. They will display after a few seconds; however, you can "swipe right to check the icons at the top of quick settings."</p>

<p>Fitbit's devices have been left stagnant for a while as its most recent (major) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-update-features-modes-app-rollout">update came last July</a>. The update was spearheaded by Google as it inherited Fitbit's line of watches and trackers. The company plugged its machine learning into Fitbit's devices to improve its heart rate accuracy. The Inspire 3 received 20 new exercise modes last summer and other QoL (quality of life) enhancements.</p><p>The Sense 2 and Versa 2 finally gained a dedicated YouTube Music app a year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6</a> got it. Speaking of the latest tracker, the Charge 6 gained additional exercise modes similar to the Inspire 3.</p><p>Fitbit's latest update sings a better tune, especially after Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">massive warning call</a> to Sense and Versa 3 owners about a dangerous battery issue. The devices were prone to extreme overheating issues, which could cause severe burns to the user's wrist if inflicted. Google started rolling out a software patch to correct the issue; however, owners of a device prone to overheating could've submitted a form for compensation.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android Auto users have been having bumpy starts to their car drives, thanks to a new update that may have messed up the connectivity between the two.</p><p>Many took to Google forums in the past few days stating that their Android Auto suddenly stopped working ( via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/19/android-auto-wireless-broken-reports-13-5/#more-662203" target="_blank"> 9to5 Google)</a>. According to them, this issue could be due to the latest software update patch that came in at the end of January or early February that is causing the wireless connectivity to break.</p><p>Some users<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/323764003/wireless-android-auto-stopped-working-after-january-2025-update?hl=en&sjid=6661046456060814083-NA"> reported</a> the wireless connection failing once they updated to the latest version of the firmware, and Android Auto not being able to detect their device. But when the device is connected via USB, it seems to function as usual.</p><p>The patches in question are Android Auto v13.4 and v13.5, but we can't say for sure if this is what's causing the widespread issue. It could also be how some devices are interacting with the latest update. For now people with the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier"> Pixel 8</a>, Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S20, with different car models seem to be facing this issue.</p><p>"After a year and a half, my 2023 Honda Civic no longer shows "Android Auto" for wireless. And when searching for my phone, the car screen says the car cannot find the Galaxy S20 phone.  It's been working mostly fine. And my phone's AA is recently updated," a user stated on the forum.</p><p>The people facing issues have tried all sorts of troubleshooting methods, but nothing seems to be fixing this issue. One user however noted that unless they restarted their phone each time, Android Auto didn't seem to connect.</p><p>We don't have any official guidelines from Google on how they plan to fix this issue. However, this isn't the first time an update has caused havoc for users, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/279134372/android-auto-not-connecting-after-may-24th-update?hl=en" target="_blank">May last year users faced </a>a somewhat similar issue trying to connect their devices via USB and the app wouldn't recognize their devices. Users either had to reboot their phones or buy a different USB cable that sorted the issue out for them.</p><p>Google's spokesperson told Android Central in an email that they're aware of this issue and are currently investigating a fix for the same.</p><p>Despite said connectivity issues, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-into-the-polestar-2-to-cover-some-gaps-in-android-automotive" target="_blank">Android Auto expanded its latest software </a>update for Polestar 2, P3.3.16, which came with HD radio and smoother low-speed driving, with wired Android Auto.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 is just a few short weeks from now, and companies have already begun to tease what's in store for the big annual show. Honor just launched a pair of new phones so it looks like the company will be focusing on the software front for MWC this year, pushing forward with a new AI-focused concept it calls the Honor Alpha Plan.</p><p>Last year's launch of the Honor Magic 6 Pro came with a full commitment to leading with AI-forward features, particularly where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">the phone's camera</a> was concerned. At the time, the concept was still fairly new among phones, as Samsung had just announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and most other AI-powered features baked into Android used AI before the term was in vogue.</p><p>The biggest issue with Honor's AI launch last year was compatibility with non-Honor devices and services. The rollout of Magic OS 9 alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> helped push that forward, with features like Magic Portal receiving support for hundreds of apps and a cool knuckle gesture that works a lot like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to search</a>. This builds on Google's function by making it easy to share things you circle, not just search for them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ" name="honor-magic-portal-2025-demo" alt="Circling a paragraph with a finger knuckle and then immediately sharing it to X using Honor Magic Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At MWC, we expect big things from the brand-new CEO of Honor, Jian Li, who just replaced previous CEO George Zhao in mid-January. No doubt, Li is looking to make his mark on the company as he sets the tone for the rest of the year, and the Honor Alpha Plan sounds exactly like what we might expect.</p><p>As you might imagine from the name, the word "Alpha" is the beginning of the Greek alphabet and likely a new path forward for the company's AI pursuits. Companies are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending more on AI in 2025 than ever</a>, and the crown for the best AI in the land seems to change every week. It's not likely that Honor is going to jump into the fray with the likes of Open AI, Grok, Gemini, and Deepseek, but it certainly would make sense for the company to start launching more AI-forward devices in the future.</p><p>The question is whether that means adding more AI-enhanced features to its phones — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">brand-new AI telephoto feature</a> on the Magic 7 Pro — or if it means dedicated AI devices. One pioneer in this sector, the Humane AI Pin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">just called it quits</a>. While the concept of a screenless device powered by an AI assistant is extremely futuristic, Humane's implementation of the concept left a lot to be desired.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-7-rsr-provence-04" alt="The back of the Provence PORSCHE DESIGN Honor Magic 7 RSR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I could easily see a company like Honor moving in to take advantage of the interest in this market by using its expertise on AI and device ecosystems. Honor already produces laptops, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more that all link together in impressively cohesive ways.</p><p>I use an Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon Edition as my main laptop, and it pairs perfectly (and seamlessly) with the Honor Magic 7 RSR and two Honor tablets that I have. Using a tablet as a second laptop screen is as easy as hitting the "connect" button that pops up when the tablet is unlocked, and the same goes for bigger screen foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Most of the company's improvement happened throughout 2024, and 2025 looks to be the best year yet. Android Central Phones editor Harish Jonnalagadda wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-is-innovating-its-way-to-the-top">Honor's impressive upward trajectory</a>, and I have no doubt the new CEO is aiming even higher with the Honor Alpha Plan when it's unveiled at MWC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-30.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 in semi-folded mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jian Li comes from a Huawei background, at a time when the company led smartphone camera innovation before U.S. trade sanctions stymied the business for a few years. Now, Li has moved on to the helm of Honor and is clearly ready to take the company to the next level internationally.</p><p>While I could hope for a proper U.S. release of the company's products, I dare not hold my breath in the current political climate. Instead, I think the company will focus even more on unique AI features that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-sharing-feature-magic-portal-3520837/">being copied by rivals</a> and dedicated AI-forward devices that will work well with all sorts of devices, not just Honor's.</p><p>After all, the Alpha Plan's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/news/honor-alpha-plan-mwc2025/">currently laid-out vision</a> states that Honor "is committed to fostering an open and collaborative environment where innovation thrives through partnership." Given that the latest Honor devices work better than ever with Google's own Gemini services, it makes sense to me that Honor would push itself to be the leading international Android brand, especially since Samsung has been so stagnant in the past few years.</p>
