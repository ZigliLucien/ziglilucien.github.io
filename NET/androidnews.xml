                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">tested the DiskStation DS925+</a> when it debuted earlier this year, and while I liked the changes to the hardware, Synology's HDD limitation — where it disallowed any WD and Seagate drives from being used in the NAS — ultimately made it a non-starter. The move meant that you couldn't use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> with the DS925+, and this ultimately hurt the brand, allowing rivals like UGREEN to make considerable inroads.</p><p>Thankfully, Synology is making amends now; the brand is rolling out the DiskStation Manager 7.3 update, which removes the HDD limitation. This makes it possible to use WD Red, Seagate IronWolf, and any other NAS HDD with 2025 DiskStation models. The move also means that Synology's latest models are no longer hobbled, and I'm eager to get my hands on the new launches to see how they hold up against their predecessors. The caveat is that the M.2 drive limitation is still in effect, so you can only slot in Synology's SSDs to create storage pools.</p><p>The 2025 portfolio includes the 2-bay DiskStation DS225+ and DS725+, the 4-bay DiskStation DS425+ and DS925+, and the enthusiast models: DiskStation DS1525+ and DiskStation DS1825+. I tested the DS925+ and have the DS225+ and DS425+ on hand to test at the moment, and will share my opinion on these NAS models shortly.</p><p>To be clear, this limitation only affected the 2025 DiskStation models; earlier NAS servers didn't have this particular limitation. When I asked the brand about what HDD models it tested with its 2025 portfolio, I was told that DSM 7.3 removes any restrictions in this area, so any HDD will work with the latest NAS models. The best part is that this will extend to value-focused and J series models launching down the line:</p><p>"Synology is collaborating with drive manufacturers to expand the range of certified storage media, delivering more reliable options. In the meantime, 2025 model-year DiskStation Plus, Value, and J Series running DSM 7.3 will support installation and storage pool creation with third-party drives¹. Together with the existing support for third-party drive migration, DSM will provide users with greater flexibility in managing their storage deployments."</p><p>In addition to lifting the HDD limitations, DSM 7.3 comes with new features in Synology Drive, email moderation in MailPlus, and security updates. To its credit, Synology clearly listened to user feedback by walked back its earlier policy, and the ability to use WD and Seagate drives on its latest NAS models puts the 2025 DiskStation models back into contention.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is probably the sleekest flip phone of 2025, thanks to its slimmer body and expansive cover screen. Thankfully, Samsung didn't increase the price of its popular flip phone this year, which means that we can look forward to some sleek deals during Amazon Prime Big Deal days, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7JTH9GK">23% discount available now</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> normally retails for $1,099, which isn't too bad considering its closest competitor normally costs $200 more. However, at $250 off, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 can be had for just $849. It's not exactly cheap, but it's a great deal regardless, and cheaper than what you'd normally pay for a base Galaxy S25 or Pixel 10.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7K4BRZJ">512GB variant is also on sale</a>, reducing the original price of $1,219 to $919. Power users may want to consider this option, as it lacks support for microSD cards, which would provide expanded storage.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE — see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-7-continues-to-undercut-its-closest-competition-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 7 continues to undercut its closest competition</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="428f8138-f605-4d59-8d5a-f4ae5879cfb6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check — Best Buy: $849" data-dimension48="Price check — Best Buy: $849" data-dimension25="$849.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7JTH9GK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>This 23% discount on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 brings the phone to its lowest price since launch.

Firstly, at 6.5mm (13.7mm closed) when open, it's much thinner than its predecessor, which goes a long way to making it more pocketable. After all, flip phones become quite thick when closed, which some may find bothersome.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-benchmarked-exynos-2500">Exynos 2500</a> chipset powering the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may not be quite as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, but Android Central contributor Brady Snyder says that it performed well during his testing.</p><p>The main display is expansive, and the crease is nearly non-existent for anyone who might be concerned about that. Then there's the cover screen. At 4.1 inches, it's quite large, making it ideal for taking selfies, answering notifications, or playing supported games. You can actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-to-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen</a>, although it will require some maneuvering. Still, it's a handy feature that not many people would know about the phone out of the box.</p><p>One UI has also come a long way, and Samsung has a robust feature set. You get access to Google's AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, plus Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite. This brings features like AI Select, live translation, image generation, smart replies, and more. And for better privacy, you can opt for on-device AI processing, meaning your data doesn't get sent to the cloud.</p><p>Another big plus is that anyone interested can also pick from an expansive selection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a>.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-2">Shop All Amazon Deals — Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Eventually, I got sick of dealing with router issues, and just told everyone to get Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro routers — that's a true story. They're so easy to use, requiring only two cables and a few taps in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home app for iOS or Android</a> to get started. My parents figured it out while I was across the country, and that's a testament to the Nest Wi-Fi Pro's ease-of-use.</p><p>The software experience gets better as you continue using the Nest Wi-Fi Pro. You can open up the Google Home app to test your entire network's connection, or even a specific access point. It'll let you know when something's not right automatically with a push notification. My Nest router usually lets me know when there's an outage before my internet service provider knows.</p><p>Within the app, you can control everything from the brightness of the status light to the network settings. There's even an option to restart a Wi-Fi access point remotely — no more trying to unplug and plug in your router.</p><p>Notably, the Nest Wi-Fi Pro only supports Wi-Fi 6E, not the newer Wi-Fi 7 standard. That's a bit of a bummer, but Google's claimed top speeds of up to 5.4 Gbps will be more than enough for most people. It's over five times the speed of my own internet plan. Additionally, Wi-Fi 6E uses three frequency bands — 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz — to reduce interference and bring you faster real-world wireless speeds.</p><p>I have a 1-Gig plan, and routinely hit 900Mbps wireless speeds on my Nest Wi-Fi Pro network, which is pretty outstanding. That's exactly what you want to see as an Android user. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a> supports Wi-Fi 6E, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> all support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>.

The fact that it has now become an almost creaseless flip phone that you can use as an old-school video recorder when it's closed, and it fits right in your pocket, is incredible.

At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-Membership-Porcelain/dp/B0CC63GZ3R"><strong>$109.95 (31% off)</strong></a>, it's a solid entry point to Fitbit insights in a lightweight band, and it can sync with your phone for Google Maps turn-by-turn arrows and YouTube Music controls. Still, we've seen it cheaper before ($99), and you can get a better value below this price from another brand: Amazfit.</p><p>As someone who reviewed the Charge 6 and dozens of other fitness watches and bands, my advice for anyone looking to spend $100 or less is to try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YNMBX"><strong>Amazfit Active 2 for $80.74 (19% off)</strong></a> instead, or match the Charge 6 deal price with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ"><strong>Active 2 Premium for $109.99 (15% off)</strong></a>.</p><p>The Active 2 (43g) only weighs slightly more than the Charge 6 (31g), and in exchange, you get a 1.32-inch, 2,000-nit AMOLED display instead of a 1.04-inch, 450-nit strip with tiny notifications. Both have built-in GPS, but the Charge 6 only lasts 5 hours to the Active 2's 21 hours, and lacks an altimeter for good elevation tracking. The Active 2 even matches the Charge 6 with blood oxygen and skin temperature readings, while adding a mic & speaker for calls and commands!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f3b45318-3585-4e87-9e5c-6db304340273" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension48="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension25="$80.74" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YNMBX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="oxJNscDFhdNsubUbuhTRhh" name="Amazfit-Active-2-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxJNscDFhdNsubUbuhTRhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ" data-dimension112="f3b45318-3585-4e87-9e5c-6db304340273" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension48="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension25="$80.74"><del>$129.99</del><strong> $109.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Not only is the Active 2 one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">best Amazfit watches</a> on the market for sheer value, but it's just a solid all-around fitness watch, with perks like GPS, Bluetooth calling, downloadable routes, and Zepp Coach daily run recommendations that you'd normally find on much pricier <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a>.</p><p>Its Prime Day price is less than $1 off from its previous all-time low ($79.99).

So I don't mind if you ignore my recommendation and grab one of those instead, prioritizing comfort over better notifications and a more traditional watch design.</p><p>For now, the Charge 6 is an excellent, if limited, device with a small screen that takes getting used to. You're getting an improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adding-ai-powered-health-coach-fitbit-and-pixel-watch">Fitbit AI Coach with Gemini</a> later this month, but only if you keep paying for a subscription after the six-month free trial. Amazfit's Zepp Coaching isn't as polished, but you'll save more money in the long run by avoiding any Fitbit Premium dependence.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel 10 hasn't even been on store shelves for two months, and it's already getting a surprisingly good Prime Big Deal Days discount that we weren't expecting!</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> went on sale on August 28, retailing for $799. I thought that was a reasonable price, given the upgrades that come with it, but this 19% discount reduces the price by $150, meaning you can buy the Pixel 10 for nearly half of what you'd normally pay for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>But if 128GB isn't enough for you, you can still snag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRK635/">256GB version for $175 off</a>, making it cheaper than the regular price of the 128GB version.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE — see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-pixel-10-is-cheaper-than-ever-2">The Pixel 10 is cheaper than ever</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c2debe29-69b1-4e5e-abc4-9508ecdbb4e8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension48="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension25="$649" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf" name="Google Pixel 10" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>We thought $799 was a reasonable price for the Pixel 10, but at 19% off, there's never been a better time to buy Google's latest flagship phone. At just $649, the Pixel 10 is an absolute steal, especially with all the upgrades it received over the Pixel 9.</p><p><strong>Price check — </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-128gb-unlocked-indigo/J39TC8JG4L" data-dimension112="c2debe29-69b1-4e5e-abc4-9508ecdbb4e8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension48="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension25="$649"><strong>Best Buy: $649</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_10?hl=en-US"><strong>Google: $699</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c2debe29-69b1-4e5e-abc4-9508ecdbb4e8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension48="Price check — Best Buy: $649" data-dimension25="$649">View Deal</a></p></div><p>I reviewed the Pixel 10 not two months ago, and I ended up liking it more than I expected to. You may be tempted to splurge on a "Pro" phone, but the Pixel 10 offers most of what you'd find on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">premium siblings</a>. That includes a large battery, triple camera system with a telephoto lens, Qi magnetic charging, and the new Tensor G5 chipset powering all the new AI features.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">camera quality on the Pixel 10</a> is superb, and it receives a notable boost over the Pixel 9 thanks to the addition of a 5x telephoto camera. This means zoom images are clearer, even at night. New camera features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Auto Best Take</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, make it even easier to capture the perfect image, whether of you and your friends or of objects around you.</p><p>Beyond the camera, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> offers additional unique AI features and is designed for more proactive and ambient AI capabilities. Magic Cue is one such feature, surfacing recommendations and suggestions based on whatever you're doing or who you're talking to. Does someone need to know the details of an upcoming event? Your Calendar entry will be a click away, so you won't have to dig for it. Need to call the airline about your upcoming flight? Your booking details will appear on your screen so they're ready at a moment's notice.</p><p>And it's made even better thanks to a larger battery that easily lasts you all day. The Pixel 10 is also the first flagship Android phone with magnetic Qi2 charging, meaning you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a> without a case. Or, if you wanna protect your phone, there are still plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">great Pixel 10 cases</a> to pick from, including Google's own Pixelsnap cases.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-7">Shop All Amazon Deals — Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, the company has been making arguably the best flip phones over the past couple of years, and its latest, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, just got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2GR6D1D">a pretty nice discount</a> for Amazon Prime Big Deal Days.</p><p>At $1,299, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> was hard to recommend, no matter how much I enjoy this phone. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2GWB81K">15% discount on Amazon</a> for nearly every color option brings the price down to $1,099, the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">its closest competitor</a>. Not only that, but one color option gets a massive 24% discount on Amazon, meaning you're paying less than $1,000 for one of our favorite foldable phones.</p><p>And while Amazon offers some great discounts, Best Buy appears to be outdoing it with its own deals, with each color option receiving a 24% discount, which is over $300 off.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE — see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="my-favorite-flip-phone-just-hit-a-new-low-2">My favorite flip phone just hit a new low</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9afde387-71d5-48fd-8cac-b06cb9966c9a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check — Best Buy: $984.99" data-dimension48="Price check — Best Buy: $984.99" data-dimension25="$984.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2GR6D1D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="h8NADmDNduWhr7gwZHd5f5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-official-render-Scarab-5" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8NADmDNduWhr7gwZHd5f5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just hit its best price on Amazon, with a 25% discount on the Pantone Scarab colorway, slashing its exorbitant price down to something much more manageable.

The expansive cover screen makes it easy to use all my favorite apps without having to open the phone. It also lets me take the best selfies and lets others preview themselves before I capture a photo. It's incredibly versatile and perfect for content creators, thanks to all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">flip phone camera tricks at your disposal</a>.</p><p>This is also a true flagship, rivaling even Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in terms of specs. The Razr Ultra 2025 features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, a massive 18GB of RAM, and a minimum of 512GB of storage (up to 1TB). It's quite the powerhouse! Motorola also managed to stuff a 4,700mAh battery inside to keep it going all day, and 68W charging means you can top it up at no time at all. The specs alone are why you should pick the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Razr Ultra 2025 over the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>You also get access to Google AI features like Circle to Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, as well as Motorola's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI suite</a> for image generation, text summarization, and more.</p><p>Pantone Scarab is one of my favorite colors, as it features a beautiful green hue and soft Alcantara fabric that feels absolutely marvelous in the hand. But if that's not for you, the tough Pantone Mountain Trail might be more your speed, with a durable wood (yes, real wood) back.</p><p>You can't go wrong with any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Razr Ultra 2025 color options</a>, especially at this Prime Big Deal Days price.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-12">Shop All Amazon Deals — Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I use a pair of JBL Stage 2 bookshelf speakers for my vinyl record setup, and have owned various models of the brand's Go, Clip, Flip, Charge, and Pulse wireless portable speakers. After trying them all, I find myself coming back to the Go 3 for its size and affordability.</p><p>It's the smallest of JBL's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">portable Bluetooth speakers</a>, and that means it won't sound as loud or as crisp as bigger and more-expensive models. However, this is meant to be a cheap and durable speaker that can survive bike rides, runs, or beach and pool trips with ease. It can fit in a pocket or be easily clipped onto a bag or electric scooter, making the Go 3 a portability champion.</p><p>As the name suggests, the JBL Go 3 is a Bluetooth speaker designed to be used on-the-go, and it's incredibly handy for doing just that. I'd recommend it for use as a beach or pool speaker, or even for runners and hikers — it's small enough to comfortably fit in the palm of your hand. With Bluetooth 5.1 support, it'll pair great with any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">modern Android phone</a>, and many more Bluetooth-equipped devices.</p><p>For those who want something just a bit better and more durable than their smartphone, the JBL Go 3 is a standout option, especially when it's under $30.

But this time around, the "Plus" model was skipped over.</p><p>On the bright side, the Tab S10 Plus is still getting basically all of the new software features that Samsung introduced. Really, the only thing you aren't getting is the newly redesigned S Pen that Samsung includes with both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

On a related note, the AI can lean on Spotify's music library for users asking about new music from their favorite artists.</p><p>Whatever you ask ChatGPT to do, whether it's surfacing a certain selection of playlists or asking it to create a playlist full of popular Latin artists, it will surface Spotify's results in the app. Users will see what resembles a Spotify widget in the app. The post states users can tap individual tracks, which will toss them into the Spotify app. However, if you've asked ChatGPT to create a new playlist for you, there will be an "Open in Spotify" option, so you can see everything as it is in the app.</p><h2 id="spotify-in-ai-2">Spotify in AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm" name="spotify-chatgpt-prompt-example" alt="Spotify in ChatGPT lets users link the music platform to the AI app, enabling playlist creation, recommendations, new music ideas, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the ChatGPT app, the post states free, Plus, and Pro accounts can utilize Spotify, so long as they're signed in. This feature is reportedly arriving in over 145 countries this week on Android and iOS.</p><p>It seems fitting that Spotify would lend its musical knowledge to OpenAI's ChatGPT app, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">it did the same thing</a> with Google's Gemini. Those on Android using Gemini can find a Spotify extension, which lets the AI dive into Spotify to try and satisfy the query at hand (there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">also an extension</a> for YouTube Music). In the Gemini app, users can tell the AI to play a specific album, playlist, or ask it to play a song by a specific artist.</p><p>On a grander note, Spotify finally (finally) launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Lossless Listening</a> feature for Premium subscribers in September. While the music you'll hear will be more refined and rich, Lossless Listening comes at the cost of siphoning even more data, so it's worth expressing caution if you're not listening on a Wi-Fi connection. Lossless Listening is available in private playlists and Liked Songs, as well as DJ, Jam, Mix, AI Playlists, and Daylists.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means even the new Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which just launched a month ago, is also seeing a massive price drop, so be sure to grab this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"> <strong>$150 off deal</strong></a> now!</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE prides itself as being a device that comes baked with the stable version of One UI 8, even before it landed on the flagship Galaxy S25 series, which is pretty neat as you get the latest UI right out of the box! The device features a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate. And you also get thinner bezels, which means more screen space to binge on your favorite shows or games.</p><p>While the device is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, which means it's bigger than the standard Galaxy S25, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">is the slimmest and lightest FE phone from Samsung ever,</a> measuring just 7.4mm thin and weighing 190 grams.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in Icyblue" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1133" height="1133" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1" data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$649.99</del></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"><strong>499.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE sports an upgraded chipset, a sleeker design, and a bigger battery with faster charging.

The thing that I really appreciate is the upgraded Exynos 2400 chipset, which keeps the device running smoothly for those long hours of doomscrolling, gaming, or streaming shows.

Amazon also upgraded the E Ink display on the new units, improving the refresh rate and adding a color option (which costs even more, by the way).</p><p>The new Scribes come with 32gb or 64GB of storage, while the 2024 model offers a 16GB option for less. If you don't plan on filling it up with a bunch of apps, that 16GB model is just fine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4" name="amazon-kindle-scribe-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Scribe 2024 lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's, of course, thinner and lighter than the old model too, but I think that's where the big improvements stop. The new 2025 Kindle Scribe features smaller, uniform bezels, but I personally don't want that in a digital notebook.</p><p>I love the large side bezel of the Kindle Scribe models on sale because it provides a comfortable place to hold the tablet while writing. Remember, this is a writing tablet by nature, not a smaller device that you're going to be holding up on the beach for hours.</p><p>And if you were thinking of really splurging to get that color Kindle Scribe model, I'd say hold off for reviews before you plunge in. Color e-readers might be cool but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/black-and-white-e-readers-arent-obsolete-yet">they're not necessarily better</a>, as I've found out after testing dozens of them.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Edifier ES20 is like an affordable dupe of the more premium Marshall Willen II, and with this Prime Day deal, it costs half as much.</p><p>You can choose from an Ivory or Black variant. Both options come with a matching lanyard and colorful RGB lights. That IP67 rating is a solid promise, guaranteeing robust water and dust resistance.

Both speakers are about the same size and boast similar faux leather designs with metal grills. Even the button and battery bar placements are nearly identical.</p><p>What's different about the Edifier ES20 is that it has built-in RGB lights that have several modes. You can keep the lighting steady or change it to other dynamic presets, including one for emergencies. There's a dedicated button to control the light presets.</p><p>The Edifier ES20 portable Bluetooth speaker has a 15-hour battery life and charges via USB-C. You miss out on fast charging, which is a bummer, but it's not uncommon in this price segment. There are also various audio modes which can be changed via the appropriate button.</p><p>And, of course, you get an even more granular level of control over the lights and audio settings via the Edifier ConneX mobile app.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

When cellular connectivity drops during a disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">like it did on the Verizon network during Hurricane Helene in 2024</a>, it can impact people in need, first responder communications, and slow relief efforts. Roughly a year after the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, I got a firsthand look at how Verizon responds to tragedies nationwide and keeps cell service active.</p><p>There's a team within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> that you might not have heard of called Verizon Frontline. Its purpose isn't to sell you cell phone plans or offer you a trade-in deal, but rather to develop and deploy assets that can help first responders in emergency situations. It's a collaborative effort between government agencies and the Frontline team to share technologies first responders didn't know they needed, and create assets first responders think would be helpful.</p><p>That includes emerging technologies you might not expect to be useful during a disaster, such as AI, robotic dogs, drones, and more.</p><h2 id="new-problems-for-disaster-relief-2">New problems for disaster relief </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ" name="Verizon-Frontline-Truck-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is forcing emergency management departments and carrier teams like Verizon Frontline to adjust. Previously, there were narrower locations and seasons where you might expect disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, or tornadoes to strike. The situation is different now, with hurricanes striking in areas not prepared for them, and wildfire season in some areas of the U.S. becoming year-round.</p><p>This partly explains why Hurricane Helene was so devastating in states like North Carolina and Tennessee. In that instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">a major Verizon outage coincided with relief efforts</a> that appeared unrelated to the hurricane itself. These situations are where Verizon Frontline aims to fill the gap — this team within the carrier has over 600 mobile assets scattered nationwide that can sprout temporary networks and connectivity in an emergency.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U" name="Verizon-Frontline-Large-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One type of asset, called the Satellite Pico-cell on Trailer (SPOT), can be set up in roughly an hour and offers a few different ways of getting people online. The trailer supports multiple low-earth orbit satellite connectivity options, including Verizon's own satellites and Starlink. After the initial setup process, it can support up to 128 simultaneous users over Wi-Fi and also broadcasts cellular service over the Verizon network.</p><p>The small and versatile form factor of the SPOT allows it to be deployed almost anywhere and run for three days on its own power, thanks to a 30-gallon diesel fuel tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX" name="Verizon-Frontline-Small-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All the Verizon Frontline equipment I saw firsthand prioritizes redundancy, whether it's a small asset like the Rapid Response Connectivity Unit (RRCU) pictured above or a full-fledged trailer. The RRCU, despite being much smaller than the SPOT and quicker to deploy, can still broadcast Wi-Fi and cell signals in areas where traditional towers are unreachable.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">we covered Hurricane Helene</a>, we emphasized the importance of satellite connectivity. It's unsurprising that Verizon Frontline is trusting LEO satellite connectivity to power many of its assets, but the implementation is clever. Aside from the larger trailers, the company is also putting satellite internet dishes and receivers on things you wouldn't expect, like off-road vehicles and robot dogs.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Currently, I'm keeping an iPhone Air in my left pocket and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in my right pocket, and the latter has been my daily driver for months. Whatever your stance on thin-and-light smartphones is, a common criticism has been their pricing. It's hard to pay a premium when there are considerable compromises, but now you don't have to thanks to killer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales.</p><p>I paid for both my iPhone Air ($1,199) and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ($1,099) in full, and I regret to inform you that the Galaxy S25 Edge is now at a painfully-low price. My loss is your gain: you can snag a 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge for only $684.99, down from a full retail price of $1,099. To put that in perspective, the discount is over $400 and 38% off, and it's literally lower than the MSRP of a base-model Galaxy S25.</p><p>In other words, if you've been cautiously intrigued by thin phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge, this is your chance to snag one at a major discount with no strings attached — here's why you should.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>October Prime Day is LIVE - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-silver" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>$684.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central rating: ⭐⭐⭐</strong>⭐</a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the most versatile slim phone on the market today. It's the same exact screen size as the Galaxy S25 Plus, and still packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and two rear cameras. Despite bringing a lot of power, this phone still manages to be 5.8mm thin with a modest camera bump. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a thin phone that doesn't skimp on features; you need a 6.7-inch display and a premium build quality; you like Samsung's excellent One UI 7/8 software and Galaxy AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a phone with a big battery as your top priority; you'd rather own the thinnest phone possible with more compromises; you need a telephoto camera.</p><h2 id="all-the-ways-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-is-the-best-thin-phone-2">All the ways the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the best thin phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-1" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After using both, I'm <em>wowed</em> by the iPhone Air in a way the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge can't invoke. The bit of extra thinness, smaller form factor, and interesting camera plateau design makes the Air feel more exciting and different to me. However, I'm well aware that all of those reasons are also reasons why the average consumer probably shouldn't buy one.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> manages to get pretty thin at 5.8mm without feeling much different from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android smartphone</a>. It still has a premium AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the best Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and a dual-camera system on the back. In my performance and benchmark testing, I've found that the Galaxy S25 Edge is not only faster than the iPhone Air, but also handles thermal throttling and overheating better.</p><p>With One UI 7 out of the box (and upgradeable to One UI 8), the Galaxy S25 Edge isn't lacking in the software department. I won't tell you whether One UI 8 is better than iOS 26 — that's subjective, and Liquid Glass is controversial — but it's my favorite Android skin from Samsung and comes with seven years of guaranteed software updates.</p><p>The cameras are another separator. I think both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> and Galaxy S25 Edge have great main cameras, but Samsung's thin phone crucially adds an ultrawide lens. Just before I picked up my iPhone Air, I used the ultrawide lens on the Galaxy S25 Edge to take a wide shot at a concert, and realized just how important that secondary camera can be. While there's no telephoto on either, both have 2x "optical-quality" zoom, so Samsung's offering actually has 0.6x, 1x, and 2x options — superb for a slim device.</p><p>Overall, it's clear to me that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the more versatile device. At under $700 for a limited time during Prime Day, it's a no-brainer if you're even remotely excited by slim hardware. It's far less than I paid, and I'm quite happy with my purchase, so your deal will be even better.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-12">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's available in several different configurations, with this deal specifically being for the 12GB/128GB model in the Retro Power colorway.</p><p>That's part of what makes this deal so enticing, as AYANEO's Retro Power colorway is usually highly sought after and difficult to acquire. This has been a continuing trend for years, including the upcoming dual-screen AYANEO Pocket DS, which shares the same chip as the Pocket S.</p><p>Since reviewing the Pocket S, it remains a staple in my arsenal of Android gaming handhelds, as the premium design is genuinely enjoyable to use. If anything, my biggest complaint is that I wish the ergonomics were a bit better, but AYANEO does offer a grip case that alleviates some of those issues.</p><p>In the event that you <em>really </em>want handheld with better ergonomics and an OLED panel, the AYANEO Pocket EVO is also on sale. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHVKTJ3F/">8GB/128GB model is down to $429</a>, which is even less than what the Pocket S is going for.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The answer can be found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.ie/electronics/support/articles/00302454">Sony's own support forum</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>Well, the reason the PS5 doesn’t support Bluetooth Audio connections is because of possible latency performance and bandwidth. Bluetooth is a wonderful technology with an ever-increasing potential, but it currently comes with important limitations when gaming.</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>As your wireless controller connects through Bluetooth to the PS5, it already takes up Bluetooth bandwidth, and adding wireless audio might lead to minute audio delays, impacting your gaming experience. The same applies to Bluetooth speakers. That’s why gaming headsets such as the Sony INZONE models use a USB dongle (or are wired).</p></blockquote></div><p>As frustrating as it may sound, wired headphones aren't always an option. Not everyone has a pair, and not everyone is looking to buy one just to use with their gaming console. I found myself in this conundrum, wishing to use the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/four-months-with-the-marshall-kilburn-iii">Marshall Kilburn III</a> with the PS5.</p><p>Sony recommends Bluetooth adapters, and I was looking for a quick solution. That's when I came upon this excellent dongle from UGREEN. The price is too good to pass on, even without the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days discount.</p><p>The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is stupidly easy to set up and use. I was skeptic at first, I'm not going to lie, but the product worked just as smoothly as advertised. I highly recommend investing in one of these if you're in the same fix as I was.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sony quotes up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and I can also verify that I generally only have to charge the XM4 about once per week.</p><p>The sound quality delivered by the Sony XM4 is immersive and balanced too, as I have used these cans for everything from acoustic folk and death metal albums to staff meetings and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p><p>Sure, there are newer models to consider — and both the XM5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">XM6</a> might be better wireless headphones overall — but for me, the Sony WH-1000XM4 hit that sweet spot. If you can afford them, go with the newer generations of Sony headphones, but if you're looking to save some cash this Prime Day, this is easily my favorite headphones deal of them all.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days - Quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Deal hunters are skipping the smaller discounts and going for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 at $149.99</strong></a>, an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel, and you can bet stock will run out before Prime Day ends.</p><p>I've been covering Samsung deals for years, so I know that last year on Black Friday, the Galaxy Watch 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-hits-all-time-low-week-before-black-friday-2024">bottomed out at $149</a> before Samsung sold off its stock for good and pivoted to the Watch 7.

That doesn't mean you <em>should</em> buy it if you prefer a watch with weeks of battery life or a more Classic look, but be prepared to spend a lot more for it.</p><p>The fact is, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Watch 7</a> shows the two devices aren't that different, aside from Samsung's new "Cushion Design" that makes it skinnier and flatter against your wrist, but also throws away the normal circular look. Considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Watch 8 is $314 (10% off)</strong></a>, it's easy to argue that it's worth saving another $165 for the Watch 7 instead.</p><p>Truly, if you look at the other last-generation Android watches on sale today like the Pixel Watch 3 ($229) and OnePlus Watch 2 ($227), it's pretty amazing that the Galaxy Watch 7 is so much cheaper when it's arguably the best of the bunch. It's due to receive more software support, and its One UI Watch build has smooth software and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">best Tiles</a> of any Wear OS watch.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, three universally-loved BoboVR headstraps are on sale for Prime Day, with the classic style coming in at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>an incredible $39.99</strong></a> out the door. This sale ends October 8, 2025, so be sure to jump on the deal ASAP before it's gone!</p><p>BoboVR's headstraps are stupid comfortable and all come with a brilliant hot-swappable, magnetically detachable, rechargeable battery pack that'll add about 2 hours to your headset's playtime. Since you can hot-swap these, it's easy to grab a few additional batteries and lengthen your sessions, or just drop a battery on if you somehow forgot to keep your headset charged.</p><p>All three of these amazing headstraps <strong>will work on a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S</strong>. Here's how to choose between the three options this Prime Day:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm" name="bobovr-m3-pro-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The classic BoboVR headstrap design is also known as a "halo-style strap" and includes a plush forehead pad and angled, flexible plastic strap that wraps another plush cushion around your head. It's fully adjustable and can even be angled to fit any head shape or size, making it the best choice for most people.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: y</strong>ou hate the pressure VR headsets can put on your face. This headstrap design removes all the weight from your face and evenly distributes it around your forehead and the base of your skull, instead.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of active games or workout in VR. Since it doesn't pull the headset tightly onto your face, it can wobble a lot if you're flinging your head around constantly. If you just play "normal" VR games, this isn't a problem.</p><p><strong>🔋</strong><em><strong>Get even longer battery life </strong></em><strong>🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-B100-Replacement-Accessories-Connectors/dp/B0CWVC24M2" data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99"><del>$39.99</del> <strong>$31.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99">View Deal</a></p></div><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f80b50ce-f16e-4a4d-b876-8d843630c34b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$71.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSY8PD63" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="g7BkbNLh3EcQ9nUSFtxtL4" name="bobovr-s3-pro-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7BkbNLh3EcQ9nUSFtxtL4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Meta Quest gamers who find themselves dripping with sweat by the end of every VR session need to get the BoboVR S3 Pro. This headstrap uses the classic BoboVR halo-style strap design but improves it with a built-in fan to keep your face as cool as possible. Plus, the battery indicator light in the side arm will keep you from wondering how much juice is left.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you sweat a lot in VR. Seriously, there's nothing worse than that nastiness dripping down your face when you're just about to hit a high score or make the winning shot.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don't play long VR sessions or just want something cheaper.

This strap will keep the Quest 3 or 3S tight on your face and still includes a fantastic hot-swappable magnetic battery pack for extra-long play sessions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're not a fan of weight on your face. This is an "elite-style" strap that uses a horizontally-mounted headband to compress the headset tightly to your face.</p><p><strong>🔋</strong><em><strong>Get even longer battery life </strong></em><strong>🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-B100-Replacement-Accessories-Connectors/dp/B0CWVC24M2" data-dimension112="eba12354-a88b-477e-bfb3-78c909e05a49" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$63.99"><del>$39.99</del><strong> $31.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRFCW799" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="eba12354-a88b-477e-bfb3-78c909e05a49" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR B100 ultra-high capacity battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$63.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>I've been using BoboVR products for years and never hesitate to recommend them. If you're looking for an option that has hot-swappable batteries, there's simply no better choice. Each battery pack is 5,000 or 10,000mAh in capacity, which will double or quadruple your Meta Quest 3 or 3S's playtime, respectively.</p><p>Those battery packs are all recharged via a simple USB-C port, so any old phone charger you have lying around will work. Each headstrap type comes with one battery, but you can always order extra to keep the fun going for longer. Check the blocks for each product above, as I linked the correct battery for each headstrap type.</p><p>Remember that while the batteries might be model-specific, all three of these straps work for either the Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S, so you can game in comfort even if you opted for the more economical Quest 3S model!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But to get the best experience, you'll definitely want to grab a controller because touchscreen controls are just awful. As luck would have it, my favorite phone controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/"><strong>is down to $69.99</strong></a> for Amazon's Big Prime Day Deals, a discount of almost 50%.</p><p>What makes the ROG Tessen more unique than pretty much every other phone controller is how portable it is. This is because unlike the rest, the ROG Tessen can actually collapse and fold in half, making it great for throwing in your bag. But that's not the only reason why you should snag the Tessen for yourself.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension48="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ztdm9aX4GKYDr8tvEhxxsY" name="asus-rog-tessen-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ztdm9aX4GKYDr8tvEhxxsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ASUS ROG Tessen: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension48="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$129.99</del> <strong>$69.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>ASUS makes some of the best gaming hardware, and that includes the ROG Tessen.

ASUS might've been able to push things a little further, but seeing as the Tessen connects to your phone using USB-C, it just wasn't possible.</p><p>With that USB-C port, it not only ensures ultra-low latency for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>, but the ROG Tessen also allows for passthrough charging. The only "catch" is that you're limited to 18W charging speeds, which should be enough to keep your phone topped off, but temper expectations.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, a color TV show or movie was an obvious upgrade from black & white from a fundamental perspective, but the quality of early color content simply didn't match the contrast of black & white programming.</p><p>Things were made worse by a lack of standards and difficult-to-use equipment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/v04vgr/comment/iaee72x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One Reddit user</a> remembers having to "twiddle knobs to decide whether the people would be orange or green."</p><p>In a way, color e-readers can suffer from similar problems but for very different reasons. I've been using the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II as my main e-reader since the middle of August, and I've been extremely impressed with the unit. However, my older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review" target="_blank">Onyx Boox Page</a> still excels in a few areas that I didn't expect.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day is back - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="clarity-and-light-2">Clarity and light</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uSX22gLJPodvcSj8Fh5DeB" name="onyx-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-watermelon" alt="A colorful watermelon background on an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with some pink Cosmos in the foreground" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSX22gLJPodvcSj8Fh5DeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's be clear: The Boox Go Color 7 Gen II (I'll call it the Go Color from now on for simplicity) is a better all-around e-reader than the Onyx Boox Page. The design has been refined to feel more comfortable in the hand, and the OS features new capabilities enabled by the updated display.</p><p>But anyone coming from an older black-and-white e-reader will immediately notice the graininess of the new color display. Flat white backgrounds now have an almost "old film" quality, giving the picture a distinct character that isn't present on digital stock. The same feeling can't be said for reading, where this grain can be distracting for some.</p><p>Text on the black-and-white Boox Page looks smooth and clean. Even when viewed through a macro lens, the Page's letters appear to be printed ink. However, the color screen has a distinct digital pixel look to each character.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-white-background" alt="Comparing the screen quality of a white background between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-icons" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some people, this won't be a big deal.

Color E Ink is also dimmer in the sunlight, something that seems odd for an e-reader.</p><p>It still offers far better visibility than any LCD or OLED device available today, but it lacks the bright, white paper-like look and feel of the Boox Page.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WBn4YRH8Tj5Abb52K3ep49" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-sunlight-brightness" alt="Comparing the outdoor brightness visibility between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WBn4YRH8Tj5Abb52K3ep49.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>E Ink technology works by magnetically pulling positively and negatively charged black or white particles to the surface of the display.

On a color E Ink display, they're sorted into red, green, or blue-colored bins to create the illusion of a more solid color to the eye.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pz7N2VCLE6FQECzZRpQuy8" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-microscope" alt="Comparing letter structures under a microscope between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pz7N2VCLE6FQECzZRpQuy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because E Ink "pixels" can't be as small as those of an LCD or OLED, there's an obvious noise pattern that appears because you can still visibly see these red, green, and blue chambers with your naked eye.</p><p>Having pigments in separate chambers also means it's harder for light to scatter across the entire display. All these color chambers effectively create small divots in the display that trap light rather than help disperse it, unlike black-and-white E Ink. That makes a color E Ink panel appear darker.</p><h2 id="where-it-gets-good-2">Where it gets good</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tUhJbR49bZSKCPuCSMH9ye" name="onyx-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-manga" alt="Reading a color magna on an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUhJbR49bZSKCPuCSMH9ye.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The text clarity and brightness of the Go Color's E Ink display may be lower, but the refresh rate and color availability are substantial upgrades.

The quick toggles panel now includes four preset options for the frontlight, making it easy to adjust brightness and color with a single tap without having to adjust each individual slider.</p><p>The E Ink adjustment panel is now simplified into a button layout with an AI-powered "recommended" setting that does a remarkable job of further streamlining the process.

That's made up for by the addition of color and a substantially better refresh rate, making it more versatile.</p><p>I also love the design changes, from the new button layout to the rough paper-like feeling on the back. At 7 inches, it remains a Goldilocks size for an e-reader since it's about the size of the average novel and is more comfortable to hold long-term than having to fold back a spine. Overall, a fantastic choice for an e-reader upgrade, so long as you don't mind the less paper-like display.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbefb4e-c054-44de-9deb-eaccc59c4ce9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3dSym2GfCmLD7t3pS4XzS.jpg' alt="An official product render of an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a colorful sketch on the screen"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Color Go 7 Gen II</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>E Ink is already gorgeous, but when you add color to it, things get really impressive.

Instead, the brand waited seven long years to give a worthwhile successor with significant upgrades.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day is back - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="worth-the-wait-2">Worth the wait</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ScLqQGVDnyzdsgPqjAHvgn" name="marshall-kilburn-iii-lifestyle-1" alt="Marshall Kilburn III Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScLqQGVDnyzdsgPqjAHvgn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Details like the hefty rectangular design with faux leather upholstery, metal grill, and strap are unchanged for the most part.

Something about Marshall's tuning makes it perfect for background music, without taking away from the audio quality.

However, the tech specs, Auracast compatibility, battery life, and sound quality definitely justify the price. I can't see myself turning to any other speaker for my portable audio needs.</p><p>In fact, it's not just me — my entire friend group is madly in love with the Kilburn III. We don't go on road trips without it. It is an honorary member of the group at this point, and just as loved.

Your phone is optimized to do as much as it can while using as little power as possible, but it's still a very energy-hungry piece of electronics. We drain our battery so quickly because we use our phone excessively. If we use it less, we will have to charge it less.</p><p>Having said to horrible part out loud, there are things that can make a difference. For some of us, every tiny difference matters, so here's what you can do <em>without</em> putting your phone away.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-adaptive-brightness" alt="Enabling Adaptive Brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dim your screen:</strong> Most of us probably use some sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-even-dimmer-brightness-tile-spotted">adaptive brightness setting</a>, which can help, but I know at least a few of us have that display cranked up all the way all the time. That's a good way to tank your battery (and your eyes). The best approach would be to set it to a manual setting and adjust it to be as dim as possible, while still being readable. Second best? Use the adaptive brightness feature that came with your phone.</p><p><strong>Choose a short screen time-out:</strong> Your phone's display shuts off after a set period of inactivity. You can set this time yourself in your display settings. The shorter the better, but I'd advise at least 30 seconds or less. It's easy to unlock your screen when you need to see it.</p><p><strong>Disable Always-On Display (AOD): </strong>While convenient for checking the time and notifications, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-will-finally-bring-always-display-its-phones-year">Always-On Display</a> constantly uses a small amount of power. Turning this off is a simple way to save a significant amount of battery over the course of a day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7" name="airplane-mode.jpg" alt="Airplane mode toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Only use the wireless radios you need:</strong> There is no reason to leave Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or GPS on if you know you won't need them. All these use battery, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-quick-settings-your-notification-drawer-android-pie">easily toggle them on and off</a>.</p><p><strong>Turn off a poor connection:</strong> If you're somewhere with Wi-Fi and your network connection is poor, shut it down. Activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-use-airplane-mode-during-flights" target="_blank">Airplane mode</a> or turn off mobile data, then manually enable Wi-Fi. The cellular radio uses more energy than most people realize, and a poor connection consumes significantly more of it.</p><p><strong>Check your location settings:</strong> Your phone will scan for nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access points to assist in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-difference-between-precise-and-approximate-location-android-12">getting a more precise location</a>, and that can use some of your precious battery juice. Note that <strong>these scans occur even if Wi-Fi is turned off</strong>, unless your location settings are configured correctly. Yes, things aren't as accurate, but they're usually precise enough.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Check your apps: </strong>We all want the apps we use to be ready instantly, and that means that many of them work in the background, at least some of the time. That's fine if it's an app you actually use, but what about all that garbage that came with your phone that you'll never open? Uninstall them if possible, disable them if not, and if you're forced to leave them running, remember this the next time you choose which brand of phone to buy.</p><p><strong>Uninstall any apps you installed and never use:</strong> The same reason above applies here. Apps that came with your phone can usually do a lot more than ones you installed yourself, but those can still drain your battery. If you don't want it, trash it.</p><p><strong>Use your phone's battery management features:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">Your phone utilizes AI</a> to "learn" which apps you use most frequently and which ones are most critical to its functionality. These apps are left to do mostly their own thing, but the rest of them are throttled down to use a lot less battery. It really does work. While you're in there, be sure to set your phone to enter battery-saving mode when the percentage drops below a certain point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX" name="UGREEN-Uno-2-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-15W-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3299" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but these tips really won't make a huge difference. The best thing to do is find a phone that can do what you need it to do, as long as you need it to do so. Phones get better every year, and the battery life of a phone in 2025 is miles better than one from just a few years ago.</p><p>One last tip from me that many people overlook is the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a>. A wireless charger can charge your phone from zero to full, but it's best used another way: to maintain the charge. When my phone isn't in my hand or pocket, it's sitting on a wireless charger. Since making this adjustment, I can't remember a time when my phone died before I expected it—not counting the Pixel 4, because, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">if you had one, you know</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With a $100 price cut for Amazon Prime Day, however, it starts looking like an even more worthy pick, especially if you were looking to get something decent for under $350.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2GQTBQF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$449.85" data-dimension48="$449.85" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a decent mid-range phone with a long battery life, fast charging speeds and a good-looking display; you're looking for a good phone deal for under $350; camera quality is a major selling point for you when it comes to phones.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a phone with industry-leading performance; you prefer having a long-term software update promise; you need a phone with more than 256GB of storage.</p><p>Like many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> on the market, the Edge (2025) also includes the luxurious-feeling, vegan leather anti-slip back that users love, along with a vibrant 6.7-inch display.</p><p>This phone also comes with 256GB of storage and a wide range of AI features, super-fast charging speeds, and a reliable 5,200mAh battery. The 8GB of RAM straight out of the box also offers powerful multitasking performance for most. Beyond that, the Edge also boasts an ultrawide and macro lens, a telephoto, and a regular rear camera, as well as a powerful selfie camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fpsuHtSSt2LJWFWcmVarC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-lock-screen-01" alt="The lock screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 showing notification icons at the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fpsuHtSSt2LJWFWcmVarC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All in all, it's not a perfect device, but the price drop definitely helps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review">Motorola Edge</a>'s value proposition, which is normally a little unbalanced. Add in a lack of promised updates and mid-level performance, and it definitely seems worth taking advantage of the discount instead of paying full price.</p><p>We've named the Edge the best Motorola phone for a handful of reasons, primarily because of its battery life, charging speeds, camera suite, and the vibrant 6.7-inch pOLED display. Like other Moto models, the Edge also includes a really nice anti-slip vegan leather backing, which feels good to hold and offers a little extra grip.</p><p>The Edge's performance is backed by a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 processor and 8GB of RAM, while the display also offers a 120Hz refresh rate. Although it comes with Android 15 pre-loaded, arguably one of the biggest downsides of this phone is that it only comes with two years of OS updates, which can be a dealbreaker for some.</p><p>For others, however, a $100 discount might be the right time to pick it up, as we would normally consider it a bit on the expensive side for the specs it has to offer.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While a lot of the rage is about devices having OLED screens, you probably won't even notice that the Duet 11 is using a 2K LCD panel.</p><p>Powering the Duet 11 is the MediaTek Kompanio 838, which also makes this a powerful device that easily makes it last through the day. The Kompanio 838 is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, providing <em>enough</em> power for most tasks.</p><p>Considering that there aren't very many ChromeOS-powered tablets out there, your options are already limited. However, Lenovo continues to prove that it's dedicated to providing an excellent experience, regardless of what the rest of the market looks like. That trend continues with the Chromebook Duet 11, and frankly, this is probably the best Chromebook deal for most people.</p><p>While Amazon has the cheapest deal on the Duet 11, both Best Buy and Lenovo have also discounted the Chromebook. The only difference being that those retailers are offering the 4GB/128GB model for $250, while this Prime Big Day Deals discount is for the 4GB/64GB version.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

So many of them look nearly identical and all claim to be the best, but there's only one <em>real</em> best in town: Xreal One, and they're at their lowest price of all time with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1"><strong>this $130 off Prime Day deal</strong></a>! That makes them even cheaper than before tariffs jacked up the prices.</p><p>Xreal One has sat at the top of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> list since they debuted earlier this year, and it's for one big reason: they just work. That sounds really stupid for any tech product, but if you've ever used a pair of smart display glasses before, you'll know how frustrating many of them can be.</p><p>When you plug a pair of Xreal One glasses into a Steam Deck, smartphone, tablet, computer, PS5, or something else, you're immediately greeted with a giant virtual screen that stays in place like a proper monitor. That means you can comfortably move your head around and the monitor stays in place, just as if you mounted a physical monitor on an imaginary desk in front of you. No other pair does this, and it's why you should pick them over all the others!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ" name="xreal-one-glasses-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no turning back once you try Xreal One. These smart display glasses put a giant virtual monitor in front of you with full spatial tracking so you can move around without getting motion sickness. Plus, with tons of comfort options and excellent hardware design, you'll be wondering why you didn't pick up a pair sooner (but will be glad because they're <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449"><strong>$130 off now</strong></a>)!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you hate looking down at your laptop or portable gaming console and getting neck pain, you take long trips and need a "home away from home" desk, or you just need a way to focus on your work without distractions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a pair of smart glasses with a camera or AI functions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Ray-Ban-Glasses-Wayfarer-Frames/dp/B0CGXX2HG5/">Stick with Ray-Ban Meta</a> for that, instead.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><p>Personally, I love using Xreal One while traveling for work or pleasure. When you're on a plane trying to get work done, it's nothing short of harrowing attempting to work on your laptop on those tiny seatback trays. Not only are they stupidly cramped and will surely give you neck pain from having to look down, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/HardFactorPat/status/1232784648222187523">get your laptop crushed</a> by a reclining seat!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX" name="steam-deck-xreal-one-pro" alt="A Steam Deck and Xreal One Pro glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I use Xreal One with my laptop on a plane, I keep the laptop almost completely closed, leaving just enough room for my hands to type and use the touch pad. This not only keeps the laptop from damage, but using the glasses saves my neck since I can look <em>forward</em> instead of down. It also doubles as a privacy filter since no one around you can see what's on your smart glasses.</p><p>The same advantages hold true for when I'm gaming on my Steam Deck on a plane. No one can laugh at me while I constantly die in Elden Ring, and I can have a far more comfortable posture since I'm not holding my arms at a 90-degree vertical angle the entire flight. Plus, the eye-friendly DC-dimmed micro-OLED displays on Xreal One glasses give me the best picture possible, all without a headache. It's epic winning!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The bright, metallic hue debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and Pro Max, instantly standing out from Apple’s typically conservative “Pro” palette.</p><p>Unlike the subtle blues and grays of the past, Cosmic Orange feels loud but refined, a perfect middle ground between playful and premium. Apple switched to anodized aluminum for the new iPhone frames this year, which made richer and more vivid colors like this possible. And if early reactions are any indication, it’s a hit. Units in this new color reportedly sold out within hours.</p><p>The trend doesn’t stop with Apple fans. Dbrand has joined in, releasing its own Cosmic Orange skins that match Apple’s color. These skins are available for many devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra, as well as laptops, tablets, handheld consoles, and controllers.</p><h2 id="classic-dbrand-humor-serious-quality-2">Classic Dbrand humor, serious quality</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.32%;"><img id="QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F" name="Pixel-10-dbrand-skin" alt="Pixel 10 with Cosmic Orange skin from brand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1105" height="556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In true Dbrand fashion, the company didn’t hold back on the trolling either. “When Tim Cook hand-picked the new Cosmic Orange colorway, he had no idea we'd be ripping it off for a colormatched skin,” the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" target="_blank">wrote on its site</a>. “To be fair, we didn’t think it’d be popular enough to warrant a ripoff. Now that it has, we’re all too happy to turn your Android into a Temu iPhone.”</p><p>That mix of humor and confidence matches Dbrand’s usual style. But beyond the jokes, the company puts real effort into its products. The new skins are carefully color-matched and work with over 100 devices. Each one is laser-cut for a precise fit and starts at about $25, so you can add some orange to your tech without paying Apple prices.</p><p>If you already have an orange iPhone, this is a chance to coordinate your setup. Now you can match your laptop, console, or tablet with your phone for a seamless look.</p><p>No one knows if this orange trend will stick around after the next Apple event, but one thing is certain: the color’s appeal goes beyond branding. It’s about confidence, the kind that makes your phone, laptop, or controller feel a bit more personal.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fa3f1c77-8bea-4570-9cd5-49af4a3cdfba">            <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" data-model-name="dbrand Cosmic Orange skin" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7zmwoTWJ5hEGrMhXddDVo.jpg' alt="Cosmic Orange skin for Pixel 10"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">dbrand Cosmic Orange skin</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Apple’s bold Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro is already a hit, and now Android users can get in on the action too.

And don’t get me wrong, I test, play, and learn about all Android devices, but there has never been a good reason to fully convince me that I could switch from an iPhone to an Android and not feel like I’m experiencing an entirely different OS permanently.</p><p>This is coming from someone who’s used the OG OnePlus device, a Pixel 4, and the OG Motorola Razr.</p><p>I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> was the phone that Google finally got right. Not only did it seamlessly allow you to switch from an iPhone to an Android, but it took out all the guesswork once you made the switch.</p><p>I’m not one to push people to buy things, but if there’s one phone you should buy during this Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale event, it should be this phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ"><strong>is currently 32% off, originally priced at $1,099; now it’s $749</strong></a>, which is a great deal, especially if you want to take advantage of some of the best features on this phone.

Its triple rear camera delivers stunning detail with up to 20x Super Res Zoom, 8K Video Boost, and Night Sight Video. AI tools like Add Me, Best Take, and Magic Editor make every shot effortless, while Gemini helps you get answers, stay organized, and follow conversations naturally.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3031a8d7-6e7a-4ad9-9d05-07aa549cb5a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1099" data-dimension48="$1099" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="switching-over-has-never-been-this-easy-2">Switching over has never been this easy</h2><p>I’ve mentioned this before, but one of the biggest challenges that iPhone users have always faced is that the switchover can be challenging. It’s a whole new operating system, and if you’ve been used to one OS for years, it’ll be hard to convince you to switch over.</p><p>I think Google made this process incredibly easy. It literally took me 30 minutes to switch over, and not only that, but have the same layout on my home screen as I did on my iPhone. Every single app was already downloaded and ready to go, and I no longer had issues dealing with different chargers — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">iPhone now uses USB-C</a>.</p><p>For those who have an iPhone 15, I think this was the phone that really allowed this switch-over to take place incredibly quickly.</p><p>But not only that, I’ve said this before and I will say it again…the Google Pixel is the “iPhone” of the Android ecosystem. It is the phone that Google puts out as a “standard” for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to build on and do better. It is the base phone that the Android OS uses to test out new Gemini features, which then go to other Android devices.</p><p>Now, whether or not other devices want to create their own version of features that Android OS or Gemini has is up to them. But in my opinion, I believe Google is giving OEMs a reason to develop better products, and they have done that with advancing the Pixel device.</p><p>I think one of the most critical aspects of the Pixel 9 series is that Google set a standard for AI features that a phone needs to have. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google got it right with Gemini</a>, and the company has had several years to enhance it.</p><p>Anyway, all I can say is that the Pixel 9 Pro is a gorgeous phone. It is easy to use, you won’t miss the iPhone, and you’re getting some of the best AI features ever.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-17">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The $249 deal is for the tablet itself, which works like most tablets you've probably used. It's got a gorgeous 11-inch screen that's more eye-friendly than any Samsung OLED tablet on the market, plus battery life that'll last you days at a time.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet turns into a brilliant smart home controller and a Nest Hub-like display when you dock it, showing off all your recent photos from Google Photos in an elegant way. It's the best digital picture frame you'll find anywhere, but there's a slight catch to this functionality these days: Google no longer sells its expensive Pixel Tablet Speaker Dock.</p><p>Thankfully, you can still get hub mode working just fine with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Multi-Angle-Portable-Tablet-reader/dp/B01IJ5A0PC/?th=1">$8 tablet stand</a> and one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Anker-AirPods-Included/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/">these $11 chargers</a>.

Right now, buyers can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7K3TVTP" target="_blank"><strong>21% off on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</strong></a>, bringing the price tag down to just $760. The so-called "Fan Edition" of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 comes with the same physical build and form factor, but with slightly lowered specs and a cheaper price tag.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-review">Z Flip 7 FE</a> has a vibrant 6.7-inch internal screen with a 3.4-inch cover screen, both sporting vibrant AMOLED displays. While the FE model comes with a slightly less powerful Exynos CPU, slower charging, and a downgraded 10MP selfie cam, it still competes well with more budget-friendly competitors such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-vs-motorola-razr-2025">Motorola Razr</a>.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 256GB storage configuration of the flip phone, and it's available in both Black and White variants.

It has a good-looking 6.7-inch inner display, a 3.4-inch outer display, and a powerful suite of cameras featuring an ultrawide lens.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7K3TVTP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$959.99" data-dimension48="$959.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a good discount on the otherwise-expensive category of modern flip phones; you want a phone with a cover display that's highly functional and nice to use; you prefer having a phone with a long-term software update promise.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd rather upgrade to the non-FE edition of the Z Flip 7 for optimal performance levels with a more powerful CPU; you're not looking to spend over $750 on a phone; you need a phone with fast charging capabilities.</p><p>The past few years have brought with them a broader range of flip phone options, and today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">best flip phones </a>are worthy contenders among the larger market. While the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is one of our favorites, the FE offers a lighter spec load in the same packaging, ultimately giving it a lower price tag—even before this discount.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 FE has a lower-powered Exynos 2400 processor, and while the 10MP selfie camera is a little bit less capable, the rest of the cameras are still the same. Additionally, it still comes with the beautiful AMOLED 3.4-inch cover screen and 6.7-inch main screen, which boast 120Hz and 60Hz refresh rates, respectively.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 FE also gets 8GB of RAM for decent multitasking abilities, as well as a 4,000mAh battery and an IP48 water and dust resistance rating. While users do complain about the 25W wired charging being a bit too slow for the price point, this doesn't seem to be a dealbreaker for most.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-17">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links </h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of tapping letters, users literally rotate a dial to pick a character, let it go, and watch it snap back into place like a rotary phone.</p><p>Each of the nine dials represents a set of characters or commands, with sensors tracking rotation instead of the old pulse signals those phones once used. Even the “Return” key gets its own mini dial, because of course it does.</p><p>The new concept comes from Google Japan’s Gboard team, the same group responsible for a long-running streak of absurd but fascinating concept keyboards. Previous inventions have included a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-gboard-keyboard-in-japan">one-meter-long single-row keyboard</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJY5d14qKs" target="_blank">bendable keyboard</a> that wraps around objects.</p><h2 id="completely-open-source-2">Completely open-source</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.76%;"><img id="aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk" name="Gboard-dial-version-schematics" alt="Gboard dial version being designed on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1185" height="637" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Gboard Dial Version continues that experimental spirit but leans harder into open-source maker culture. Google isn’t selling it; instead, it released every bit of data — circuit board designs, CAD files, firmware, and assembly instructions — under the Apache 2.0 license on GitHub. That means anyone brave enough (and patient enough) can build their own rotary keyboard at home. For those less mechanically inclined, Google also provides plans for a simpler, single-dial version.</p><p>To picture how it works, think about dialing every letter you type. You put your finger in the right slot, turn to the character you want, and let go to select it. It’s definitely slow, but that’s intentional. The design encourages careful, hands-on input and helps prevent accidental key presses.</p><p>The design might even help reduce repetitive strain since it removes the constant finger-tapping motion of a traditional keyboard. It also features a charming mechanical feel, complete with the soft whirring sound of dials spinning back, offering a strangely satisfying, low-noise experience.</p><h2 id="more-fun-than-functional-2">More fun than functional</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34" name="Gboard-dial-version" alt="Gboard dial version with nine sets of dial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Japan clearly knows this thing isn’t practical for everyday work, but that’s not the goal. The Dial Version is equal parts joke, engineering challenge, and commentary on how we interact with digital input.</p><p>There’s even a nod to modern life — a small accessory stand doubles as a video call control: place your mouse on it to toggle your webcam or mic, just like “hanging up” an old telephone.</p><p>The company even experimented with a few design variants, from plain finishes to textured fabric covers that make it blend into home setups.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgdWyD0cBx4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> ]]></dc:content>

It seems the company is rolling out support for users in Arkansas. The publication states users can check to see if they have it by heading into Wallet > Add to Wallet > Driver's License/State ID.</p><p>For users in Arkansas, the process of adding your State ID to Google Wallet is just like all the others.</p><p>After selecting which state you're in, you'll be prompted to first snap a photo of the front and back of your ID. Then, you will have to record a quick selfie video of your face for verification purposes. You can send off everything required via the app, and you should soon receive confirmation that everything checks out, so long as all the steps were completed appropriately. This verification process shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and the alert will appear as any other on your device.</p><p>Accessing your digital State ID is a process similar to accessing your saved cards in Wallet.</p><p>Something that Google has warned in the past, same as the publication reiterates today, having your ID digital does not replace your physical version. This regards TSA and law enforcement more strictly, as they may still want to see your <em>actual </em>ID. Users should begin noticing Arkansas appear as an option in the Wallet app on their Android phones today.</p><h2 id="digitizing-cards-for-seamless-days-2">Digitizing cards for seamless days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX" name="Google-Wallet-student-id-hero.jpg" alt="College IDs sitting next to an Android phone with the Google Wallet app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working with U.S. States to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">incorporate digital IDs</a> into the lives of its users, and this work continued even through the end of 2024. Late last year, New Mexico joined an ever-growing list of states that support digital IDs in Google Wallet. It joined the likes of California, Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, and North Dakota.</p><p>The interesting thing about Google Wallet's current list of supported State IDs is that we were told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-brings-digital-id-support-to-uk-and-other-us-states">about Montana back in April</a>, the same as Arkansas. Those two states were listed alongside Puerto Rico and West Virginia; however, we're only seeing Arkansas today (Oct 6). Montana has since joined. So, it looks like Google is still working through any issues that may have arisen before users can see those promised states and territories in the app.</p><p>That announcement in April also highlighted digital ID support in the U.K., too. It's a more secure/safe way for residents there to confirm their identity. While passports were a part of this expansion for U.K. residents, Google said it's partnering with Rail Delivery Group to bring digital ID support to "select" Railcards in the U.K.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means if your phone’s set to English, lyrics from a Spanish or Korean track will be translated into English by default.</p><h2 id="limited-control-for-now-2">Limited control for now</h2><p>There’s no manual language picker yet, so if you want a different translation language, you’d need to change your device or app language entirely. It’s a small limitation, but one that makes sense for early testing.</p><p>For now, only select Premium users seem to have access to the feature, and Google hasn’t confirmed when (or if) it will reach everyone. This test appears to be part of a broader update focused on enhancing the lyrics experience, following YouTube Music’s previous rollout of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-live-lyrics-rolling-out-widely">real-time synced lyrics</a> and new visual layouts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.81%;"><img id="7VXicDX3TaHD3tkZv4kbT8" name="youtube-music-lyrics-translator" alt="real-time lyrics translator in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VXicDX3TaHD3tkZv4kbT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="387" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Diego on Telegram / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music’s translation system seems to use Google’s own machine translation tools, so quality may vary depending on the song and language. Like any automated translator, it might miss subtle nuances, idioms, or poetic wordplay, but it still offers a massive step forward for people exploring music beyond their native tongue.</p><p>This experiment also fits neatly into Google’s growing focus on AI-driven translation across its platforms. YouTube itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtubes-new-trick-automatically-re-dubs-any-video-into-your-native-tongue">recently expanded its auto-dubbing</a> and multi-language audio tools for creators, letting videos automatically generate dubbed versions in different languages.</p><p>Right now, there’s no timeline for a global rollout, and Google hasn’t shared details about supported languages or regions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, Android Auto 14.1 beta introduced support for full-fledged Android games like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2, Farm Heroes Saga, and Beach Buggy Racing. Unlike the HTML5-based GameSnacks, these are native apps that run more smoothly and can even go full screen, though you’ll still need to have them installed on your phone and, of course, be parked to play.</p><p>Some users may miss GameSnacks for its simplicity and fast loading, but this change signals a new direction for Android Auto.</p><p>With larger, more immersive games arriving on the platform, Google is working to make the in-car experience more modern and capable, even if it means letting go of the simple mini-games that helped pass the time while parked.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At this price point, it's hard to find many other competitors that even include ANC, let alone those from a brand-name like Samsung, whose products include a range of excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">phones</a>, tablets, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">laptops</a>.</p><p>These make it particularly easy to pair with other Samsung devices, though they'll also work with just about any other Bluetooth-capable device. They also include touch buttons for playback and volume control, as well as simple recovery modes for finding the devices when they're lost. The included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features also allow for live, real-time translation in some languages, while it's also easy to use the microphones for easy access to multiple voice assistant systems.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.03%;"><img id="MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1304" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$97.99</del> <strong>$54.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's FE Galaxy Buds are already amongst the company's more affordable earbud picks, but Amazon has recently brought the price down by 41% for Prime Day.

The so-called "Fan Edition" buds also come with built-in voice assistant access, real-time language translation features, and easy-to-use touch controls using the center platform on the earbuds. They also have SmartThings Find mode and Lost Mode for seeing their location on a map and sending a message to those who might find them, making them fairly easy to keep track of.</p><p>These earbuds are designed with a wing tip to help them stay in a user's ears more easily, and they also feature three silicone ear tip sizes in the package. While some users prefer a long, stalk earbud design or those that don't utilize an extra silicone ear tip, they look like a pretty decent pick for those who don't, and especially at this low price tag.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-22">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While the OnePlus 13 is undoubtedly better, it isn't twice as good; the difference between the two is mostly down to the auxiliary cameras. Basically, the OnePlus 13R is the much better value, and if you need a new phone and don't care about the wide-angle and tele lenses, it is the device to get.</p><p>That's doubly so now; the OnePlus 13R usually costs $599, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">now down to $499 on Amazon</a>, making it an even better value.

It has a similar design as the OnePlus 13, and the 120Hz OLED panel is among the best in this category. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 may not be the latest, but you'll hardly notice the difference while gaming — I didn't when I used the phone.</p><p>You also get a terrific 50MP camera at the back, and that's joined by a 50MP 2x lens. While it isn't as good as the OnePlus 13, it still does a decent job in most situations. In fact, the main camera is almost as good in all but low-light scenarios.</p><p>Then there's the battery; the 6,000mAh battery doesn't have silicon tech, but it is still the biggest battery in this segment, and it easily lasts a day and a half. In my use, I averaged two days between charges, and with 80W charging, it takes under an hour to fill up the massive battery.</p><p>All of this is my way of saying that if you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">new phone in the vicinity of $500</a>, there isn't anything better than the OnePlus 13R.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has slashed 41% off the 2TB Samsung T7 for October Prime Day</strong></a>, marking a great deal on an impressive amount of storage space.</p><p>This portable solid-state drive offers file transfer speeds of up to 1,050MB/s using the included USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. As such, the T7 not only includes tons of file space with the upgraded version offering 4TB of storage, but it's also fast enough for use cases like gaming, media editing, live recording and more. In particular, the T7 is well-liked for how incredibly small it is, easily letting users fit it into a pocket, backpack, purse, or other small bag. It measures just 72 grams and is just 8mm thick, making it a no-brainer as one of our favorite portable external storage devices.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE - see our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh" name="samsung t7 portable ssd square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung T7 Portable SSD (2TB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$187.99</del> <strong>$109.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>With Amazon Prime Day officially in action, the retailer has launched a huge, 41% discount on this 2TB Samsung T7 solid-state drive.

If you need more than 2TB, the model is also offered in a 4TB configuration, or you can save a little extra money by downgrading to the 1TB option.</p><p>While it comes with read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, it also offers write speeds of around 1,000MB/s, both of which are plenty fast for most users. Samsung also says this model is almost twice as fast as the previous-generation T5 model. It's suitable for use with PCs, phones, tablets and more, and it makes for a great storage companion when filming high-resolution video on a mobile device.</p><p>The T7 also comes in Titan Gray, Red, and Blue, but the biggest appeal to the unit is its tiny, portable design. It's just 72 grams, 8mm thick, 57mm wide, and 85mm long, making it a certified good pick as far as small SSDs go.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While I like the cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> and the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> proved to be the best overall foldable in my usage.

Yes, I get that it's still a lot of cash, but we don't usually see a 20% discount on Samsung's latest phones, and that's what makes this deal that much more enticing.

I'm using the blue model, and it looks exquisite. Of course, the thinner design combined with a lighter chassis makes it significantly easier to hold and use. At just 4.2mm when unfolded, it is thinner than just about every other foldable, and even when you fold it, the 8.9mm thickness is in line with most regular phones.</p><p>Both the inner and outer AMOLED panels have magnificent colors and contrast levels, and the foldable gets a new 200MP camera that's astonishingly good. The 4,400mAh battery manages to last all day, and I didn't see any issues in this area.</p><p>Then there's the software; Samsung's One UI 8 is right up there as one of the best software skins on Android, and this is doubly true when talking about foldables. Samsung did all the right things with the software, and you get to maximize the real estate of the inner 8.0-inch panel.</p><p>Ultimately, savings on $400 is nothing to scoff at — particularly on a new device like the Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you're ready to make the switch to a foldable, you'll should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL">Galaxy Z Fold 7 while it's still available for $1,599</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, I was impressed by the smartwatch's seemingly endless battery life that refused to drain weeks in. Now that the watch is a few years old, we've seen a decent price drop. In my eyes, this makes it an even more worthy buy in 2025.</p><p>Two years on, I still use the Amazfit Balance every other day. It covers all the basics and performs smoothly until today, and the battery has not degraded either. I get to track all my health and fitness metrics, there's onboard storage for music, and there are plenty of other useful features like the ability to respond to texts.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance launched in September 2023 at a neat $199.99 price tag. You can currently buy the Balance smartwatch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M/"><strong>$149.99 at Amazon</strong></a> or other retailers. And with Amazon's October Prime Day on the horizon, you could probably score an even sweeter deal on this Amazfit wearable. Compared to the newer Amazfit Balance 2 that costs an insane $299.99, I still recommend the original Balance model if you're on a tight budget. This smartwatch was so well-rounded that I continue to recommend it as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches#section-best-starter-option">best starter option when looking at top Amazfit smartwatches</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="It might be two years old, but this toddler is still going strong and definitely worth your attention.

There's local storage if you want to store music on the watch and connect a pair of wireless headphones or earbuds with it. There's even NFC for contactless payments.</p><p>The 46mm case doesn't even feel like it's there, because the watch is so lightweight.

I like to log my walks and runs so I can view the route I took later. It's a great way to plan and track your activities. And with AI features like Zepp Flow and Zepp Coach, you can harness the power of AI to reach your fitness goals.</p><p>Amazfit introduced the full-sized QWERTY keyboard to reply to text messages on the Amazfit Balance. Back when I first tested the watch, it was a little janky. But now, this feature works much better than before.</p><p>This is a fantastic smartwatch overall, ideal for newbies in the wearable space who still want some extras but can't commit to Wear OS just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, released in September 2025, are the same AI glasses everyone knows and loves, now with longer battery life, improved camera quality, and more styles to choose from.</p><p>But the newest kid on the block, Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, does exactly what it says on the tin. Instead of being purely audio-only, like the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, the newer Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature a nifty display in the right lens that works much like a smartwatch. They're also more than twice the price of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, so while they feel like the future on your face, there's a price to pay to get there.</p><p>So, do you need the most expensive pair of smart glasses Meta offers, or would it make more sense for you to save some money and opt for the tried-and-true AI glasses?

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 is entirely reliant on voice interaction for nearly all of its functions, but it features a physical camera shutter button on the top of the right arm, as well as a touchpad on the right arm that can be used to adjust volume, play or pause music, and more.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature these same inputs in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a neural band</a> that's used to detect gestures made with your hands. The cloth band fits comfortably on the wrist you'll primarily use to interact with the glasses' menus and can understand your movements via electrical impulses in your wrist muscles.</p><p>This allows Meta to open up an entire operating system's worth of functionality for Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, including the ability to perform tasks like zooming in with the glasses' camera without needing to touch your glasses or use your voice. You can even reply to messages by "writing" on a table with your hand, or perform fun actions like pinching and rotating your fingers to adjust volume or zoom in and out of the camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses falls somewhere between a smartwatch and a smartphone, offering numerous ways to perform everyday tasks that are too cumbersome for a smaller smartwatch display. Since it's on your face, Meta says it allows you to be more present with people in the room, rather than looking down at your watch or phone to check notifications or messages.</p><p>The display in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses enables visual use of Meta AI in a way that's not possible with the audio-only Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s. While both types of glasses can perform many similar functions — such as taking photos or videos, providing live translation, playing music through the speakers, or using AI to identify objects in front of you — the addition of a display enables far more interactive elements.</p><p>The display on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses features a convenient accessibility feature called Live Captions, which utilizes the camera and AI to identify the people you're talking to, then displays closed captions on the glasses' display. Since no one can see the display from the outside, these captions are entirely private to you and can be great for noisy environments or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses also have a visual viewfinder for the cameras, while Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 users will have to just click the button and hope the picture is lined up right. Ironically, though, Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 has a more capable camera that can record at up to 3K resolution or at 1080p/60FPS. That's an upgrade over the 1080p/30FPS camera in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><h2 id="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-gen-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2): Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Content creators will likely want to choose the smoother or higher-resolution video on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s, as the first-person perspective and ultrawide angle are able to capture everything in front of you without an issue.
