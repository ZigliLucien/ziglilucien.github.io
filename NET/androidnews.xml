Filed in a New York federal court this week, Google’s lawsuit claims BadBox 2.0 infected uncertified devices—like budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming boxes</a>, tablets, and projectors—by either slipping in malware before they shipped or sneaking it in through shady apps on open-source Android systems.</p><p>The infected devices were then used to carry out widespread ad fraud and other cybercrimes. On the bright side, Google’s Ad Traffic Quality team has upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Play Protect</a> to automatically shut down any apps tied to BadBox 2.0.</p><p>Google’s lawsuit points to specific infected devices, including Android TV boxes like the X88 Pro 10, T95, MXQ Pro, and QPLOVE Q9. Human Security has shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/" target="_blank">longer list</a> for those curious.</p><h2 id="is-your-device-on-the-list-2">Is your device on the list?</h2><p>If you’re using one of those flagged devices, it’s a good idea to disconnect it immediately. According to Google, the BadBox malware hides in the background and silently fakes ad clicks without tipping you off.</p><p>The FBI has put out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605" target="_blank">public warning</a> about the scope of this threat, saying hackers are using compromised TV streamers, projectors, car infotainment systems, and even digital photo frames to break into home networks. Most of these infected devices, the agency notes, were made in China.</p><p>Hackers are slipping into home networks in two main ways: by loading malware onto devices before they’re even sold, or by sneaking it in during setup through shady apps with hidden backdoors. When these infected IoT devices go online, they can be roped into the BadBox 2.0 botnet or used as residential proxies, both of which are often tied to sketchy online activity.</p><p>Ad fraud seems to be a major issue for Google here. The company says it's stuck footing the bill for fake ad traffic while also pouring time and resources into tracking and shutting down the botnet. On top of that, Google claims the whole thing chips away at user trust, hurts its reputation, and cuts into profits.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This marks a big shift from previous trends.</p><h2 id="flip-s-long-reign-ends-2">Flip’s long reign ends</h2><p>Last year, it was the Flip 6 leading with 60%, while the Fold 6 sat at 40%. The year before that, the Flip 5 dominated with 70%, and the Fold 5 managed just 30%. So, it's clear that the numbers highlight a major turnaround in foldable buyer preferences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UTfEPdivn5Jx9qHGGgXvcf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-fold-6-fold-5-fold-4-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs Fold 6, Fold 5, Fold 4, top-down view angled closer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTfEPdivn5Jx9qHGGgXvcf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4732" height="2662" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, these numbers are just from Korea, but don't be surprised if the Fold 7 starts stealing the Flip's spotlight globally too. Samsung packed this year's Fold with enough upgrades to actually make people reconsider their usual Flip habit.</p><p>This Z Flip trend has made sense until now. The Z Fold lineup has always been nearly twice the price of the clamshell foldable. Plus, Samsung’s book-style foldables used to lag behind some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">leading foldables</a> from China in design innovation.</p><p>Still, the Z Fold 7’s current momentum isn’t all that surprising. It’s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-early-battery-impressions">big step up from the Fold 6</a>, seeing as it is noticeably thinner, lighter, and now the lightest book-style foldable out there. It’s also one of the slimmest foldables overall, and that major design overhaul is likely a big reason why more people are picking it up.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="789745c1-67d8-476e-9b83-341f4b10d184">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>For first-timers or longtime Fold users looking to upgrade, the Z Fold 7 stands out as Samsung’s strongest foldable yet in the U.S. That said, if you’ve already dropped cash on a large-screen foldable not too long ago, the $2,000 asking price might be hard to justify.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

That is, on their own. While I was thoroughly impressed by what the Buds 4 were able to offer at their price point, I couldn't help but think about the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 during my review period.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> are my go-to recommendation for value-first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds for Android</a>, and they currently cost about $150. When the OnePlus Buds 4 are at full price, they retail for $130. That isn't a lot of breathing room for OnePlus' new mid-tier earbuds.</p><p>At launch (and at the time of writing), you can use code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> to save $30 on the Buds 4 on the company's website, temporarily helping matters. With a price difference of about $50 between models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> and Buds Pro 3 can coexist. But when this deal expires, OnePlus has a problem.</p><p>At full price, I'd recommend everyone but those on the tightest of budgets spend an extra $20 on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, skipping the Buds 4. Here's why.</p><h2 id="all-the-hardware-differences-between-the-oneplus-buds-4-and-the-buds-pro-3-2">All the hardware differences between the OnePlus Buds 4 and the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-5" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 next to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a record stand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the OnePlus Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 on paper, there are a boatload of similarities. Both pairs of truly wireless earbuds use drivers with an 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter. They also each have dual digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and support the same AAC, SBC, and LDAC codecs. It's possible the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 even use similar or the exact same drivers, but I can't know for sure.</p><p>A key difference between the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 is their frequency response, and this will be important later. The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 can reproduce sounds between 10Hz and 40KHz, whereas the Buds 4 are a bit more limited, with a frequency response of 15Hz and 40KHz. In other words, the "Pro" earbuds can physically recreate more sounds accurately than the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-1" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 cases next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 have a more premium feel, with a faux leather case that I think makes them look better than any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market. Some might find OnePlus' faux leather looks to be tacky, and I can understand that. If you're deep in the ecosystem with a leather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, it can create a neat and cohesive experience.</p><p>They support wireless charging, which is a big omission by the OnePlus Buds 4. Overall, the OnePlus Buds 4 still look more like their Nord budget counterparts than a "Pro" pair of earbuds. They have a thicker, rectangular stem that lacks squeeze controls. Additionally, both the case and earbuds have a matte finish.</p><h2 id="how-the-oneplus-buds-4-sound-compared-to-the-buds-pro-3-2">How the OnePlus Buds 4 sound compared to the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-3" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 compared with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With similar audio drivers and noise-canceling hardware, it's no surprise that the OnePlus Buds 4 sound very close in quality to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Volume seems consistent against both pairs of earbuds, and they also have a strong bass representation. For some, this will be enough to make the OnePlus Buds 4 a viable alternative to the Buds Pro 3 — if you like loud, bass-heavy music, these will do the job.</p><p>Where the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 outshine the Buds 4 is in soundstage separation, clarity, and range. I mentioned the Buds Pro 3's expanded frequency response earlier, and I think you can really make it out this difference in casual listening. The low end is a bit fuller and doesn't encroach as much on the midrange space, whereas the OnePlus Buds 4 will give you similar sounds with less separation.</p><p>On top of that, the high end is way more pronounced, making it easy to enjoy the crisp sound of hitting a snare drum or cymbal separately from the rest of the instruments on the soundstage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-6" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is OnePlus Buds Pro 3 sounding slightly more polished than the Buds 4. Both are an excellent listen, and frankly, I'm impressed that the OnePlus Buds 4 got as close as they did to the Buds Pro 3 at their price point. Still, I can't help but feel like the Buds 4 can have bass that's <em>too</em> overwhelming.</p><p>Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling quality</a> is solid across both the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 and Buds 4. With three microphones per side on the Buds 4 and a real-time ANC algorithm, they should successfully block out unwanted noise while listening to music.</p><p>Both pairs of earbuds will get around four to six hours of battery life on their own, depending on your volume and whether ANC is on or off.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-nail-the-intangibles-while-the-buds-4-cut-corners-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 nail the intangibles, while the Buds 4 cut corners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-7" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although I prefer the sound of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, the difference is probably negligible for most listeners. Where the higher-end pair pulls away from the cheaper version is in their design. The Buds Pro 3 are more compact and feature a cylindrical stem, and they're much more comfortable than the blocky stem on the Buds 4. I get a better fit and, thus, a more enjoyable experience listening to the Buds Pro 3.</p><p>The Buds Pro 3 also have better on-earbud controls than the Buds 4, at least by my standards. You squeeze the stems on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to adjust playback or ANC modes, and swipe up or down on the front of them to raise or lower the volume.</p><p>These are more reliable and intuitive than the swipe and tap controls on the flat portion of the OnePlus Buds 4 stem. Rather than incorporate a squeeze function, the Buds 4 only use capacitive buttons with no tactile feedback.</p><p>Sometimes they're too sensitive, changing something while you're actually trying to adjust the fit of your earbuds. Other times, you have to push the side of the earbud stem hard to change the ANC mode, shoving the earbud uncomfortably in your ear.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-are-still-the-better-value-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the better value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-4" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on top of a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus upgraded the sound quality, ANC, and charging case for the Buds 4, but it may have pushed the earbuds too close to its standout Buds Pro 3. I can't imagine why you'd want to buy the Buds 4 over the Buds Pro 3 unless you can get a great deal. At their full price, I'd gladly pay an extra $20 for the Buds Pro 3, which have settled into a typical $150 price point about a year after their release.</p><p>You get a crisper and more diversified sound, a wider soundstage, better controls, and wireless charging just by going with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. This part is a bit subjective, but I think you get a more stylish and comfortable design, too.</p><p>Originally, it was unclear where the new OnePlus Buds 4 landed in quality compared to the Buds 3 and Buds Pro 3. It looked like the Buds 4 might have the chops to beat or match the Buds Pro 3 on paper. But after spending a few weeks with both pairs of earbuds, it's clear that the Buds Pro 3 still have a clear edge. Unless you can snag the Buds 4 for $100 or less, the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the best value in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless Android earbuds</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c1162bc-cffb-4a99-adbd-5dfef51635ca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwVEiC32nwm2QHvnHgrch8.jpg' alt="The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the best</strong></em></p><p>The Buds Pro 3 are still the best OnePlus earbuds you can buy, even if the similar Buds 4 made things a bit confusing.

Before the Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumor mill started ramping up, I had hope that Samsung would make things better than the last three iterations.</p><p>Needless to say, those hopes were quickly dashed as soon as we caught wind of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Fold Special Edition</a>. It too shared the same measly 4,400mAh battery that Samsung seemingly has a surplus of, or just refuses to let go of. As such, that's exactly what we've got here in the Fold 7.</p><p>Fortunately, just like the ones that came before it, battery life has been pretty solid. However, I don't suspect that to be the case for long.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-solid-for-now-2">Battery life is solid... for now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before I get too far ahead of myself here, let's talk about how things have been going so far.

Here's how everything played out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Screen</p></th><th  ><p>Time Starting</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage</p></th><th  ><p>Difference</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover</p></td><td  ><p>12:13</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>1:13</p></td><td  ><p>62%</p></td><td  ><p>~15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Main</p></td><td  ><p>2:34</p></td><td  ><p>42%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>3:34</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td><td  ><p>~29%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It shouldn't be too surprising that the battery drained more when performing the test from the larger main display. There are simply more pixels to power, but I did double-check my math, because I didn't expect the Fold 7 to drain twice as fast. Then again, besides being larger, the main screen also has a 2184 x 1968 resolution, compared to the 2520 x 1080 resolution of the cover display.</p><p>Although I doubt many will be watching videos under these specific circumstances, it doesn't bode well for the Fold 7's battery longevity. I'm not really surprised or disappointed in what I've seen so far, as it's just what I expected, even with the efficiency gains provided by the new chip.</p><p>Which brings me back to my concerns with Samsung opting for the 4,400mAh for another year. I think there's probably a prototype somewhere in the labs that has the same screen sizes as the Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">S Pen support</a>, flagship-level cameras, and at least a 5,000mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC" name="honor-magic-v5-side-profile-closed-render" alt="Side profile view of the Honor Magic V5 closed, showing how thin it is" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3017" height="1697" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why not just throw caution to the wind and release the ultimate foldable? Because the mass market dictates otherwise. There's currently a race to release the thinnest foldable possible, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-than-honors-magic-v5-test-claim-report">there seems to be a debate</a> about whether the Magic V5 holds the title or if it now belongs to Samsung. No matter who the current claim-holder actually is, these phones are razor-thin and incredible feats of technology.</p><p>But when you consider that the Magic V5 has a battery capacity that's almost 40% larger than the Fold 7, I can't help but wonder why. A lot of that has to do with much of Samsung's competition beginning to integrate "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon</a>" batteries, which support faster charging and are said to be more efficient. Samsung continues to rely on a more traditional dual-cell lithium-ion battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6034" height="2586" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think Samsung probably took a look at where the market was trending and then used the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition as a "testing" device. Since it had a positive reception, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone makers</a> were focusing on getting thinner, that's the route that Samsung took.</p><p>As for why Samsung didn't take the leap into using a different battery technology, I don't know. There's probably a well-constructed and semi-logical answer that Samsung would give. But I'm more of the mindset that the company will do whatever it takes to avoid another Note 7 scenario, despite it being almost ten years later.</p><h2 id="the-short-term-future-looks-bleak-2">The short-term future looks bleak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-cases-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've made it this far without talking about wireless charging, and that's simply because I haven't been using wireless charging.

And frankly, while I own non-magnetic wireless chargers, I haven't dug one out yet for testing.</p><p>Ultimately, what makes me so disappointed with this decision has nothing to do with my <em>current</em> experiences with the Fold 7. It's all about 3 months, 6 months, or one year from now. The battery will degrade; it's just science, and it happens with every phone.

The Astra is a mid-range tablet with a stylish design that's in line with the brand's phones, and it runs the latest Qualcomm silicon alongside an 8,200mAh battery.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the Astra comes with an OLED panel. Most Android tablets continue to use an LCD panel, and you just don't get the rich contrast levels and vibrancy that an OLED delivers, so the fact that Redmagic went with OLED is enough to distinguish the Astra from its rivals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TKGggzhzAKUZ8KLNtNZhGF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKGggzhzAKUZ8KLNtNZhGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the value; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.redmagic.gg/products/redmagic-astra-gaming-tablet?variant=54565184766025">Astra starts at just $499 on Redmagic's site,</a> and that's ridiculous when you consider the hardware it's packing. The same tablet is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Astra-Gaming-Tablet-Eclipse/dp/B0F9L522JZ">listed on Amazon for $699</a>, so it's clear that Redmagic is incentivizing the launch with a decent discount on its site.

The OLED panel has outstanding color vibrancy and contrast, and it's a definite point of differentiation. You also get LTPO tech and 5,280Hz PWM dimming, and it gets bright enough that I didn't notice any issues even under sunlight. It's not a tandem OLED panel like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, but it is better than any other Android tablet I used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gaming on the Astra is a real delight, and the tablet handles demanding titles without breaking a sweat. It uses an active cooling solution (a small fan that's located at the back) alongside an innovative thermal management system, and the result is that it doesn't throttle even under load. It tends to overheat at times, but it isn't anywhere as uncomfortable as a gaming phone thanks to the larger surface area, and this was only an issue while running 3DMark's stress tests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is the most affordable way to get your hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the U.S., and the gaming tablet lives up to its potential.

The onboard sound gets loud and detailed, and there's a Magic Key on the side that's customizable. The tablet gets a fingerprint reader along with face unlock, and it's fast to authenticate. The vibration motor is pretty good too, and it has decent feedback.</p><p>Thanks to an 8,200mAh battery, the Astra easily lasts a few days with regular use, and it delivers nearly eight hours of gaming. It takes just over 80 minutes to charge the device thanks to 80W charging, but there isn't a charger included in the package.</p><h2 id="software-that-you-actually-want-to-use-2">Software that you actually want to use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tablet runs Redmagic OS 10.5 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the software has good fluidity and not much in the way of overt styling. There's enough customizability should you need it, and I like that Redmagic cleaned up its interface in the last 18 months. There isn't any unnecessary AI bloat either, with Redmagic instead teaming up with Google to deliver Gemini and real-time translation and editing utilities.</p><p>The only issue is that the Astra will get just two software updates, and that limits its long-term usability. The hardware should easily last a half-decade at least without any noticeable slowdowns, and Redmagic really needs to do better. Other than that, the only other omission is 5G connectivity — the Astra doesn't get any cellular modem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Mf8ziuLu7MgNEYeiiCQUDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mf8ziuLu7MgNEYeiiCQUDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Astra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-gaming-tablets">best Android gaming tablet</a> available today.

The big-screen foldable is thinner and lighter while being more powerful, with a flagship processor and main camera. It helps Samsung pull ahead of Google in the foldable race — at least for now. While it looks like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 tops the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google will have the chance to respond with the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google recently set a launch event for Aug. 20, so the official Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveal isn't too far away. Rumors and leaks don't point to Google overhauling its next foldable to the extent Samsung just did. Still, that doesn't mean the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't be a better foldable for some people. Let's review how the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will compare to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, based on the latest speculative information available.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-in-hand-back" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5326" height="2996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event</a> penciled in for Aug. 20, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> is nearing an official launch. It'll likely be revealed on that date alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. The phone could be made available for pre-order that same day, with general availability beginning Aug. 28. However, it's worth noting that Google took some extra time releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> last year, so its successor may debut after the rest of the lineup.</p><p>Pricing for the new foldable is up in the air, with earlier rumors suggesting Google could shave hundreds off the sticker price. More recently, there's talk of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold keeping its $1,799 price tag. Either way, the phone will likely cost less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">you can purchase now for $1,999</a>. That gets you the base model with 256GB of memory and 12GB of RAM, and it's generally available as of July 25, 2025.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be available in two colors, Moonstone and Jade. Samsung offers the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, and Jetblack. There's also a Mint colorway exclusive to Samsung's online store.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-design-and-displays-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Design and displays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-top-bottom" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which shows off its full internal display and rear camera housing, which hosts three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike Samsung, Google is reportedly planning to keep things mostly the same on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. It'll likely have the same general form factor, an identically-sized main display, and similar dimensions compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This is reflected in leaked product renders for the device, created based on rumors and leaks. Of course, things can change, but we're not expecting many surprises when it comes to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's design.</p><p>There are a few key upgrades to point out. The cover screen may grow slightly to 6.4 inches, with the hinge assembly and bezels possibly shrinking to accommodate the larger display. It'll still be an AMOLED display panel supporting 120Hz refresh rates, but the screen's brightness capabilities will be upped to reach 3,000 nits, according to leaks. Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the first foldable IP68-certified against dust and water ingress.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-waterproof">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 does have an IP48 rating</a> for dust and water-resistance, it doesn't have the highest level of dust protection like the Pixel might.

It'll be an AMOLED panel capable of variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz and 2,700 nits of peak brightness, at least. The inner screen could come with a brightness increase to match the outer screen, but that's not confirmed.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 also has an 8-inch AMOLED screen, although the aspect ratio is closer to square than the Pixel. It supports 120Hz variable refresh rates and has a lower 2,600-nit peak brightness rating. Still, both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold will almost certainly have stunning displays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Galaxy AI image generation hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless Google pulls off a miracle, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Samsung made its latest foldable just 8.9mm thick when folded, and it weighs only 215 grams. By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to measure somewhere around 10.5mm thick when folded and weigh roughly 257 grams. Those figures are based on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold dimensions, and current rumors and leaks don't point to major changes.</p><p>On one hand, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was already pretty thin, so the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't feel insanely thick. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is likely to be over a millimeter thinner than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and that difference is hard to ignore.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's possible the biggest Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold upgrade is on the inside.

The company is also reportedly switching to more custom components as part of the move, and this could come with efficiency improvements.</p><p>Regardless, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be more powerful. It is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the best-in-class processor for Android phones.

Paired with a more efficient Tensor G5 platform, this could combine to make for impressive battery life gains. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400mAh battery — but it does have faster wired charging speeds.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't expected to come with any camera hardware upgrades. That would give buyers a 48MP main sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens capable of 5x optical zoom. Meanwhile, Samsung swapped the Galaxy Z Fold 7's main camera sensor for a new 200MP lens this year. It also sports a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Both phones are rumored to have 10MP front-facing cameras on both the main and cover screens.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-should-you-buy-now-or-wait-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Should you buy now or wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When considering a new foldable for 2025 and beyond, it's worth remembering that Google and Samsung aren't in sync. While Samsung just gave the Galaxy Z Fold a major overhaul this year, Google's big revamp to the Pixel Fold occurred last year. The jump from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is equivalent to the leap from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. As such, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't be a major upgrade, but that was expected.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will likely be the better device on paper, as it packs a more powerful chipset and a better main camera sensor. Additionally, it's thinner and lighter, and some would say Samsung's foldable build quality is better than Google's. The price tag starting at $2,000 means that, at the very least, there will be $200 of separation between Samsung and Google foldables.</p><p>If you're looking for a great foldable that doesn't cost you a fortune, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be the better option. It would also have the advantages of running Pixel UI, featuring a more inviting design language, and a wider display aspect ratio. Even with that in mind, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will win on the spec sheet every time.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6a75c679-08f2-461c-9640-fb43d324cecb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg' alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An iterative upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the major leap the Galaxy Z Fold 7 was, but that's in part because its predecessor was already an outstanding device.

They always say "pending regulatory approval," but what does that really mean?</strong></em></p><p>Hi Roger, and thanks for writing in and asking! Since so many people use a wearable device for health and fitness, this is an interesting and important question.</p><p>The easy answer is that manufacturers mean what they say — they do not have approval to sell a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable</a> with a specific feature (hypothetically, say, sleep apnea detection) in all countries, so it's launching in those countries without that ability.</p><p>Often, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">approval is granted</a> and the feature comes with a software update, but not always. It's easy to blame the manufacturers; Samsung or Google should do whatever is needed to get those features out for everyone. But it's not really up to them.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-is-already-there-2">The hardware is already there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Companies usually don't make a different version of the product for different countries. If you buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> in France and it can monitor your breathing during sleep, it could also do it in the United States as far as the hardware is concerned. Sometimes, even the software is there, buried and hidden, because it can't be used. But usually it's not.</p><p>We see phones built differently for different parts of the world, but wearables are a more integrated platform with more stringent hardware requirements, so it's best to just make them all the same. Your watch has the same chips and sensors inside as one sold anywhere else, even if the features are slightly different.</p><h2 id="blame-the-government-2">Blame the government</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-us-fda.jpg" alt="Samsung announced it has gained U.S. FDA approval for its sleep apnea detection." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm sure every country around the world has some sort of regulatory body that governs the use of medical devices intended to be worn or implanted. Yes, if your wearable tries to detect or diagnose a specific health condition, it is considered a medical device. I'm only really familiar with how it works in the U.S., but I imagine the process is similar everywhere else.</p><p>In the U.S., if you build your own medical device, write your own software, and use it <em>yourself</em>, you do not need any sort of approval from anyone. Nobody is doing this, of course, but the provision is there because it needs to be — someone needs to test things during the product development stage.</p><p>Once you make your device or software available for others, and <em>especially</em> if you put it up for sale, you need to jump through all sorts of hoops. For health features, this means the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) decides.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/wearables-fda-and-patient-advice-what-physicians-should-know" target="_blank">FDA says</a> that any device “<em>intended for use in the diagnosis of disease of other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</em>” requires FDA approval. Wearable devices are not regulated if they are intended only for general wellness uses. <strong>All</strong> implanted devices require approval.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung just went through this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-sleep-apnea-galaxy-watch-more-users-globally">sleep apnea detection</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch</a> last fall. Originally, it was sold in the U.S. without access to this feature because — you guessed it — it required regulatory approval.</p><p>The FDA determines if the feature is accurate and consistent enough, as well as makes sure that no consumer health data can be accessed by an unauthorized party. It often sets guidelines for the marketing of the feature; in this case, you should be over the age of 22 and not be diagnosed with any respiratory illness, including sleep apnea. Of course, they can't enforce this, but once it's in print, Samsung is following the rules.</p><p>Once all this happens, we can use our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch</a> to tell us if we stop breathing during the night once we receive a software update that enables the feature.</p><h2 id="why-not-wait-until-it-s-approved-2">Why not wait until it's approved?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a simple answer — companies don't hold back products for this because they want to sell products, and you don't want to wait for it to be approved.</p><p>Most people didn't buy a Galaxy Watch only because they wanted to monitor for sleep apnea. I'd say the people who really wanted this feature are just a small percentage of users. I like it, you may like it, most people just don't care.</p><p>None of those people could have bought a Galaxy Watch if it weren't available, and would have bought a different model. Waiting until September of last year to release the device would have meant a lot of missed sales from people who didn't plan to use sleep apnea detection in the first place. That's not good for business.</p><p>It's worth noting that some companies, such as Samsung and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too" target="_blank">Apple</a>, are able to obtain approval much faster than others. It shouldn't be that way, but it is. My best guess is these large companies have a relationship with the right people and a good understanding of the entire process.</p><p>That said, there are some features, such as blood pressure monitoring, that even these companies haven't been able to weasel their way into getting FDA-approved.</p><p>If the next wearable you want launches minus a health feature or two, don't be afraid to buy it anyway. Approval is probably coming; it's just that the government only has one speed — a slow one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The AI revolution has mostly shaken up the software world, with specialized AI hardware devices flopping — we haven't forgotten the disasters that were the Humane AI Pin or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> just yet.</p><p>When a new AI device pops up, contrarians are quick to point out that it "could've been an app." Sometimes that's true, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-not-just-an-app">sometimes it's not</a>. AI voice recorders are particularly gaining traction among those who want new bleeding-edge hardware, and Plaud is leading the charge. The company's Note and NotePin devices aim to go with you daily to record conversations, meetings, and notes, transcribing them later in the Plaud app.</p><p>I wore the Plaud NotePin on my wrist for a week to figure out whether it's really a helpful companion, or an overpriced AI product that, well, could've been an app. Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="plaud-nailed-the-notepin-s-design-and-form-factor-2">Plaud nailed the NotePin's design and form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-2" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't impressed by the respective form factors of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">AI Pin</a> or the Rabbit R1. They looked too bulky and inconvenient to wear or carry daily. With these kinds of devices, they're only useful if you <em>actually</em> want to carry them. An AI assistant or voice recorder is of no use if you forget it at home or it's buried in a bag.</p><p>Luckily, Plaud struck the right balance of utility and compactness with the NotePin. It's a small, pill-shaped device that can conform to be worn in a few different form factors. There's a smartwatch-like wristband, a lanyard necklace, a clip, and a magnetic "pin" option included in the accessory kit. It's worth noting that only the pin and clip are included with the NotePin — the other items will cost extra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-3" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wore the wristband most often, as it's incredibly comfortable and unobtrusive for anyone used to wearing watches daily. It might look a bit strange wearing a NotePin on one wrist and a smartwatch on the other, but I did it anyway.</p><p>With up to 40 days of standby time and up to 20 hours of continuous recording, you should be able to wear your NotePin for plenty of time in between charges. I found those battery life estimates to be very generous — you will probably need to charge more often than that. But with only two hours needed to recharge, it won't be much of a hassle.</p><h2 id="plaud-s-pricing-model-is-extremely-hard-to-justify-2">Plaud's pricing model is extremely hard to justify</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-5" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI hardware products are extremely difficult to price out. Devices that rely on cloud servers incur ongoing costs for the companies supporting those off-device features. While subscriptions aren't fun, I actually think they're necessary for AI hardware. A product being sold with a one-time, upfront cost is almost certain to be bricked in the long run — the economics almost necessitate that.</p><p>Plaud went with the worst of both worlds for its NotePin pricing model. It has an extremely high upfront cost for what it is, retailing for $159. On top of that, you'll need to pay for a subscription to unlock all AI features beyond the initial free trial period. Plaud's AI Pro plan costs $100 per year and still comes with rate limits. The AI Unlimited tier costs $240 per year for the full, unabridged experience.</p><p>To put it lightly, this pricing model is insane. With the unlimited plan, your first year of using the NotePin would cost $399, and that's before any extra accessories. Using it beyond that would incur greater subscription fees over time.</p><p>The subscription model isn't the issue. The problem is that you can't ask customers to pay extreme hardware costs <em>and</em> subscription fees. Plaud <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">should've followed in Whoop's footsteps</a>, including the hardware for free while charging monthly for its subscription plan.</p><h2 id="the-recording-and-transcription-features-are-fine-but-not-outstanding-2">The recording and transcription features are fine, but not outstanding</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-4" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't help that I wasn't blown away by Plaud's ability to record my conversations and transcribe them. The Plaud NotePin didn't do a bad job by any means, but it wasn't outstanding, and it needed to be to justify its cost.</p><p>The way it works is simple: you long-press the NotePin to start recording, press again to stop recording, and let the recording upload to the Plaud app on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. After that, it'll need to be uploaded to the cloud for processing and returned to your device.</p><p>Like anything dependent on the cloud, this will take time. While uploading and transcribing your recording, the app says it'll take "a few minutes to complete" and that it will "continue if you navigate away from this page." So, I closed the app for about 10 minutes, let Plaud do its thing, and checked back in.</p><p>Instead of seeing a summary, I received a new message stating, "The network is unstable, it may take a little longer than expected." That was unusual, so I ran an internet speed test on my phone. Sure enough, my download speed was 891Mbps at the time that message appeared, which is more than fast enough for what the Plaud app was trying to do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-Screenshot" alt="Screenshots of the Plaud app trying to transcribe my recording." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt like Plaud was trying to pass the buck on the user for its slow processing times, since my Wi-Fi 6E connection certainly wasn't the issue. The 10-minute waiting period for a roughly 30-minute conversation to process was frustrating enough, but playing the blame game was even worse.</p><p>To be clear, it wasn't all bad. Most transcriptions took about three to five minutes to process, which still isn't fantastic but is passable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V38CV99aPRiWJpuYueCiWN" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-6" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V38CV99aPRiWJpuYueCiWN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the Plaud app provides more detailed transcriptions than any voice recorder app I've used. It creates an organized summary of the conversation and identifies the name of each speaker.</p><p>Beyond that, you get a mind map showing the flow of the entire conversation, plus an outline with isolated topics you can jump to at any time. Plaud also has an AI chatbot that can answer specific questions about your voice recordings, which some users might find really helpful.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-a-matter-of-if-android-apps-can-do-it-better-2">It's not a matter of if — Android apps CAN do it better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zJwgWeVhkLTqmjWZ2Z2Lni" name="Pixel-Recorder-1" alt="The Google Recorder app on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJwgWeVhkLTqmjWZ2Z2Lni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this case, it does feel like the Plaud NotePin could have been an app, as clichéd as that might sound. Something that uses on-device processing, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a> Nano model, would be infinitely better than Plaud's reliance on the cloud. It'd be more private, more secure, and generally more helpful.</p><p>In fact, that's exactly what the Google Recorder app does on Google Pixel phones. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/08/recorder-app-on-pixel-sees-boost-in-engagement-with-gemini-nano.html" target="_blank">Google switched to using Gemini Nano on-device</a> to process recordings in 2024, supporting real-time transcription and processing of long recordings. While the Recorder app doesn't natively support a chatbot function, you can upload recorded files to Gemini to get transcriptions, summaries, and contextual conversations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wgxp8SyLod7RPdy4wwmac7" name="Pixel-Recorder-2" alt="The Google Recorder app on a Pixel transcribing a conversation in real time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgxp8SyLod7RPdy4wwmac7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Recorder app on a Pixel transcribing a conversation in real time. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While testing the Plaud NotePin with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-recorder-android-quick-settings">Google Recorder app</a>, I vastly preferred using my Pixel 9 Pro XL for recordings and transcriptions. For one, I might have to wait as long as 10 minutes for the NotePin to transfer, upload, and process recordings. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL was transcribing my conversation <em>instantly</em> while I was speaking.</p><p>It's true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is expensive, but the phone you already have in your pocket probably supports this feature. Apple, Google, and Samsung all offer apps that do the same thing, and they're included with your phone for free. You could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">refurbished Pixel 7a</a> for under $200 to get the Google Recorder app for much less than a full year of paying for the Plaud NotePin and its unlimited subscription plan.</p><p>I've been a loyal Google Recorder user since 2022, when I started using it alongside the Pixel 7 series. After switching to the Plaud NotePin for a week, I don't feel a strong incentive to replace it with a Pixel for my recording needs. With a Pixel phone, Google Recorder, and Gemini, you can get a similar experience with no subscription.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8b417990-b4f7-463a-b689-631bfad5b6db">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmh2uy3VvdtG6HpLc2Ao2d.jpg' alt="The Plaud NotePin in a white render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Plaud NotePin</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A tough sell</strong></em></p><p>The Plaud NotePin is relatively good at what it does, but you'll need to be comfortable with long transcription times, a high up-front cost, and recurring subscription fees.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Limoncello leans into the yellow-green combo we've seen in earlier leaks; Indigo takes after the Bay blue and darkens it up, and Frost lands somewhere between light blue and a soft purple tint.</p><h2 id="ditching-the-chill-tones-2">Ditching the chill tones</h2><p>The latest leak suggests Google is taking a more daring turn with its design. While past models, like the Pixel 9, leaned into subtle tones, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> lineup looks way more vivid and saturated. The tech giant is clearly not shying away from color this time, possibly aiming to give the Pixel 10 a more confident look that grabs attention right out of the gate.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in blue (Indigo)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in lime (Limoncello)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in black (Obsidian)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting takeaway from the Pixel 10 leak is that Porcelain (Google’s go-to white or off-white shade) might be getting the axe. It’s been a staple across Pixel releases, but its absence this time around, possibly in favor of cooler tones like Frost, points to Google leaning into a more colorful direction with its design choices.</p><p>There was talk earlier that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">might tie certain Pixel 10 colors to specific storage options</a>. The base model was rumored to stick with 128GB, while the Pixel 10 Pro could start at 256GB or higher. If that holds true, colors like Limoncello might only show up on certain configurations. This means your storage choice could end up deciding your color, too.</p><h2 id="telephoto-for-the-base-model-2">Telephoto for the base model?</h2><p>The renders also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">corroborate recent rumors that Google may have reworked the Pixel 10’s camera setup</a>. The glass section on the camera bar is now wider, making room for a third lens: a telephoto, which is surprisingly showing up on the standard Pixel 10 this time.</p><p>But there’s a trade-off: adding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/camera-specs-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-hinting-at-a-significant-downgrade">telephoto lens might come at the cost of smaller sensors elsewhere</a>. Reports suggest the main rear camera could drop from 50MP to 48MP, and the ultrawide might shrink from 48MP to just 12MP.</p><p>In related news, Google has just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">teased the Pixel 10 series on its official store</a>. With launch day getting closer, we’ll probably see even more leaks roll out, shedding light on the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication was able to snag the image before the takedown occurred. Blass suggests that the device will feature a design that mirrors what Samsung launched with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. While it's a very Apple reminiscent design (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">something execs have criticised</a>), the company appears to want a continuation of it, at least for now.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE could see the same stick stabilizer to help when worn, with silicon tips, just like the Buds 3 Pro. Samsung called this a "Blade design" when the Buds 3 series launched last year.</p><p>The buds are shown off in white, although it's unclear if they will be glossy like the base Galaxy Buds 3 or more matte, like the 3 Pro. Blass didn't allege anything like specs or potential pricing. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">Galaxy Buds FE</a> debuted two years ago for $99. However, considering Samsung might pack in its Galaxy AI (and probably Gemini), there's no telling if that price will go up a little whenever it launches.</p><h2 id="fe-for-the-rest-2">FE for the rest?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.46%;"><img id="gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of the alleged Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in white with black silicon tips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1017" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also another major distinction between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">the Buds 3 Pro</a> and the base model: Samsung's blade lights. The Pro variant offers "Blade Lights" along the stabilizer that act as a bit of extra flair. Users can have these lights on continuously (stable) or have them fade in and out. Samsung's base 3 Pro doesn't offer this extra flair, so it remains to be seen <em>if </em>the Galaxy Buds 3 FE bring that in.</p><p>Although considering the "FE" tag, perhaps not. Additionally, we can likely expect the same blade design media and call controls to remain, just like its flagship counterparts.</p><p>You might've missed this, but Samsung recently dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-teases-its-new-galaxy-buds-ahead-of-launch">a pair of cheap earbuds</a>, dubbed the Galaxy Buds Core, overseas in India and other regions. It's unclear if these buds will see a global launch or make their way to the U.S., but considering we're seeing Galaxy Buds 3 FE rumors, <em>maybe </em>there are other plans.</p><p>A more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/leaked-renders-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-galaxy-s25-fe-changes-rumored">recent leak dropped renders</a> for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 FE. It seems both devices are in for some subtle design changes, such as an Infinity-U camera cutout for the Tab S11 Ultra's front camera and the potential removal of its S Pen slot on its back. For the S25 FE, it looks like Samsung is bringing its shiny silvery rings to its camera lenses, instead of the black rings like the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>There's speculation that the Korean OEM is looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">debut its tablet series "shortly"</a> following Unpacked, and this could bring the S25 FE with it. These earbuds could find their way into the mix.

Once again, the company confirms that its Made by Google event to reveal the next Pixel line will occur on August 20. What's most important in this teaser is Google's official look at the Pixel 10's design.</p><p>The header confirms the series will look pretty similar to the Pixel 9 series, boasting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">rather large camera bump</a>, flat sides, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's unclear which device Google's teasing. The model features three lenses, which could point us toward the Pixel 10 Pro or 10 Pro XL devices. However, there were rumors that the base model would grab a third lens, moving it closer to the company's higher-tier Pixels. Additionally, Google is offering an "exclusive offer" for new users who subscribe to its store's emails.</p><p>If you've freshly signed up, Google states you will receive a promotional code on August 20 (the day of the event). Its fine print adds, "Use of promo code is limited to a discount on one eligible device." Users have from today (July 21) to August 18 to sign up for Google Store emails and be eligible for its promo code on August 20.</p><h2 id="big-pixel-10-2">Big (Pixel) 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.88%;"><img id="Fsxbd9EpN34xPPfL4x8dG8" name="google-pixel-10-number-teaser" alt="The number "10" as seen during Google's official Pixel 10 teaser." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fsxbd9EpN34xPPfL4x8dG8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1884" height="902" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There were two sets of camera rumors about the Pixel 10, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">first surfacing in June</a>, stating the series' telephoto lens could double as a macro camera.

A Google spokesperson reached out to Android Central, stating, "We’re actively working to fix an issue that is affecting media playback controls on Google Maps."</p><p>We all know that Google Maps is one of the most popular navigation apps, be it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iOS handsets, allowing users to connect to their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> like YouTube Music and Spotify for easy access while navigating. The handy controls gave users the ability to play/pause music and skip or go to previous tracks. Having the music playback controls while navigating is one such convenience that Maps offers, which surprisingly has gone missing in the latest update.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/19/google-maps-media-controls/">9to5Google</a> now finds that the handy controls, normally found under the Navigation settings of the Maps app, have seemingly been removed, along with the toggle to “Show media playback controls.”</p><p>Additionally, the option to set the music streaming service is missing from the latest version of the Google Maps app. It seemingly applies to the latest v25.28 version alongside the beta 25.29 version. I couldn’t find the same, as I also checked on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> running the same stable version of Google Maps.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-not-available" alt="Google Maps without playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps without playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-old" alt="Google Maps with playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps with playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Some Android Central staff also saw that the controls are still on certain devices, while missing from others. It remains unclear whether the removal of the most popular feature from Maps was a deliberate decision or an unintended bug. The feature, however, as 9to5 notes, is still available on the latest iOS version of Google Maps.</p><p>If it isn't a bug as anticipated and is intentional, it will follow the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-officially-killed-driving-mode-after-stripping-most-of-its-features-in-2024">removal of Assistant Driving mode</a>. It was removed as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> transition, and it also featured the media control bar similar to what Google Maps offers now.</p><p>However, with the Assistant Driving mode discontinued, having playback controls on Google Maps became handy. Well, that might not be the case anymore until the next update for the app rolls out, hopefully bringing back the popular feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to a recent leak, it might stick to the same price, which is good news if you were bracing for a bump.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260" target="_blank">Dealabs</a> claims Google is sticking with last year’s smartwatch price in Europe, which probably means folks in the U.S. can expect the same treatment (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-price/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This means the 41mm Pixel Watch 4 could go for €399 if you’re sticking with Wi-Fi, and €499 if you want LTE. The bigger 45mm version will likely hit €449 for Wi-Fi and €549 for LTE.</p><p>While U.S. pricing for the Pixel Watch 4 isn’t locked in yet, if history is any clue, it’ll probably match Europe’s numbers. Last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> launched at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, $399 for LTE, and both 45mm options went for $399 (Wi-Fi) and $449 (LTE). So, chances are Google sticks to that same pricing playbook this time around.</p><p>Since not much is changing under the hood based on leaks and rumors, it wouldn’t be surprising if Google leaves the price alone. Design-wise, the Pixel Watch 4 looks to keep the same circular style, just with slightly slimmer bezels.</p><h2 id="same-chip-small-tweaks-2">Same chip, small tweaks</h2><p>On the inside, the Pixel Watch 4 is said to stick with the same Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip as last year, so any performance gains will likely be minor tweaks rather than a major leap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there are a few upgrades worth noting. Leaks point to better battery life and faster charging, plus a new co-processor built to handle AI tasks more efficiently. Battery-wise, the 41mm model could jump from 307mAh to 327mAh, while the 45mm might go from 420mAh to 459mAh.</p><p>Another rumored addition to the Pixel Watch 4 is a new strength training mode. Google is also said to be working on a custom workout builder, so users can tailor routines to fit their own style.</p><p>This new setup looks aimed at giving you full control over how you train, from customizing warm-ups and cool-downs to tweaking your main workout. It’s a smarter way to train harder without pushing too far. And if you're on Fitbit Premium, you’ll probably also get AI-generated running tips that match how you run, not just some generic plan like what you get from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The question becomes: is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 worth the extra coin? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-and-durability-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Design and durability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2339px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-18" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2339" height="1316" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, let’s look at, well, looks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> is the largest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch, thicker than the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. But it also happens to be a smidge lighter. Both have three buttons, including a Quick Button for accessing frequently used options.</p><p>The biggest difference is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a digital-only bezel, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic adds a rotating bezel. Considering Andrew Myrick notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">his initial Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on </a>that the rotating bezel is his favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, this will be a big deal for a lot of people like him.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-26" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) on wrist hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 comes in four titanium finishes: Silver, Gray, White, and a new one: Blue. It has a large 1.5-inch AMOLED screen housed in a squircle design that affords up to 3,000 nits peak brightness. The screen is made from sapphire crystal, and the watch itself is as rugged as they come, meeting an IP68 and an impressive 10ATM rating as well as MIL-STD-810H standards for durability.</p><p>In terms of battery life, it has a 590mAh battery, the same as the previous generation model, which means it should last about four days in power savings mode, about two with frequent workout tracking, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic comes in basic Black or White, though you can spruce it up with various band types (sport, fabric, or hybrid as well as third-party options). It employs a thin and cushioned design that has been brought over from the original Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>This squircle design change is immediately noticeable, and Myrick notes that it’s one that grew on him after he became accustomed to it with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> after wearing that model for a while. As noted, along with the Dynamic Lug System, the big differentiator is the inclusion of a handy rotating bezel on this watch.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has a smaller 1.34-inch Super AMOLED sapphire crystal display with the same 3,000 nits peak brightness. It boasts both IP68 and MIL-STD-810H certification, but it isn’t quite as water-resistant for deep diving with “only” a 5ATM rating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-custom-Tile" alt="A custom "Morning" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing alarm and reminder info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery is also smaller at 445mAh, and while Samsung doesn’t note its rated battery life, you can expect to charge it at least every day or two if it falls in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Classic</a>, which has a slightly smaller battery.</p><p>There’s an LTE option with both watches as well as Bluetooth 5.3 and NFC for tap payments.

Both run on an Exynos W1000 processor and come loaded with Wear OS 6. Both have 64GB storage (that’s double that of the 2024 edition of the Galaxy Watch Ultra) and 2GB RAM.</p><p>Both track all the usual suspects when it comes to health, wellness, and vitals, thanks to the inclusion of a Samsung BioActive sensor. This includes workouts, calorie burn, activity levels, sleep, stress, temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, and more. They offer tailored sleep coaching, an area where Samsung has been upping the ante. This includes the ability to detect moderate to severe signs of sleep apnea.</p><p>There’s also Vascular Load tracking, which monitors your stress levels during sleep, and Antioxidant Index to measure your carotenoid levels. These relate to dietary intake and metabolism, and the data can help you make more informed lifestyle choices.</p><p>To use the latter, you need to remove the watch and place your finger on the underside sensor, which isn’t ideal, but it’s worth doing if cartenoid level measurements are important to you. High Stress Alerts will ping you if either watch notices your stress levels are too high, prompting you to take a breath. There’s also a mindfulness tracker and energy score.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Basic-Tile" alt="The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Runners will love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a>, which calculates your fitness level on a scale from one to 10 and delivers a customized and personalized training plan with real-time guidance and motivational insights to help you along on your journey.

So, if you’re the type of person who participates in a lot of outdoor sports, especially underwater activities, you’ll find value in it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Health-Tile" alt="The Health Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing ECG and antioxidant index" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The extra battery life is appreciated as well, but if you are already used to charging your smartwatch every day or two, you might be used to that routine anyway. With that said, longer battery life is always appreciated, especially on those days when you’re at 2% right before you’re about to go for a run.</p><p>Design and feature-wise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as its smaller Galaxy Watch 8 sister, is starting to look more like an Ultra model anyway, with the same cushioned and squircle design. However, there’s a key advantage with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic to keep in mind if you would use it: the rotating bezel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We haven’t yet tested the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 but based on Michael Hicks’ review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> (2024 model), if the iterative update offers even slight improvements, it won’t disappoint. He calls that model “a great smartwatch that’s enjoyable to use,” applauding how powerful and reliable it is. We also named the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">the best waterproof smartwatches</a> you can buy, and chances are the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 will take its spot on the list.</p><p>Interestingly, Hicks said last year that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra falls between casual and serious users. Given this, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is even more skewed to the casual side, but with all the same features serious users will appreciate, minus the extra battery life and durability, and with a cool rotating bezel. It’s the more elegant-looking of the two watches without sacrificing too much. So, it will likely be the preference for most users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bottom line: if you have an older model to trade in and it brings the price of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 in line with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, it’s worth considering. But it’s not necessary for most people unless you’re heavy into water and other outdoor sports, or you’re a power user where every last minute of battery life counts. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is a lovely medium that affords all the same features at a more affordable price and with a similar yet more stylish design.</p><p>If you want something smaller, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8. If you already have the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024), don’t bother upgrading just yet. It’s not a big enough jump in features to warrant it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="daa7d483-4899-4f3c-9eab-beba42584e7f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9QYyvUty8JP4cTFKaTMJN.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Only if you need it</strong></em></p><p>The biggest upgrades with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 over the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the more durable and water-resistant design, the larger screen, and the extra battery life.

The phone isn't expected for another year, but it's never too early to speculate on what may be. After all, Samsung has likely already begun work on its next flip phone.</p><p>Based solely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">our brief time with the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, it's not hard to see where the strengths and weaknesses lie. This helps us speculate the areas where we could see improvements with the Galaxy Z Flip 8, as well as places where Samsung may not change anything at all.</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Z Flip 8, and what do we want to see? Let's take a look.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-price-and-release-date"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Price and release date</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Different Colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung only just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in early July</a>, meaning we probably won't expect the Galaxy Z Flip 8 until next July. While previous summer Unpacked events took place in August, Samsung seems set on July being the new launch month for its foldables. Thus, barring any changes, we can expect a similar time frame for 2026.</p><p>As for pricing, there's no reason to believe Samsung will increase the price on the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We saw a $100 increase with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, but the Flip 7 retained the same pricing despite the new chip and larger cover screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, if Samsung continues to launch new Galaxy Z Flip FE models, we do hope that it considers lowering the price to something that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>, for example.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-specs"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Specs</span></h2><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8 (rumored/expected)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, 2520 x 1080, FHD+, Dynamic AMOLED 2X,  LTPO (1-120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>4.1-inch Super AMOLED, 60/120Hz, 948 x 1048</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 17 (One UI 9)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Exynos 2600</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front-facing Camera</p></td><td  ><p>10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,300mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 10W wireless charging, 4.5W reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-design-and-displays"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Design and displays</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is known to utilize smartphone designs over multiple years. Since the company just introduced a fresh design for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, we don't expect anything drastic for 2026. The phone will likely look very similar to this year's Flip, save for some minor cosmetic changes such as new colors and slightly different dimensions.</p><p>In fact, we hope Samsung doesn't make any drastic changes, as the company has seemingly perfected the Galaxy Z Flip 7 design.</p><p>Samsung was able to shave off some millimeters on the Z Flip 7 chassis, making the phone much thinner than its predecessor and its closest competitor. We hope that the Z Flip 8 is able to retain the same thinness, even with any potential changes Samsung makes.</p><p>One small change Samsung implemented from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">Flip 5 to the Flip 6</a> was a color-matched ring around the camera lenses.

That means that Galaxy Z Flip 8 could retain the 6.9-inch primary folding display and external 4.1-inch panel. An improved hinge design has resulted in a minimal crease compared to previous generations, something we expect Samsung to continue to improve.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung may introduce different colors with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We do hope some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 7 colors</a> remain, such as the Navy Blue and Coralred, but we would like to see other bold and vibrant colors, like the green it introduced with the Galaxy S22 series.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was a notable departure for Samsung, arriving with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> instead of the Snapdragon chip powering the rest of the company's flagship phones. Although there was no explanation provided, it's likely due to cost and efficiency considerations, given the nature of flip phones.</p><p>Because of this, we expect Samsung may stick with Exynos for the Galaxy Z Flip 8. In fact, Samsung has reportedly been working on a 2nm Exynos 2600. According to reports, it seems <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.newdaily.co.kr/site/data/html/2025/06/11/2025061100145.html">yields for the new chip are pretty high</a>, and Samsung seems confident enough in its upcoming chip that it will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-exynos-2600-benchmarks-predict-an-exciting-clash-with-snapdragon/">Early benchmarks</a> also suggest that the chip could be quite impressive, which is good news for the Galaxy Z Flip 8.</p><p>Aside from an Exynos chip, we expect the phone to feature at least 12GB of RAM to power Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. It will also likely come with 256GB and 512GB of storage, as Samsung has yet to launch a model with 1TB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-charging-port" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Charging Port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 received a battery increase from 4,000mAh to 4,300mAh, which is impressive given the slimmer profile. Samsung could increase the capacity, which it often does each year for some of its flagships, but it may also have the same battery. We also expect the same 25W wired charging speed, although given the decrease to 10W wireless charging on the Z Flip 7, we're unsure about what the Galaxy Z Flip 8 will end up with in that regard.</p><p>Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-asks-users-sacrifice-thin-phonesbuilt-in-qi2-magnets-survey">questioning consumers</a> about whether or not they want Qi2 magnets on their phones, which could suggest the company is looking into implementing this on its future phones. However, it's unclear if this will work on the Galaxy Z Flip 8. Motorola told Android Central that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> did not receive Qi2 because the magnets would not work with the design of the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jcJJQMqTttT5NAitBfBhXo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-selfies-hands-on-1" alt="Selfie camera using cover screen on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jcJJQMqTttT5NAitBfBhXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the cameras, Samsung is known to reuse sensors for multiple generations, meaning we can probably expect the Galaxy Z Flip 8 to have a 50MP primary sensor and 12MP ultrawide.

However, we can still wish for what we want to see based on the current (and even past) Galaxy Z Flip, with the hopes that Samsung will listen and deliver. Here are some of the features we hope to see:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was already a bit of a downgrade on the charging front, which is unfortunate to see on a $1,099 phone. The 25W charging speed is simply okay, but with phones like the Razr reaching as much as 68W, it's clear Samsung is purposely holding it back.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 8, we hope Samsung will finally give us flagship charging speeds, at least as much as 45W wired and 15W or more for wireless charging. This way, it will at least match some of the company's midrange phones and keep up with the steadily increasing battery capacity.</p><p>Qi2 support will also be nice, especially if built-in magnets are involved.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI button</strong></p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 includes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key</a>, which is meant to be a handy way to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> at the press of a button (and freeing the power button).

On the other hand, the Forerunner 970 is the most versatile Forerunner to ever exist, but at its highest price.</p><p>If you're trying to find out whether your needs best align with the Forerunner 570 or Forerunner 970, this comparison will help.</p><h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-vs-forerunner-570-design-and-display-2">Garmin Forerunner 970 vs. Forerunner 570: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="52mqnGLtPUSKzBku4Mk8RJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-side-view" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 from a side angle showing the golden "Forerunner" logo and Start / Back buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/52mqnGLtPUSKzBku4Mk8RJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's Forerunner lineup is all about practicality, and its design reflects this. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> and 570 are loaded with hardware buttons that make it easy to track laps and stop/start workouts on the fly. They come with a somewhat loud design, but this is typically appreciated by runners. Each is offered in unique colorways that can emphasize a sporty look, or you can opt for black to try to remain subtle.</p><p>Still, the Forerunner 970's polymer case doesn't look the most premium, and that's to preserve a lightweight build. It does have a titanium bezel and metal buttons for durability, though. There's also a colored Forerunner metal accent piece on the side to emphasize the runner-first ethos of this watch. It weighs 56 grams, and that includes the strap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gMQJMGVyK4amnUHSe6cCb8" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-04" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMQJMGVyK4amnUHSe6cCb8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3755" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Forerunner 970 is only available in one 47mm case size. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> is more versatile in this regard, as it's available in both 42mm and 47mm sizes. It also sports a polymer case, but uses a lighter and less premium aluminum bezel. This watch opts for Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, whereas the 970 goes with sapphire glass.</p><p>Overall, you can expect the Forerunner 570 to feel slightly less premium than the Forerunner 970. That being said, they're both cut from the same cloth, so there are a ton of design similarities here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin upgraded the display on the Forerunner 970, doubling its peak brightness. The smartwatch features a 1.4-inch AMOLED touchscreen with a 454x454 resolution. The move to AMOLED adds clarity and color while preserving brightness, and it doesn't appear to come at the cost of battery life.</p><p>By comparison, the Forerunner 570 ships with either a 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch screen, depending on what size you get. It's also an AMOLED panel, but this watch doesn't last as long as the Forerunner 970. Both watches will be plenty bright enough for outdoor workouts.</p><h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-vs-forerunner-570-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Forerunner 970 vs. Forerunner 570: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mapping-route" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing a course route on a detailed city map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are slight differences between the Forerunner 970 and 570 in terms of hardware.  Both watches use the same Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor, which is the latest and most accurate version. However, the 970 takes that one step further, adding ECG support and a skin temperature sensor. The Forerunner 970 and 570 both have a blood-oxygen sensor, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, and gyroscope.</p><p>The pricier 970 comes with quadruple the available storage space, with 32GB onboard. Meanwhile, you only get 8GB on the 570 for music and workout files. Additionally, the 970 has a few more GPS bands, and both support multi-band GPS.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 970 </p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 570</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>47 x 47 x 12.9mm, 22mm QuickFit band</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 42.4 x 42.4 x 12.9mm</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47 x 47 x 12.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>56 g</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>:<strong> </strong>42g</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 50g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium bezel, polymer case, silicone strap</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum bezel, silicone strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, sapphire glass</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5 ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.4" (454x454) AMOLED touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 1.2" (390 x 390)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 1.4" (454 x 454)</p><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>15 days, 23 hours (SatIQ GPS), 14 hours (multi-band GPS w/ music)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 10 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-only GNSS mode)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 11 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-Only GNSS mode)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, ECG, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HR, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Flashlight</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic & speaker</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of battery life, the Forerunner 970 will get you further.

They just aren't entirely equal. There are a few features exclusive to the Forerunner 970, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">Running Tolerance</a>. This will calculate a biomechanical "impact load" for each mile you run, adjusting for things like elevation and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It's aimed to help you avoid overexertion and overuse injuries.</p><p>There are other perks, like <strong>running economy</strong> and <strong>step speed</strong>, available if you happen to have an HRM-600 chest strap to add data points.

It does lack electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which has become commonplace on smartwatches and offline maps. Still, I'd bet that most runners don't use either of those features very often — I know I don't. It's an excellent, slim, and sporty watch for running that's versatile and available in multiple sizes.</p><p>On the other hand, the Forerunner 970 is for the runner who's envious of multisport watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and wants that experience on a Forerunner model. At $750, the 970 is expensive, but it's actually much cheaper than those top-tier models like the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro 3</a>.

Pre-orders for the device are rumored to start that same day, with full availability beginning Aug. 28.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is tipped to start with 256GB of storage, with upgrades to 512GB or 1TB available. Since the phone might not be available in the smaller 128GB base capacity, it will reportedly start at $1,199, an increase of $100 compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's rumored to be sold in Sterling Gray, Light Porcelain, Midnight, and Smoky Green colorways.</p><p>Even with a rumored price hike, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will cost less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> at full price. The phone was announced on Jan. 22, 2025, and was officially released Feb. 7. Samsung sells the Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,299, and it starts with 256GB of storage, with upgrades up to 1TB available.

By this point, we've not only seen alleged renderings for the device but also real-life shots. If these turn out to be true, we're looking at a design language that's quite similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. There's a pill-shaped camera bar, a matte back, polished side rails, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's possible that the dimensions are tweaked slightly, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">early case samples support that prediction</a>. However, we still expect the Pixel 10 Pro XL to keep a similar form factor to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which measured 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm and weighed 221 grams. After all, both phones have a 6.9-inch screen and the same hardware, according to rumors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It'll likely be a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED panel capable of 120Hz refresh rates and at least 3000 nits of peak brightness. The resolution is said to be 2992 x 1344 pixels, which is the same as last year. Covering the display will be Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it'll also serve as the rear glass.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has a similar footprint, with dimensions measuring 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm. In fact, it'll likely be both thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That's despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra offering a bigger, 6.9-inch screen and space for an internally stored S Pen stylus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-16x9" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Home Screen - 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is a 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED with support for 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and a resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels.

Samsung opted for a titanium construction on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which helps with strength and weight.</p><p>Both the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Galaxy S25 Ultra are expected to sport an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is set to upgrade the internals of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, per reports, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which is no surprise. The bigger deal is that the Tensor G5 chip is said to be fabricated by TSMC, rather than Samsung Foundry, and will use the advanced 3nm process. As part of the switch, Google is said to be moving to more custom internal components, perhaps improving Pixel's optimizations and efficiency gains.</p><p>With a Google-designed chip, more custom components, and TSMC fabrication, the Tensor G5 could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL become the most efficient and smooth Android phone yet. The phone is expected to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra will still be the performance champion, despite all of Google's expected improvements. It is equipped with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the fastest available for Android phones.

It has four rear camera sensors, and the system is highlighted by a 200MP wide camera. On top of that, you get a 50MP ultrawide, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. Put simply, this may be the most versatile system available in the U.S. market, fit for any situation.</p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to keep things exactly the same as its predecessor. That would mean three rear cameras, starting with a 50MP, f/1.7 main camera. The secondary cameras would be a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP periscope telephoto lens, with the latter being capable of 5x optical zoom.</p><p>There's more than meets the eye here, as hardware is only part of the story. If you prefer Samsung or Google's computational photography and color science profiles, that may be reason enough to choose one phone over another.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-to-wait-or-to-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: To wait or to buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are sure to be competitors immediately after the former's release. With the Galaxy S25 Ultra getting older, it'll likely see discounts that will help it match or beat the $1,199 price point of the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Samsung's use of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset will ensure the Galaxy S25 Ultra has an edge, even over the Tensor G5 processor in the newest Pixel.</p><p>There will be clear reasons to pick the Galaxy S25 Ultra over the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Aside from performance, the Galaxy has a larger display and S Pen support. It also brings along five total cameras and a combination of Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>. All of these could be deciding factors for people in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great Android phone</a>.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will have plenty of reasons to exist. It's slightly more compact, runs Pixel UI over One UI, and has Google's efficiency and optimization. It'll just be hard for Google's highest-end flagship to beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra on paper.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3bb2d9ca-466d-4901-899b-e1c624b1fb74">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZEu2Ducm7W2oGBJ8EuUfC.jpg' alt="The leaked render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A promising upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL should be an enticing Android phone due to the Tensor G5 platform shift and other improvements.

It's the long-awaited successor to the Phone 2, a phone that debuted in 2023 at a more affordable price point. Now, the question is simple: did Nothing do enough to make the Phone 3 a great value at $800?</p><p>On paper, it seems like the answer is a firm "no." The Nothing Phone 3 lacks a flagship processor and key specs, like LTPO support. Still, the Phone 3 is the evolution of the Phone 2, so should Nothing fans upgrade? Let's see how the new Nothing Phone 3 stacks up against the Phone 2 and find out.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-pricing-and-availability-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a> became widely available worldwide on July 15, 2025. The phone costs $799 for the 12GB/256GB version, and $899 for the 16GB/512GB model. It's also available in Europe, the U.K., and India. You can get it in white or black colorways, and both get the customizable and interactive dot matrix display.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> launched in 2023 and started at $599 USD / $929 CAD for the 8GB/128GB configuration. The smartphone could be equipped with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for a higher cost. Now, two years later, it's hard to find new Phone 2 models at reasonable prices. It's no longer sold through the Nothing store, so you'll have to look at third parties and used markets.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing phones have never conformed to conventional design standards, but the Phone 3 diverts from the brand's own storied designs. Every Nothing phone to date, up until the Phone 3, has had a Glyph interface — a system of light strips that can be used for everything from notification and call alerts to serving as a makeshift flashlight.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2 features the Glyph interface, but the Nothing Phone 3 leaves that design staple behind in favor of a dot matrix grid. It's a tiny display that's more versatile than the Glyph interface, showing things like battery life and fun elements like Glyph Toys.</p><p>Officially, Nothing calls this the Glyph Matrix. If you've seen the rear display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, you already have an idea of what to expect from the Phone 3's Glyph Matrix.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-05.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone (2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Phone 3 and Phone 2 are quite similar in terms of form factor. The newer model is actually a bit smaller, sporting a 6.67-inch screen instead of the 6.7-inch panel found on its predecessor. Both use OLED displays with 1,600 nits of peak brightness and can hit 120Hz refresh rates. Unfortunately, neither phone is using advanced display technology like LTPO variable refresh rates or high brightness modes.</p><p>As such, the Nothing Phone 3 is more compact overall but is thicker, measuring 160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm. Meanwhile, the Phone 2 is thinner and lighter, measuring 162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm and weighing in at 201.2 grams. At 218 grams, the Nothing Phone 3 will feel noticeably heavier than the Phone 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing also made sure the Phone 3 stood out in a crowd with its unique rear camera arrangement. There are three lenses on the back, but they're all positioned individually across the top-left corner of the device. By comparison, the Phone 2 has two rear lenses neatly organized vertically, closely resembling an iPhone camera layout.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 received a much-needed durability upgrade, as it now supports IP68 dust and water resistance. With only an IP54 certification, the dust and water-resistance capabilities of the older Phone 2 lagged behind the competition.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-hardware-and-specs-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing's positioning of the Phone 3 as a true flagship starts to fall apart when moving to the device's internals.

Without it, the Nothing Phone 3's peak performance is limited.</p><p>With that being said, this chipset will make the Phone 3 feel much faster than the Phone 2 it replaces. The Nothing Phone 2 is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 mobile platform, and it's an older processor that isn't positioned well for the AI era. Additionally, you could make the argument that like the Nothing Phone 3, Google Pixel phones and their Tensor processors will lose to Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered flagships in raw performance.</p><p>Still, when you can get phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for only a few bucks more, it makes paying $800 for the Nothing Phone 3 a tough sell.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 3</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.67-inch 120Hz OLED, Gorilla Glass 7i, 1,600 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch 120Hz OLED (LTPO), 2142 x 1080 (394 PPI), 1,600 nits peak brightness, Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 2 based on Android 13 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, Adreno 825, 4nm node</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB or 12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Sony IMX890, ƒ/1.88, 1.0μm, 1/1.56-inch sensor size, OIS and EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP  f/2.7 ISOCELL JN5, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Samsung JN1 sensor, ƒ/2.2, 0.64μm, 1/2.76-inch sensor size, 114-degree FoV, EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ISOCELL JN1, 4K60 video</p></td><td  ><p>32MP, ƒ/2.45, 1/2.7-inch sensor size</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP54 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, Dual-band GPS, AptX HD</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Wi-Fi 6, 5G Sub-6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>In-display fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, 3 microphones with noise suppression</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery (5,500mAh in India), 65W USB PD charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm; 218g</p></td><td  ><p>162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm; 201.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Black</p></td><td  ><p>White, Dark Gray</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Compared to Phone 2, the Nothing Phone 3 has the key advantage of having more base RAM and storage.

Or, whether you have a Google Pixel phone that can tightly integrate with the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>If you're choosing between the Garmin Vivoactive 6 and the Google Pixel Watch 3, let's break down how these smartwatches compare.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-13" alt="A workout on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> have relatively muted and simplistic designs, at least compared to other smartwatches. Google offers the Pixel Watch 3 in two different case sizes: 41mm and 45mm, allowing you to choose the one that best matches your wrist size. This does come at an extra cost — the 41mm watch starts at $349, and the 45mm watch starts at $399.</p><p>Still, it may serve you better than the Vivoactive 6, which tries to find a middle ground as a one-size-fits-all watch with a 42mm case size. It's cheaper, retailing for $299, and also thinner. At 10.9 mm thick, the Vivoactive 6 will have a slimmer profile on the wrist than the 12.3mm Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-weather-tile" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing the Weather tile, with an hourly forecast for the evening." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's Vivoactive 6 is made using a fiber-reinforced polymer case with an anodized aluminum bezel and a silicone strap.

The Vivoactive 6 sports a 1.2-inch AMOLED screen with a 390x390 resolution, and if you're used to bigger smartwatch displays, this might feel a bit cramped. Surprisingly, Google crammed a bigger display into a smaller case size, as the 41mm Pixel Watch 3 comes with a 1.27-inch AMOLED panel with a 408x408 resolution.</p><p>Of course, you can always step up to the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 if you need a bigger screen. The larger variant has a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a 456x456 resolution.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Garmin Vivoactive 6 provides a robust health and fitness experience of the features it <em>does</em> support, there are some gaps. For instance, the watch includes the last-gen Garmin Elevate v4 heart-rate monitor, an accelerometer, a pulse-oxygen sensor, a compass, and a gyroscope. This, paired with Garmin software, helps paint a pretty full picture of your health and fitness data at the $299 price point.</p><p>Still, there are things missing, like a barometric altimeter — this means you can't track elevation during runs or hikes. Other key hardware omissions include a microphone and speaker, so you won't be answering calls on your watch with the Vivoactive 6.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel Watch 3 has a more well-rounded sensor suite, adding an altimeter, barometer, electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA) sensor, and a skin temperature sensor. It also supports ECG readings, if you care about those. The tricky part about this comparison is that the Pixel Watch doesn't always make the most of this data because its software features are limited.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Vivoactive 6</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer (Case); Anodized aluminum (Bezel)</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen, 390 x 309</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass 3; 5ATM</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>20mm quick-release band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS, BeiDou; All-Systems mode (No dual band)</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v4 HRM; Pulse Ox (SpO2); accelerometer; ambient light sensor; compass; gyroscope</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Garmin Pay (NFC), Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic and speaker</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Smartwatch mode: 11 days</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/ 420mAh, 24 hours with AOD, 36 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Music storage</p></td><td  ><p>8GB; Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music, or own music files</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42.2 x 42.2 x 10.9 mm</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight / with strap</p></td><td  ><p>23g / 36g</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 55g/63g; 45mm: 61g/69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$299.99</p></td><td  ><p>$349.99 (41mm), $399.99 (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Additionally, the Google Pixel Watch 3 does support LTE connectivity, but you have to pay extra for that model.

Both excel in their own key areas. Despite having fewer sensors, the Vivoactive 6 has a better health and fitness software suite.</p><p>It can track more than 80 different kinds of workouts, which is great if you train outside the box. Garmin's software will also suggest daily walks for you to keep you active and moving. There are workout videos viewable right on the watch and specialized features like workout tracking. This will detect your weightlifting reps and rests automatically during and between sets.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 uses Fitbit primarily for health and fitness software. It's not as great an experience as Garmin's robust suite, but it may do the job if you only track casual workouts. Crucially, the Pixel Watch 3 runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, which means you have a large suite of third-party apps and smartphone integration available.

GPS tracking is more consistent, and there are extra non-running features for those who prefer the gym to the track. If that sounds like you, the Vivoactive 6 will probably serve you better than the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>However, the Pixel Watch 3 has a similar advantage — it runs Wear OS. If you need tight integration with your Android phone, like the Fitbit UI, or rely on third-party smartwatch apps, the Pixel Watch 3 is your pick. It all depends on your individual needs. For health features, go with Garmin. For smart features, choose Pixel.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="75b5b5c4-3808-4a3c-b02b-217891e7919c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/secwvVBDhnoMFv8tL5mbJ6.jpg' alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Vivoactive 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All about fitness</strong></em></p><p>While the Vivoactive 6's health and fitness suite is relatively tame by Garmin standards, it's robust compared to Wear OS watches.

While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">Ear 1</a> had issues with tonality, Nothing resolved these with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, and subsequent products have been nothing short of incredible. So when the brand said it was venturing into headphones, I was obviously excited. I prefer over-ear headsets to earbuds, and the Headphone 1 is positioned as an alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> and Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Obviously, design is a key tenet of all Nothing products, and the Headphone 1 looks like nothing else available today. As much as I like the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, I think the Headphone 1 is Nothing's best-looking product yet. The unique rectangular design with a stylized outer shell that evokes memories of cassettes is just plain cool, and the novelty doesn't really wear off even after using the Headphone 1 for a while.</p><p>The white model in particular looks gorgeous, and the distinctive design is backed by good build quality. The shell is made out of aluminum, and it's joined by a plastic headband. At 329g, it is on the lighter end of the scale, and I like the comfort quite a bit — I didn't have any issues wearing the Headphone 1 for hours on end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The retro-futuristic design combined with a comfortable fit makes the Headphone 1 a better choice than the Sony WH-1000XM6, and I like the attention to detail.

The bundled case is pretty good as well, and it doesn't take up too much room. The Headphone 1 gets a 1,040mAh battery, and it lasted just under 30 hours in my testing. That's more than enough, and you get a fast charging mode that delivers two hours music playback with just a five-minute charge; a full charge takes over two hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing did a good job dialing in the noise isolation as well, and I didn't have any problems in this area. My QuietComfort Ultra still has the edge, but the Headphone 1 does a good enough job tuning out ambient sounds. You can easily customize settings via Nothing X, and there's also an 8-band EQ that allows for granular customization of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the sound, the Headphone 1 is made in collaboration with British audio powerhouse KEF.

The Headphone 1 has a custom 40mm driver with sound tuned by KEF, and it sounds amazing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's good low-end energy and vibrancy, and bass-focused tracks have a delightful rumble.

KEF's unique sound signature is evident in the tuning of these headphones, and if you want a neutral sound, you can easily tweak the EQ to your liking.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed using the Headphone 1 much more than I thought; if anything, I like the headphones more than the Phone 3. The design is sure to turn heads, it's comfortable to wear, sounds great, and is a better deal than its equivalent Sony and Bose rivals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5ac4b34e-edac-4c9d-97be-1dd875f0706e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:145.07%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWqC28UuSUoU6CKNKeXqn5.jpg' alt="Nothing Headphone 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Headphone 1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Headphone 1 is a standout product; it looks distinctive, has a fantastic sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It is an AI-powered app that effectively stores all your vital information. The company is now introducing additional features, making it even smarter.</p><p>Late last week, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/37461-essential-space-updates">rolled out an update</a> that incorporates Google Calendar.

Users who prefer to record meetings, interviews, or conversations will now be able to fix AI summaries with the edit feature. Further, these recorded moments are now shareable as well. They can be shared in notable formats like via an image, PDF, or Markdown, One tap, or fully packaged.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM" name="Essential-Space-editable-memory" alt="Essential Space editable memory" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record" alt="Essential Space Flip to record" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record-share" alt="Essential Space flip to record sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="who-gets-it-first-2">Who gets it first?</h2><p>As mentioned, the Essential Space feature is available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro</a>, and even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> has a new color option, and comes with 64GB of internal storage; other than that, it is identical to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024.</p><p>With Samsung choosing to not make any changes this year, any potential upgrades are only likely to show up on the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-Funny-Faces-watch-face" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a white counter, showing the Funny Faces watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has a distinctive design with the Galaxy Watch Ultra that makes it stand out quite a bit from the regular Galaxy Watch, and that's set to continue in 2026. I don't see the brand making any considerable tweaks to the design next year, but I would like to see the rotating bezel make its way onto the device.</p><p>The bezel makes interacting with a smartwatch that much more convenient, and it's a clear point of differentiation with Samsung. Another limiting factor is that the Galaxy Watch Ultra doesn't use standard lugs, and that needs to change; as it stands, there's a limited selection of bands you can use with the smartwatch.</p><p>The 47mm sizing makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra the ideal size, and I don't want that to change in 2026. Samsung does a good job with the chassis itself with the titanium casing clearly built to last, and it's a given that the brand will continue using the same material next year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-features"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra features the Exynos W1000 platform that's built on a 3nm node, and it delivers significant gains from previous years. I want slightly better efficiency with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 that allows the smartwatch to last at least three days between charges.</p><p>Outside of that, the only other feature I want to see is tighter AI integration. Samsung will ideally need to use a new platform based on the foundation of the W1000 but with a powerful NPU to deliver this, and it's likely we'll see just that in 2026.</p><p>On the feature side of things, Samsung really needs to make ECG available to other devices — having this limited to Samsung phones is a huge drawback. I routinely switch between phones, and not having all features available with a smartwatch is a deal-breaker.</p><p>Similarly, I'd like to see better activity tracking with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026; there are enough built-in workout modes, but the current iteration of the smartwatch just doesn't do as good a job as its Garmin rivals when it comes to accuracy.</p><p>Considering the lack of any meaningful upgrades with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, I'd suggest getting the 2024 model if you're interested in switching to a new smartwatch. It has the same feature-set, and it continues to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around — and there are great deals to be had right now. If you're willing to wait, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 should deliver decent gains next year.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0f600266-e8d2-486d-a420-234922bf4b3b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqnudFCbUPtb4UpBK5ztT6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'> </span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024 continues to be just as good as the 2025 model, and it's a much better value now that it's on sale. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung delivered plenty of upgrades with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>; the foldable has a thinner and lighter design than its predecessor, and it holds its own against its Chinese rivals in this regard. That's no small feat considering brands like Vivo and Honor have pushed the boundaries in this area in recent years.</p><p>That said, Samsung continues to lag behind when it comes to the battery and cameras, and it misses out on other extras that are standard on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>. I'm just getting started with my Z Fold 7, and this is what I want to see in next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at just 4.2mm when unfolded, the Z Fold 7 is one of the thinnest foldables around. That makes a clear difference when using the device next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Samsung did the right thing by increasing the cover panel to 6.5 inches. This was a major point of contention in the past, and it's thankfully not an issue on the Z Fold 7.</p><p>It's unlikely Samsung will alter the design next year — it has shown that it wants to retain a similar aesthetic year after year — but what I want to see is a slight tweak that makes the device easier to hold. The flat sides are a smidgen uncomfortable, and the addition of bevels like on the Magic V5 and Vivo X Fold 5 should make the Z Fold 8 that much easier to hold and use.</p><p>While Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, the Z Fold 8 is limited to IP48 ingress protection, with the Magic V5 and X Fold 5 featuring IP58 and IP59 dust and water resistance as standard. With Google set to deliver IP68 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Samsung needs to deliver better durability next year if it wants to maintain its position in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-battery"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Battery</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I like that the Z Fold 7 is considerably thinner, the foldable has the smallest battery of any device I used in 2025. The 4,400mAh battery is just pitiful when even smaller phones like the Vivo X200 FE have a 5,300mAh cell, and I don't really know what Samsung was thinking by putting such a small battery in its latest foldable.</p><p>Clearly, that needs to change in 2026. The Z Fold 8 needs to have at least a 5,000mAh battery, considering this year's Magic V5 has a 5,850mAh battery and the X Fold 5 comes with an even bigger 6,000mAh battery. Switching from the X Fold 5 to the Z Fold 7, there's a clear difference in battery longevity, and this is something Samsung has to rectify with the Z Fold 8.</p><p>On that note, 25W charging just isn't enough any longer on a device that's pushing $2,000. All other foldables I used this year at least have 66W charging, and Samsung is lagging behind by quite a big amount in this area. The biggest advantage of a foldable is the increased real estate made possible by the inner panel, but that's meaningless if the device doesn't even manage to last all day.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-29" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung did the right thing by upgrading the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a 200MP unit. This allows the foldable to hold its own against Honor and Vivo, and while it is undoubtedly a positive move, Samsung didn't lavish the same level of attention on the auxiliary cameras.</p><p>The 12MP wide-angle lens is decent enough, but the 10MP tele lens leaves much to be desired, and it just isn't as good as what you get on the X Fold 5 and Magic V5. Samsung clearly needs to address this shortcoming with the Galaxy Z Fold 8, because it's not just the main camera that differentiates a foldable, but the overall package.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7 just now starting to become available, we'll have to wait until July 2026 to see what the Z Fold 8 has in store. Thankfully, we should get plenty of details of Samsung's 2026 foldable before that time, and I'll update this post as and when new information becomes available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You fill out a quick survey with your age, height, weight, and gender, then log the furthest distance you've run — None, 5K, 10K, half marathon, or marathon — and how fast you finished.</p><p>You must then complete a 12-minute "running test," starting at a "comfortably hard pace" before building to "full speed," and are lastly timed on how quickly your heart rate recovers during cooldown. It's Samsung's equivalent to the lactate threshold test.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nh16o10JOR4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Based on your survey and test results, Samsung gives you a 1–10 rank; each level has a target distance and pace that you must hit to level up. Levels 1–3 focus on finishing a 5K, 4–5 on 10Ks, 6–7 on a half marathon, and 8–10 on a full marathon.</p><p>For each level, you're given a 3-to-5-week training plan, with tailored runs each week to build up your speed and endurance. Only after you've completed most of your workout plan can you take the "level test" and graduate to the next tier.</p><div ><table><caption>Samsung Running Coach levels</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Level</p></th><th  ><p>Goal</p></th><th  ><p>Test</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>1–3</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 5K under 35 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 1: </strong>0.93 miles under 10:22 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 2: </strong>1.86 miles under 20:45 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 3: </strong>3.10 miles under 34:34 (11:09/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>4–5</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 10K under 1:10</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 4: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:09:09 (11:08/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 5: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>6–7</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a half marathon under 2:30</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 6: </strong>9.32 miles under 1:42:43 (11:01/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 7: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:24:08 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>8–10</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a marathon under 5:00</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 8: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:20:38 (10:44/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 9: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:17:07 (10:28/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 10: </strong>26.2 miles under 4:48:15 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Each workout plan is "designed to help users train safely for marathons" or shorter distances through "optimized intensity and injury-preventive routines." Samsung says an "experienced runner" should find a program that's right for them, even if Running Coach is "ideal for beginners."</p><p>While the lower levels focus on walking, jogging, and low-intensity runs to build endurance, the higher levels have a wide range of activities: Fartlek runs, repetitions, high-intensity intervals, buildup runs, long slow distance runs, and jogging, among others. That kind of complex variety is vital for increasing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Kro5Gg67rCeJ8yjD4BEVr3" name="Samsung-Running-Coach-workout-plan-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic" alt="A Galaxy phone showing a Level 7 Samsung Running Coach training plan, with Week 1 showing one workout completed with a 96/100 score and three upcoming workouts.

Samsung knows that "serious" runners already gravitate towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatche">fitness watches</a> with long battery life. So it's focusing on amateurs, with a gamified system that introduces them to a wide range of workout types, without overwhelming them.</p><p>Running Coach has you complete 3–4 activities a week, but on your own schedule instead of Samsung's. This gives running newbies the leeway to recover from tough runs or give themselves an off-day without worrying about failing the program. You don't need to finish every workout before taking a level test, just enough to improve.</p><h2 id="samsung-running-coach-doesn-t-know-how-to-rank-experienced-runners-2">Samsung Running Coach doesn't know how to rank 'experienced runners'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-level-data" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic worn on a wrist outside, the display showing where Level 7 ranks on a distance timeline and the words "Beginner's half marathon: Level 7" underneath." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I took the Running Coach survey, I gave Samsung my last half-marathon pace (1hr:54m), then finished my Watch 8 running test at a 7:09/mile pace. It wasn't my best, as I had to run it on a rolling trail, and I ran too fast at the start, but I figured it would be enough to satisfy Samsung.</p><p>Instead, Samsung placed me in Level 7, the "beginner's half marathon tier," with a target of running a half in 2:24 — 30 minutes slower than I ran during a fairly mediocre (for me) race a month ago. Aside from stinging my ego, my workout training plan just isn't tailored to me.</p><p>My first recommended workout was a 5.5-mile "pace run" with a 3/5 difficulty score at 10:11 pace; I finished it at a 9:52 pace, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> on my other wrist graded it a "low-aerobic run," meaning not that hard. My next run of "high-intensity intervals" will max out at 9:07 pace for five 0.62-mile splits. Trust me, that's mid-intensity for me, at best.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Running Coach workout, with a distance of 3.1 miles and a target pace of 9:07." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand that this level-7 training plan isn't for me; it's intended for intermediate runners. However, Samsung needs to do a better job of ranking me or adapting to my average pace, as I can't manually level up. Instead, I would need to retake the 12-minute placement test or complete another 17 workouts at slow paces to qualify for level 8.</p><p>If Samsung let runners choose an HR zone instead of pace as the workout criteria, this would solve the issue and let runners target the intensity that's right for them.</p><p>For now, this Running Coach really is meant to, well, coach slow novice runners. It's a promising beta that <em>could</em> eventually help experienced runners. But so long as it focuses on building up mileage at a slow pace, those who want to get faster at their current race distance will be out of luck.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-has-some-fundamental-issues-for-runners-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has some fundamental issues for runners</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout-main-screen" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Most smartwatches have guided workouts that buzz your wrist if you fall out of the target pace or HR range. Samsung's Running Coach workouts follow this system, but not very well!</p><p>The photos above show the default workout screen, with your current pace, distance, average pace, and HR. The color changes if your HR average is too high or low, but it doesn't say anywhere what the target range <em>is</em>, or say if your current pace is outside the zone.</p><p>Worse, my "current pace" was erratic and incorrect for most of the run. The final tracked pace was 9:58/mile (Garmin measured 9:52), but the watch display usually showed me much slower than that (around 10:20–40), even as I got notifications saying I was on or above pace. Without my Garmin to ground me with actual pace data, I wouldn't have known how fast I was moving at any given moment.</p><p>The <em>most</em> annoying part was how the Watch 8 told me I was "on pace" over and over. I expect a notification when I go off pace and when I'm back on; that's it. Instead, every minute or two, I'd be told whether I was on pace, and I had to check every notification in case I wasn't. It distracted me from my rhythm and rarely conveyed useful info.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-5" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-1" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-2" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-3" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-4" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I wonder whether inconsistent GPS data led to the erratic pace data.

Maybe it's for a new album. Maybe it's for nostalgia. But rarely would you expect to enjoy a cover band better than the original.</p><p>That's how I feel about the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, a phone that looks identical to its predecessor, yet still somehow packs all the wonder and fun of the original without introducing anything new. Even stranger, it's the small cover display that I found enjoying the most, not the large, beautiful inner display that folds in half like liquid glass magic.</p><p>This isn't the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> I've reviewed for Android Central, by any means. I've spent ample time with Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip line since the second iteration, and I've used camera-focused alternatives from Chinese brands like Vivo. But none of them make a flip phone quite like Motorola, and so much of that is wrapped up in how the cover screen works and how it transforms the flip experience.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2025-specs-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 specs</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640x1080, HDR10+, LTPO 165Hz, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640 x 1080, HDR10+, 165Hz LTPO, 3000 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO, 2,400 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO 2400 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="the-cover-is-the-headliner-2">The cover is the headliner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-in-pocket" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025's cover screen hanging out of a pocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike book-style foldables — think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> — the cameras on the flip phones are basically attached to the cover display.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, Samsung still makes you jump through several hoops to get any app you want on the cover screen for a flawed experience. Motorola's implementation just works like a normal phone, including an app launcher, but it's the notification support that really makes a difference.</p><p>On a Galaxy Z Flip, when you receive a notification and tap it on the cover screen, the phone will often prompt you to unfold it to interact with that app or notification. On a Razr, the app just opens on the cover screen. That's it. Nothing complicated. No unnecessary extra steps or weird apps to install. It's as user-friendly as it gets, and it blows my mind that Samsung still hasn't fixed this problem with its Flips.</p><p>Because of this, I was able to fully enjoy the <em>tiny </em>size of the Razr Plus 2025 instead of getting annoyed that I had to open it constantly. It felt like a true pocket-friendly companion rather than something that was convenient when <em>it </em>wanted to be.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-01" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-02" alt="The Glamorous back of the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-flex-mode-camera-tented" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I prefer Motorola's design and build over Samsung's models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and 7 are overly flat phones, and I simply do not like flat phones. Having a curve to the edge of a device makes it nicer to hold, easier to open, and better looking overall, in my experience.</p><p>Not only that, but Motorola's use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">Pantone-certified colors and materials</a> is second to none.

In benchmarks, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is slightly faster than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> but slightly slower than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip <strong>5</strong></a>.</p><p>While that sounds concerning, real-world performance tells me that it doesn't matter. The only time I ever thought the phone felt slow was when I rebooted it after an update, and it was busy finalizing the update in the background. Most phones have a lag period after updating because of the app optimization process, so this isn't a cause for concern.</p><p>Having a "slower" processor ultimately means that the phone prioritizes battery life over performance, ensuring you won't run out of battery before the day is over. This was once a problem with flip phones, but Razrs solved that problem a while back. Plus, the 45W charging speed leaves Samsung's flip phones in the dust, with a full charge (0-100%) taking only 45 minutes in my testing.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL" name="IMG_20250701_192000634_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL" name="IMG_20250628_163501430_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2250" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL" name="IMG_20250626_074335664_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL" name="IMG_20250617_190131183_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>More often than not, the camera quality from this phone exceeded my expectations, which, to be frank, were low given Motorola's less-than-stellar reputation for camera quality. I should have expected good quality given the shots my wife has been able to pull off on her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/one-year-with-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> over the past year, but it's still nice to be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>I <em>love</em> taking portrait photos with this phone, especially since the cover display makes it so effortless. Taking group photos with this phone using portrait mode is nothing short of stunning, and everyone will regularly say "wow!" when they see the viewfinder on the cover screen. Seriously, it happens every time.</p><p>Motorola included a 2x telephoto camera on this year's model again, opting for moderately better zoom detail over the more useful ultrawide angle lens from the 2023 model. I would still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">prefer for Moto to revert to having a standard and an ultrawide lens</a> for the 2026 model, especially since the other two Razr 2025 models have this configuration.</p><h2 id="the-moto-ai-quotient-2">The Moto AI quotient</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-moto-ai" alt="Moto AI running on the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the big highlights of this year is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, a suite of new tools designed to be "helpful," as all AI things are marketed to be. The reality is that most of these features sound cooler or more useful than they actually are. Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">AI-generated playlists feature</a>, for example. It'll generate a playlist of songs based on your request, but it's limited to 10 songs in length and currently only works with Amazon Music.</p><p>Then there's the 'Catch Me Up' feature, designed to summarize your notifications when you've put your phone away for a while. I tried this several times when my phone accumulated dozens of notifications, but overall, it didn't seem particularly helpful.</p><p>The 'Remember This' feature sounded like something I would genuinely love to use. "Save screenshots, notes, and images to your Memory with AI-generated summaries and object recognition technology so that you can recall them later." The problem is that I had no idea where to find them after I saved them, and even after I figured it out, I stopped using the feature when I realized it took several steps to find what it saved.</p><p>There are many great ideas in here, and I think the suite could become <em>very</em> good with more development time. For now, though, it feels half-baked and more like a user study than a final product.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-2">Should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-green-with-motorola-plus-2025-mocha-02" alt="The folded backs of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Green and Motorola Razr Plus 2025 in Mocha" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're currently on a Razr Plus 2024, there's no reason to upgrade. Yes, Motorola has upgraded the hinge with titanium and improved dust resistance, but almost everything else about the phone remains the same.</p><p>The cameras are still excellent and often surprise me with their quality, particularly when using portrait mode. The phone features the same 4-year update guarantee as its predecessor. And while I commend Motorola for some of the ideas in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, I found nothing in the suite that I used daily.</p><p>Motorola sells the Razr Plus 2025 for $100 less than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. While Samsung offers seven years of software updates for its phone, I don't believe for a minute that any flip phone will last seven years without something breaking. I love foldables and can vouch for their durability, but I've seen numerous folding tests, and none of them suggest that a flip phone will last longer than five years at most.</p><p>Because of that, I recommend grabbing the Razr Plus 2025 over the Z Flip 7.

While the Google Pixel Watch 3 is a fan favorite among Android users, it still pales in comparison to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> from Samsung and OnePlus in key areas.</p><p>That's why we're looking forward to the upcoming Google Pixel Watch 4, which aims to address some of these pain points, potentially bringing the smartwatch into true flagship territory. The Pixel Watch 4 hasn't been officially revealed yet, but early rumors and leaks give us an idea of what the next Google Watch might bring. Here's a speculative breakdown of how the Pixel Watch 4 might improve upon the Pixel Watch 3.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> is expected to launch alongside the Pixel 10 series, which will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">debut at an August 20 event</a>. For reference, the Pixel Watch 3 was announced on August 13, 2024, and became available as of September 10, 2024.</p><p>As for pricing, no current rumors or leaks point to a price change for the Pixel Watch 4. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260">a recent leak</a> suggests that the price will remain the same in Europe, which is good news. That would mean you'll pay $349 for a 41mm watch and $399 for a 45mm watch, with optional LTE versions costing another $100 on top of that. However, these prices are unconfirmed and could certainly rise due to inflation and other supply chain factors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is currently available in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with prices starting at $349 and $399, respectively. Each size has three colorways: Matte Black and Polished Silver for both models, Champagne Gold as the 41mm exclusive, and Matte Hazel as the 45mm exclusive. The upgrade to cellular connectivity costs an extra $100.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">Leaked Google Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> might give us an early preview of Google's upcoming smartwatch. Put simply, the Pixel Watch 4 appears to have a questionable design, of these renders turn out to be accurate. They depict the Pixel Watch 4 as being about 2mm thicker than its predecessor, and without rear charging pins visible.</p><p>These design changes could be divisive among Pixel Watch fans. A positive of this change is that the Pixel Watch 4 could switch back to a wireless charging puck for power, rather than the contacts and pins on the Pixel Watch 3. On the flip side, this would mean that the Pixel Watch has changed charging methods three times in four generations, which isn't ideal for continuity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same "waterdrop" design language as its predecessors. This time, the bezels might be even slimmer, helping make the newer model feel more modern. If the case size remains roughly the same, we could see the Pixel Watch 4 displays slightly grow compared to the 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays on the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 measures 12.3mm thick, so if these rumors are true, the newer model could be close to 15mm thick.

I took it personally when Samsung estimated that I had "Low" antioxidants, so I spent the past week eating as healthily as possible to see if it made a difference.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s multicolored health sensors look for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids">carotenoids</a>, the pigment that gives fruits and veggies their bright red, orange, or yellow coloring; once in your body, they counterbalance the "oxidative stress" generated from poor lifestyle habits like smoking, drinking, overeating, and stress. Hence the name "antioxidants."</p><p>Generally speaking, the antioxidant index is intended to determine whether you&apos;re consuming your WHO-recommended 400g of fruits and vegetables per day. For health-conscious individuals who dislike logging their food daily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> offers valuable context.</p><p>But since I thought I <em>was </em>eating healthily enough, I decided to cram carotenoid-rich foods into my diet for a week to see whether Samsung would be able to detect the changes properly.</p><h2 id="how-the-antioxidant-index-score-works-on-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">How the Antioxidant Index score works on the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The BioActive sensor's multicolored LEDs that activate when measuring the antioxidant index. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your body stores carotenoids in the skin, where the Galaxy Watch 8's optical sensors can spot and measure them. Samsung told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/now-i-know-why-the-galaxy-8-watch-antioxidant-sensor-doesnt-use-your-wrist-and-its-so-obvious">TechRadar</a> that your wrist has too many capillaries, so your blood confuses the results; pressing your thumb against the sensor will "push away all the blood" and make it easier to check your carotenoid levels.</p><p>Carotenoids are just one type of antioxidant, but their pigmentation allows Samsung to detect them. We've emailed Samsung to ask if it might eventually track other antioxidants, but for now, carotenoids are the best estimate to check non-invasively if your body has other healthy vitamins and nutrients.</p><p>So, what foods have carotenoids? Samsung suggests <strong>root vegetables</strong> (carrots, sweet potatoes), <strong>leafy greens</strong> (spinach, kale), <strong>citrus fruits</strong> (oranges, mangoes), <strong>tomatoes</strong>, and <strong>bell peppers</strong>. Other carotenoid-rich foods include pumpkin, squash, cantaloupe, and corn; most red, orange, and yellow produce will likely have some.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung used data from clinical trials at Samsung Seoul Hospital to determine the "correlation between fruit and vegetable intake and the accumulation of carotenoids in the skin." Adequate antioxidant levels get a score of 75–100. People with "Low" scores (50–75) consume 50–99% of the recommended daily amount, so about a 2% increase per point. Very Low (0–49) is "less than 50%."</p><p>Samsung also warns that your score may fall during "periods of severe stress or when drinking or smoking," so it's about lifestyle as much as nutrition.</p><p>The company says it may change the criteria with "future clinical results," but the gist is that you want a score of 75 to match recommended levels. Everything above that is just gravy, while lower scores leave you vulnerable to "cell damage, excessive aging, inflammation, worsening eyesight, and chronic diseases such as cancer" over time.</p><h2 id="raising-my-antioxidant-index-score-on-my-galaxy-watch-8-2">Raising my Antioxidant Index score on my Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung warns that it can take "up to 2 weeks for your antioxidant index to reflect an increased intake of fruits and vegetables," so I knew that eating a boatload of carotenoids wouldn't instantly level me up. But I wanted to see if there was an obvious impact from a changed diet in the short term.</p><p>I stuck to my normal diet for the first day, and my reading stayed consistent. Starting on Monday, I raided my grocery store for carotenoid-rich fruits and veggies, then spent the next five days eating salads, bell peppers, cantaloupe, and other healthy produce, well above the recommended five servings per day.</p><p>My score did start to course-correct, but slowly. I looked into the benefits of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://now.tufts.edu/2024/09/30/benefits-raw-versus-cooked-vegetables">raw vs. cooked veggies</a> and realized that raw vegetables are high in vitamins and fiber but <em>low</em> in beta-carotenes. You get the most carotenoids from cooked vegetables paired with healthy fats, like cooking oil.</p><p>I'm more of a raw veggies guy than a stir-fry guy, which may be part of my problem. So I tried to incorporate more cooked veggies, paired with meats or peanut butter, during the final stretch.</p><div ><table><caption>My Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant index scores</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sunday</p></td><td  ><p>Monday</p></td><td  ><p>Tuesday</p></td><td  ><p>Wednesday</p></td><td  ><p>Thursday</p></td><td  ><p>Friday</p></td><td  ><p>Saturday</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>54</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>53</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>56</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>61</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>I climbed from an antioxidant index score of 53 (56% of recommended antioxidants) to 65 (80%) in a week.

I'm glad to have this tool as a baseline for my health.</p><p>Here's the main issue with the antioxidant index: there are more antioxidants than just carotenoids. Other types, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and lycopene, are found in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, beans, and teas, and they all help remove the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652">"free radical" molecules</a> that contribute to aging and disease.</p><p>Carotenoids are a key indicator of your health, one that helped me recognize a dietary deficiency. However, since Samsung cannot track other non-pigmented antioxidants as easily, your <em>actual</em> "antioxidant score" might be higher than Samsung can accurately assess with a smartwatch.</p><p>But this isn't a criticism!

If this is what's important for you, all you would need to decide is whether you want an Android phone or an iPhone.</p><p>However, neither of these phones outperforms many other models in terms of other key needs, such as affordability, AI capabilities, or a unique form factor. When we here at Android Central call them the best, we mean best at the things listed above.</p><p>Say you'd rather not spend more than a thousand dollars on a phone and want to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best value for your money</a>. Companies like Motorola and OnePlus offer phones that give you a lot to love at a much lower price. You can take this even further and look for the best phone you could buy for $500, and companies like Nothing or Xiaomi are great options. So are Samsung or OnePlus, which makes it a lot more difficult to decide.</p><p>Some criteria make it easier to determine a "best" model. You have a lot fewer choices when it comes to something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">a phone that folds or flips</a>.

It has a great price, it performs well, and it has a good set of features for its ~$500 price tag.

For me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Moto Razr</a> was a better choice, even though I think the OnePlus is better in many ways.

Maybe you want a cheap phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">a camera that takes great photos</a> without much fiddling around with settings.

Compared to previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> I've used in the past, this is easily the best, thanks to its sleek design, smooth performance, and surprisingly decent battery life. Yet, while the Fitbit integration is a nice perk of owning a Pixel Watch, there's one niche feature that keeps it from being my go-to gym smartwatch, and it's the reason why I constantly switch to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> when I work out.</p><p>The Pixel Watch does a great job tracking my workouts, especially my runs (when I actually do them), but it's not so great at keeping track when I lift weights. In fact, it's pretty rudimentary when compared to some other smartwatches, and frankly, I'm surprised that Google hasn't improved on this front with its flagship smartwatch. Heart rate, active calories, and cardio load are all there, but the one thing I <em>really </em>need is automatic rep counting.</p><p>This is something Garmin does very well; even Samsung manages this to some extent. With the focus on more running features in recent years, I would love to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> add rep counting to its repertoire.</p><h2 id="how-garmin-counts-reps-and-sets-2">How Garmin counts reps and sets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-workout-screen" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3603" height="2027" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I really like that Garmin can automatically count reps and start or stop sets. This means I don't have to manually do it every time; the watch does it for me. When I'm at the gym, I'm often lost in my music. While I'm not as serious as some of the other guys who jot down their every set in notebooks, I still like to stay on track with my workouts. That said, I often forget what rep or set I'm on, so it's nice to glance at my Garmin watch to check.</p><p>I don't know the ins and outs of how this works, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=xEPSpxE3j27gpEsiq8K9o8">Garmin states</a> that it can track "weight training exercises that consist of distinct and consistent motions, such as bench press," as well as "exercises designed to target single muscle groups/body parts." After performing the same movement a few times, it'll register that I am performing a set and will start counting my reps, retroactively adding my first reps to my current ones.</p><p>Once I stop performing those movements, the watch will automatically log that set and enter a resting period, complete with its own timer, so that I'm not over- or under-resting between sets. That rest period will stop once it notices that I've started performing repetitive movements again. Then it will start counting reps on a new set.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-workout-screen" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Things are much simpler on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which just tracks my workout without reps, sets, or rest periods. However, it can automatically detect certain activities, such as running and walking. I feel that Fitbit could utilize the same movement data for weightlifting reps, as Garmin does. Even if it isn't perfect, I think something would be better than nothing.</p><p>I'm not the only one who feels that Google could and should do better. Android Central senior editor Nicholas Sutrich also points out that his Amazfit watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions" target="_blank">makes his Pixel Watch feel like a toy</a>, with a major feature highlight being the ability to log and analyze reps as you work out. And like Garmin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">Amazfit</a> uses this data in a pretty useful way that Google could learn from.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-perfect-but-it-s-better-than-nothing-2">It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-edit-workout" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 edit workout set screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3597" height="2023" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the method isn't 100% accurate, Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> do a great job at it, and are either spot on with the counts or off by just one or (at most) two reps. However, if you do notice that something's off, Garmin lets you quickly edit the reps and even input the weight while it counts down to begin the rest period.</p><p>You can also edit the last set if you forget to, or go into the Garmin app to make any changes later.</p><p>It's also important to note that this feature typically only works on workouts where the watch can accurately track your movements. Garmin actually has a list of workouts that are more difficult to track with its watches, so it's important to keep this in mind if you plan to rely on this feature:</p><ul><li>Stationary wrist exercises: dips, pullups, pushups, planks</li><li>Leg isolated exercises: extensions, seated presses, calf raises, hamstring curls</li><li>Complex/hybrid motions: box jumps, “CrossFit” type exercises, burpees</li><li>Short-range exercises: shoulder shrugs</li><li>Battle ropes and jump rope</li></ul><p>In these cases, the watch often won't register that you're even doing anything and will continue to show you in a rest period. As a result, leg day is probably the only time when this feature is not reliable, aside from squats. However, they're generally reliable for weightlifting and can serve as a good alternative to pen and paper.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-counting-reps-it-s-so-much-more-2">It's not just counting reps. It's so much more</h2><p>While counting reps, Gamin actually takes this data even further. It uses that movement data to determine what exercises I'm doing. Then, after my workout, it shows me a diagram of the muscle groups that I worked out based on my movements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6" name="Garmin-targeted-muscles" alt="A visual of the targeted muscle groups in a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1224" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A visual of the targeted muscle groups during a workout session with primarily chest and tricep exercises. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Again, it's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty spot on most of the time, and it's a handy way to visualize my workouts and see which muscles got more focused than others, as well as what I may need to work on the next day or the following week.</p><p>Right now, I enjoy using Fitbit on the Pixel Watch, particularly for the AI-powered running coach, but the post-workout data is often pretty barebones. Adding more metrics like movement data and targeted muscle graphs would go a long way towards enhancing Fitbit for more people who could benefit from that data.</p><h2 id="learn-from-garmin-compete-with-samsung-2">Learn from Garmin, compete with Samsung</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo" name="Smartwatches-smart-ring-and-smart-glasses" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, Garmin Fenix 8, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Ultrahuman Ring Air, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Google announced the Pixel Watch 3, it was clear that there is more focus on running features and anything else, as if Google is trying to compete with Garmin to try and steal customers away from its popular Forerunner or Venu series. That may or may not be true, but I think Google should expand the scope of the Pixel Watch beyond just running.</p><p>I'm not saying Google shouldn't add more running features. By all means, I'm sure my colleague Michael Hicks would love to see more Garmin-like features on the Pixel Watch that cater to runners. That said, the Pixel Watch still can't compete with Garmin in terms of battery life or the sheer number of activity/sports modes.</p><p>However, Samsung is a good place to look, and I think Google should shift its focus to competing with the Galaxy Watch wherever it can.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Google-Pixel-Watch-glass.jpg" alt="Comparing the curved glass on a Google Pixel Watch with the flat glass on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I first bought my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-vs-5">Galaxy Watch 5</a> a few years ago, I was very surprised to see that it automatically counted my reps. This was before I had ever used a Garmin watch, so I was quite impressed to see this feature on a Wear OS watch. That said, it still left a lot to be desired.</p><p>At the gym, it would often count almost <em>any </em>movement as a rep, overestimating the count by quite a bit. It also wouldn't automatically start and stop sets, so I would have to do it manually; otherwise, every movement would count as a rep in a single set. Still, I appreciated that it at least <em>tried </em>to count my reps for me, even if the results were pretty inaccurate.</p><p>The feature was also limited to certain workouts, forcing you to change to specific exercises, whereas Garmin will log whatever you do based solely on your movements. There's no need to specify beforehand what workout you're about to do.</p><p>I haven't had the opportunity to test any newer Galaxy smartwatches, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but this is at least an area where Google can try to one-up Samsung's fitness efforts by learning from Garmin.</p><h2 id="improved-strength-training-in-the-works-2">Improved strength training in the works?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch may not have the battery life to compete with Garmin, but Google has access to a wealth of data and numerous ways to utilize it in ways that will benefit its consumers. I have complete faith that Google could bring features like automatic rep counting to the Pixel Watch, especially if it means giving users a more comprehensive look at their workouts.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Pixel Watch 4</a> right around the corner, I really hope Google throws us a bone and adds more features geared toward weightlifters and bodybuilders. Because, as it stands, I'm either going to continue to rely on Garmin for the gym, or I'll update my aging Galaxy Watch 5 to the Galaxy Watch 8 and make that my go-to smartwatch for everything.</p><p>Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-strength-training">a recent leak</a> suggests that Google may be looking to improve the strength training experience on the Pixel Watch 4. This may include features like a Workout Builder where users can curate their workouts, warm-ups, and cool-downs. It may also include real-time guidance, form insights, and advanced insights, which sounds a lot like what Garmin provides post-workout.</p><p>Whether or not automatic rep counting is included remains to be seen, but this sounds incredibly positive if it does launch with the Pixel Watch 4.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What exactly you’ll be able to repair, though, is still up in the air. It’s unclear if parts like the battery or cover glass will be replaceable through Google or its service partners.</p><p>This move doesn’t come out of nowhere. Back in September last year, a Google exec mentioned the team was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-repairability-leniency-pixel-watch-report">already “thinking through” how to make Pixel Watches</a>—and other devices—easier to repair. So, the latest Pixel Watch 4 report just seems to be that idea finally taking shape.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While more phones and smartwatches are moving toward repair-friendly designs these days, Google’s Pixel Watch has taken a different route.

While there's no word yet on how it'll actually work, this could be the upgrade that makes Pixel Watches truly competitive in the lifesaving tech department.</p><p>Furthermore, the smartwatch is rumored to add a Breathing Emergencies alert. It’ll use the built-in SpO2 sensor to keep tabs on your blood oxygen levels, and if they drop too low, the watch will send a warning to give you a heads-up on possible breathing issues.</p><p>Specs are still mostly under wraps, but these rumored upgrades are definitely ones to watch for when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Google takes the stage on August 20</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">demand climbing</a>, it’s shifting gears and looking to expand its backend setup and avoid putting all its eggs in Microsoft’s basket.</p><p>This marks the first big move in that shift. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, OpenAI is about to start running parts of ChatGPT on Google's cloud.

Even though it trails behind AWS and Azure, Google’s cloud setup will now help power OpenAI’s operations in the U.S., UK, Japan, the Netherlands, and Norway.</p><p>This change probably flies under the radar for most users, but it’s a pretty bold shift in strategy. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-plan-to-steal-chatgpts-market-share-is-all-about-geminis-free-tier">toe-to-toe with Google in the AI race</a>, is now buying compute power straight from Google. Both have spent billions pushing AI forward, competing in everything from chatbots to search, but now they’re sharing some of the same server space.</p><p>By spreading out its cloud partners, OpenAI avoids getting too tied to just one provider.

Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><p>The battery might also see a bump with a 5,015mAh capacity, a significant increase from the previous model, and will supposedly support 23W wired and 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging speeds.</p><p>The device's camera capabilities could remain the same this year; however, under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might get Google's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip.

With the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google</a> event set for August 20 and Galaxy Unpacked behind us, our attention now turns to see what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> will offer.</p><p>Of course, this won't be the only device announced at the event, as Google's entire flagship phone lineup is likely to see a refresh. And perhaps we'll even see a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch</a> along with some new smart home hardware. Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has arrived, it begs the question of whether you should wait for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold or not.</p><h2 id="what-changes-do-we-expect-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">What changes do we expect for the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold?</h2><p>Before we can make a suggestion, one way or another, we need to put the cards out on the table. Thankfully, leaks and rumors have given us a pretty good indication of what to expect, provided that they ring true. With that, here's a quick rundown of what the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to bring:</p><ul><li>Slightly larger and brighter cover display (6.3-inch/2,700 nits vs. 6.4-inch/3,000 nits).</li><li>The inner screen remains the same, with a potential bump in peak brightness.</li><li>Google Tensor G5 replaces the Tensor G4, potentially with 16GB of RAM.</li><li>Battery size rumored to increase to ~5,000mAh, and leaks suggest Qi2 compatibility with faster 15W wireless charging.</li><li>It could be the first foldable with an IP68 rating.</li><li>Minimal, if any, camera hardware changes are rumored.</li></ul><p>If the rumors prove true, we're in store for three major upgrades with the Pixel 10 Fold. And at least one of them comes as a huge surprise, especially given the recent slew of new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that have been released from Samsung, Honor, and Vivo.</p><h2 id="3-reasons-to-wait-2">3 reasons to wait</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first of which is the most obvious, with Google expected to introduce its Tensor G5.

Before that, the "standard" for foldable phones was an IPX8 rating, meaning that there was no dust protection. However, if Google can pull this off, we'd finally have a foldable phone that is fully protected against dust, managing to get in and wreak havoc.</p><p>And as a result, it might pave the way for more people to consider foldable phones in the future.

The current iteration retails for $1,799, but is often on sale for much less. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could come in at $1,599, matching that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/honor-magic-v5.html">Honor Magic V5's price</a> if you were to import one.</p><p>Provided that the price reduction comes to fruition, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is going to be even more enticing than before. Better performance, bigger battery, lower price, AND an IP68 rating? Yeah, I would definitely wait just a little bit longer for Google's official unveiling of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/the-breakthroughs-powering-samsungs-thinnest-most-refined-foldables/">a press release</a>, the company detailed the catalysts behind those refinements. The hinge is where Samsung states it started when it came to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. This third-generation Armor FlexHinge cut down the device's profile by roughly 27%, which also made it 43% lighter.</p><p>This new hinge is smaller; however, the post states it keeps the same strength as the bulkier hinge from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the Fold 6</a>. Another key upgrade is the hinge's wingplate, which Samsung says lets the display lie flatter when fully opened.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Lock Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display itself boosts Samsung's "flagship quality" even higher by reducing its thickness by 39%. However, the UTG, or ultra-thin glass, materials are 50% thicker. While these two statements might seem to contradict each other, the UTG upgrade helps to reduce the visibility of the phone's crease.</p><p>Hardware-wise, the Fold 7 drops its thickness by half over the series' first-ever launch, measuring 8.9mm when folded. Joining this is an even brighter display at a new 21:9 aspect ratio, which makes its experience much wider, too.</p><p>The Fold 7's camera array features a 200MP lens for the first time. Samsung said it worked to implement a new "thin actuator" and completely redesigned the camera's structure to fit the lens in without compromise.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-s-unsung-heroics-2">The Flip 7's Unsung Heroics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 might feel like an unspoken hero this year, but Samsung says it's reduced its profile to just 13.7mm when folded. That measurement drops even more to 6.5mm when the clamshell is opened. Arguably, the most talked-about aspect of the Flip 7 is its larger, immersive cover display.</p><p>The Flip 7 introduced an edge-to-edge display that wraps around its dual camera lenses. This results in a 4-inch cover screen, fully capable of letting users access AI features, check emails, watch videos, and more.</p><p>Another hidden gem is the device's bezels—they've gotten slimmer, too. Samsung claims the Flip 7 features "the world’s thinnest display bezel" on a foldable. Technically speaking, the phone saw a 68% reduction its its screen bezels, breathing life into its display experience.</p><p>Back when the foldables launched on July 9, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">did so without a notable aspect</a>: the S Pen. Samsung shed the S Pen (and its digitizer) on the device to help thin the phone even more. This is a feature that, while useful, not <em>many </em>people use. The S Pen was useful in various cases for those who loved it, and it'll likely be missed this year. However, there's a chance the S Pen could make a return on a future Z Fold series model.</p><p>Earlier this week, Samsung's executive director of the MX business division, Kang Min-seok, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">said the company may "reconsider"</a> bringing the S Pen back. This isn't an easy thing to do, according to Kang, as Samsung is thinking about investing R&D resources into "innovative tech" for a thinner S Pen. More importantly, Samsung says consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ea8d5033-0a00-4b56-b599-ddb4fbbea3a4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

After all, we&apos;re technically talking about four phones here — the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Will these devices get cheaper now that they&apos;re being supplanted by newer models, or will they simply be forgotten amidst all of the new-phone hubbub? Let&apos;s discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Earlier this week, Google confirmed that its next Made by Google event would be held on Wednesday, August 20th in New York City, with some sources suggesting that the keynote speech would start at 10am PT. </p><p>An official invite sent to some media outlets supposedly claimed that Google would be using the event to reveal new “Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.” This suggests that, in addition to the Pixel 10 series, we can expect to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, the Pixel Buds 2a, and possibly even Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review -" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to some recent leaks and rumors, Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a> and boast some upgraded camera tech, new displays, and the largest battery of any Pixel phone to date. The Pixel 10 Pro (and Pro XL) are also expected to receive a price increase of at least $100. As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, rumors have suggested that Google is working on a new hinge for its premium foldable, plus some upgraded camera tech and a boost in battery size. The Fold is also allegedly going to receive a $200 price increase, putting it at a steep $1,999.99, right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (don&apos;t get me started).</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-9-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel 9 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-hand-rear.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: will the Google Pixel 9 series get cheaper once the Pixel 10 is out? Well, I have some good news and (potentially) bad news. </p><p>The bad news is that the Google Pixel 9 (and 9 Pro, et al.) probably won&apos;t get an official price decrease once the new models are out, and it&apos;s just as likely that the 2024 flagships will actually become harder to find as the year progresses. After all, when was the last time you saw a Google Pixel 8 that wasn&apos;t refurbished? </p><p>The <em>good </em>news is that Google Pixel 9 deals are pretty easy to find right now. Just last week during Prime Day, we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/amazon-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2025">Pixel deals</a> that dropped the base model Pixel 9 to as low as $549, while carriers like Mint Mobile are currently slashing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>over 50% off the phone</strong></a> when you bundle with a wireless plan. </p><p>In other words, no, I don&apos;t expect the Pixel 9 to get a permanent price decrease when the Pixel 10 is revealed. But given the frequency of discounts on the Google Pixel 9 lineup, you don&apos;t necessarily need one. And don&apos;t forget: we&apos;ll also be seeing a lot of great Google Pixel 10 preorder deals once the flagship lineup is announced on August 20th, so you may be able to skip the last generation altogether. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="35af0509-f87b-4ab6-bf8f-35bd0b6556cc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>Although its soon to be replaced by the Pixel 10, the base model <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> continues to be one of Google's greatest creations, balancing a sleek, compact frame with powerful hardware and loads of AI-boosted smarts.

The Galaxy Watch 8 comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm. The 40mm variant has a 1.34-inch AMOLED screen, whereas the 44mm version has a 1.47-inch AMOLED panel. This means you can't use screen protectors designed for either model on the other.</p><p>With that in mind, the next thing to sort out is whether you want to use a case with your Watch 8 or not. Both sizes have decent case options that come with screen protectors bundled together, adding value. The Tensea 5+5Pack for Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Screen Protector Case 44mm, in particular, offers an insanely good bargain, giving you five robust 9H tempered glass protectors and five hard bumper cases together for just $10.</p><p>If you want to keep things simple, the SPGUARD 4 Pack is perfect for any user. Available in both 40mm and 44mm sizes, this four-pack gives you a cleaning kit as well as four robust pieces of tempered glass for about $8. It's the ideal kit, leaving you plenty of spares after the initial installation.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">best Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 bands</a> while you're shopping for your new Watch 8.

In their statement, the company said its PWM rate has dipped from 2,160Hz to 960Hz; however, this only goes into effect at low brightness. Nothing adds that while the display is still capable of the original rate (2,160Hz), this change should benefit the display's performance at lower brightness levels.</p><p>The spokesperson states, "...we found display performance at low brightness produces the best quality picture with this updated rate, so we have prioritised picture quality for the final retail software."</p><p>The reasoning for this, on a technical level, wasn't expressed by the Nothing spokesperson at this time. Sutrich states he is looking into it, but there wasn't anything concrete in time for publication. Curiously, this isn't the first time a company has decided to drop its PWM rate on a device for its final retail software. Google did this before, too, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">the Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Sutrich states that during the timeline around launch, the review unit he received used 480Hz PWM. Once the final rate software was released, things dipped to 240Hz.</p><h2 id="in-the-interest-of-your-eyes-2">In the interest of your eyes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4" name="pwm-hero-01" alt="Comparing the dimming technologies between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, iPhone 14 Pro Max, OnePlus 13, and Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PWM, otherwise known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">pulse width modulation</a>," is a technology used by brands to rapidly turn the display on and off to trick your eyes into thinking the screen's brighter or dimmer. It's this flickering that can cause grueling problems for people who are PWM sensitive. Some people can suffer from eye straight, headaches, dizziness, a sense of vertigo, nausea, and a whole host of other uncomfortable feelings.</p><p>There are some solutions if you've felt anything like this after using your phone for a while. Sutrich suggests locking your phone's display refresh rate, not using it in a completely dark room, and (probably most importantly) visiting the optometrist.</p><p>While the Phone 3's 2,160Hz PWM rate is eye-friendly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">the Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a> also received similar treatment.</p><p>Nothing's confirmation of its PWM rate change comes shortly after the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/open-sales-nothing-phone-3-and-headphone-1-begin-us-canada">open sales began</a> for the Phone 3 in the U.S. The device starts at $799 with 12/256GB and a 16/512GB RAM/storage configs. Nothing said it has leaned into the flagship appeal of the phone, popping in the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip with 50MP camera lenses and a 5,150mAh battery.</p><p>Around launch, Nothing confirmed that it has committed to even more software updates for the Phone 3. The device will receive five major Android OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="129a5abb-f1c9-4c72-b395-be3c50cbb3e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YePoe5yoNNw8rzpgquX8dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the white Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 is Nothing's "true flagship," boasting notable CPU and GPU improvements over the company's past-gen model.

Samsung is working on smart glasses, and the company's Food Plus service offers a useful alternative to MyFitnessPal.</p><p>Discussing the feature with a Samsung executive on a small panel, it was clear that the potential for this feature is huge, especially as additional form factors become mainstream and the camera-enabled Samsung Smart Fridge evolves.</p><h2 id="vascular-load-while-asleep-2">Vascular load while asleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic BioActive Sensors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second hero feature is the new Vascular load measurement that occurs while you sleep. Although it may not sound as impressive as the immediacy and quantifiable metrics provided by other features, this could be one of the most important additions to the lineup.</p><p>The majority of cardiac and Vascular infarctions occur while you're asleep, as this is when major underlying health conditions can be most apparent. The stress on my heart culminated in a heart attack five years ago, and recovery involved careful monitoring - in the hospital and at home - of my Vascular system, as a 95% blockage was the root cause.</p><p>The new vascular load feature is designed to measure and monitor whether your heart is pumping blood through your arteries efficiently. It measures the resistance to blood flow (resistive load) and the stiffness of the arteries (pulsatile load) to determine whether your heart is working properly. Too much pressure or too stiff arteries can lead to more serious conditions, including heart failure like mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA" name="Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-July-2025-Galaxy-Watch8-Series-Classic-Ultra-Comfort-PR_main3-F" alt="Vascular Load on the Galaxy Watch 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the type of feature that many people won't need, but for those who do, it could prove to be lifesaving. Had this feature existed five years ago when I had my heart attack, I have little doubt that it could have alerted me to underlying problems and prompted me to seek medical advice before the heart attack occurred.</p><p>Every wearable maker offers some form of cardio monitoring, but far fewer offer to track the stress on your heart. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> does track your cardio load, but not specifically while asleep. The Galaxy Watch 8 is unique in this regard, but I hope I never need to use this feature.</p><h2 id="a-new-holistic-era-for-health-2">A new holistic era for health </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UUzgZSsfbkWiBwEQGgP7CL" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-2" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUzgZSsfbkWiBwEQGgP7CL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These new features are the latest additions to a long line of features designed to provide a single place to track your health data and offer a holistic overview, complete with personalized recommendations.</p><p>They aren't the only new features, however, as the same executive panel saw Samsung reveal that the Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to identify an ectopic heartbeat as one of the possible ECG results.

The Galaxy Watch 7 and all the smartwatches that came before it supported quick-release bands, so you had as many options as there are drops of water in the ocean. With the change to Dynamic Lug connectors, the new Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic have a far narrower selection of bands. Nonetheless, what's available right now isn't bad.</p><p>Samsung's Watch 8 Classic Sport Band is an ideal partner for the smartwatch. It's easily adjustable, fairly durable, and made of pretty soft rubber that also happens to be waterproof. Plus, there are five different colors to choose from. It's always nice to have a spare rubber or silicone band to match your casual outfit of the day.</p><p>For dressier occasions, consider a leather wristband or a classy metal band. Whether you're a leather person or a steel person, there are great options for both types. For instance, the SPGUARD Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic Stainless Steel Strap is adjustable, comes in two colors, and it's really durable. The links are removable, and the stainless steel clasp offers a snug, secure fit. Since it's made of stainless steel, exposure to water is no issue at all. This isn't the case with leather options, as water destroys leather goods. Sankel's Watch 8 Classic Genuine Leather Band weathers with age, giving it that dashing texture only real leather can deliver.</p><p>And if you can't choose between the two, why not get both? The YEEJOK Metal+Leather Watch Straps two-pack gives you both, though the leather is most likely not genuine. Regardless, it's a fantastic deal for the price of a single watch band, and you get two different styles!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that Samsung officially registered a new device under the name "Galaxy Z Trifold" earlier this week in South Korea.</p><p>Earlier leaks have suggested that this device could be called the G Fold, based on the way the hinges would work, allowing the device to close inward. However, it might not be the case.</p><p>It seems like the company has applied for a trademark certification on the name, which could mean that the company might stick to the same name at least in its domestic market. "After all, the first version will only be released in South Korea, and perhaps China – but not in Europe or the US," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-trifold/">Galaxy Club added.</a></p><p>Whether or not Samsung keeps the name, this trademark registration reveals that the device might show up in the Galaxy Z lineup, and the word "trifold" indicates the presence of two hinges, as seen in previous rumors about the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website also adds that the trifold has been given a model number SM-F968N and the internal codename Q7M. And the phone is steadily moving towards a year-end launch. This was backed by another recent mention of the trifold, right from the source itself.</p><p>Samsung's acting head of the device experience division, TM Roh, said during a press interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says" target="_blank">The Korea Times</a> that the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year." Roh spoke about those Galaxy trifold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet. Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't give us any other specifications or features about the tri-fold.</p><p>So far, rumors have indicated that this phone will allegedly fold inward, feature a massive 10-inch display when unfolded, and a slightly thicker build when compared to Huawei's tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>. The external display could measure about 6.49 inches, but might not support the S-Pen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">just like the latest Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Apart from those hardware aspects, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak" target="_blank">recent leak</a> showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 </a>animations on the alleged trifold device, including its functions. One animation demonstrates the trifold's folding process, where the left-most portion opens, revealing its full display.</p><p>The animation shows that two hinges fold inward, but the left and right panels are of different sizes. The former is much smaller, meaning that it needs to be folded first. This is backed up by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><p>That said, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-concept-fully-revealed-showcase">may have beaten Samsung to the punch</a> and unveiled its Phantom Ultimate G Fold concept today (July 17). The phone sports a "G-style" inward folding design with two hinges, with a thickness that is "comparable" to a regular book-style phone (think Z Fold 7), but its open state measures 3.49mm thin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Just one tap, and your pinned favorites were all right there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Last month’s leak displayed an “Add” button at the end of the favorites row, likely meant for quickly adding more contacts. But in the official rollout, that button is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The refreshed design leaves the bottom bar looking a bit bare, with only “Recents” and “Contacts” left standing. While the layout feels cleaner, it comes at a cost, as Google quietly dropped the “Frequents” section.

T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is meant for folks who need something flexible and cheap, without a bunch of hidden fees or a complicated multi-year contract. In that regard, it&apos;s an awesome service. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2001px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.73%;"><img id="rSi2zXfYHKogaSYyy8izka" name="t-mobile-5g-home-internet-plans-169.jpg" alt="A graph showing details behind T-Mobile's 5G Home Internet plans" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSi2zXfYHKogaSYyy8izka.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2001" height="975" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Rely plan starts at $50 per month using AutoPay (or $35 per month when you bundle with a wireless line), while the Amplified plan costs $60 per month using AutoPay ($45 when you bundle). The best internet plan, called All-In, is also the most expensive, starting at $70 with AutoPay or $55 when you bundle with voice.</p><p>All taxes and fees are included in the price, and again, there are no monthly equipment fees or no pesky annual contracts to worry about when you get your bill. If you&apos;re not totally sold on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet, you can also test drive the service for 15 days and get all of your money back if you&apos;re not feeling it. T-Mo will even pay for the shipping. Needless to say, there are plenty of good reasons to consider T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet if it&apos;s available in your area. The free Mastercard is just the cherry on top. </p> ]]></dc:content>
