That’s the wild promise of Meta’s latest research, and it’s not some distant sci-fi dream.</p><p>Thanks to a new study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09255-w" target="_blank">published in Nature</a>, we’re getting a sneak peek at how augmented reality (AR) glasses could soon read your intentions before you even fully act on them.</p><p>Meta’s Reality Labs has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/reality-labs-surface-emg-research-nature-publication-ar-glasses-orion/" target="_blank">quietly working</a> on a tech called surface electromyography (sEMG), which sounds complicated but boils down to one simple idea: detecting the tiny electrical signals your muscles send when you even think about moving.</p><h2 id="how-it-works-wristwear-that-reads-intention-2">How it works: wristwear that reads intention</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xrK6Ed6uZB93yehYCzZC23" name="Meta-sEMG-hand-gesture" alt="Meta sEMG hand gestures" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrK6Ed6uZB93yehYCzZC23.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of waving your arms around or using a bulky controller, you slip on a lightweight armband. Trained on data from thousands of people, the system deciphers minute electrical patterns that the brain sends to your fingers.</p><p>One test user typed at over 20 words per minute just thinking the stroke motions. The team smashed the key hurdles: generalization across users (so it doesn’t need per‑person calibration), consistent gesture recognition, and handwriting decoding, all embedded in a wristband-style interface.</p><p>The big deal here is speed and subtlety. Current AR controls rely on voice, hand tracking (needs big gestures), or clunky remotes. In its Nature paper, Meta showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion</a>, a prototype wristband that predicted gestures with scary accuracy, even when people barely moved. It worked while typing on a keyboard or holding a coffee without needing to pause your life to interact with tech.</p><p>Meta sees this fusion of AI, sEMG wristband, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">AR glasses</a> as the natural next step beyond smartphones.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2><p>The tech is a big step forward for interacting with devices, especially for people with limited mobility since it doesn’t require any physical movement to trigger input. It also makes using tech feel more natural and less effortful.</p><p>That said, it’s still early days. Orion glasses reportedly cost around $10,000 per unit and aren’t available to the public yet. The wristband, while extremely promising, is still in prototype phase with no clear timeline for a commercial launch.</p><p>But Meta says it's working toward more affordable, consumer-ready versions of both, and the progress so far suggests it's serious.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some Google Home and Nest speakers have gone even longer without any hardware changes, or have been discontinued.</p><p>Google launched the Pixel Tablet in 2023 as a hybrid between a smart home manager and a casual Android tablet, but it hasn't been a replacement for the Nest Hub line. It did release a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat last year</a>, and conversely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">dropped support for the first two Nest Learning Thermostat models</a> entirely this year.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We hear you loud and clear and are committed to getting this right -- and making sure we have a long term solution that provides better reliability and capability.

Meanwhile, Android phones and tablets, Wear OS watches, and ChromeOS devices can all use Gemini over Assistant.</p><p>A new post complaining about Home and Nest troubles seemingly pops up on social media every few days, with this one on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1m5ygut/the_enshittification_of_google_home/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=action_bar&embed_host_url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-promises-a-smart-home-fix-apologizes-for-assistant-troubles" target="_blank">Reddit</a> garnering nearly 300 comments in three days.

Unfortunately, they'll have to wait until Fall 2025 to get a proper fix — which may include Gemini support for smart speakers and displays, according to rumors.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that while "poking around the Google Play Store app," likely through its APK/code, the tipster was able to surface a snapshot of the Pixel 10 series in full.</p><p>The photo shows the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> model leading off from the right in a rumored "indigo," followed by the Pixel 10 Pro, the 10 Pro Fold, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL. From this imagery, it <em>seemingly </em>doubles down on previous rumors about the vanilla Pixel 10 model picking up a third lens.</p><p>However, the "Meet the new Pixel 10 series" leaked advertisement on the Play Store supposedly suggests another aspect: the inclusion of a $50 off deal on a device in the series. There's nothing more concrete beyond that, considering this was leveraged from within the app itself—and the series isn't out yet. This will likely appear sometime after the series' debut in August, as the publication also speculates.</p><p>Whatever this promotion entails is seemingly prepared to run until October 13. It's just the start date we're left wondering about.</p><h2 id="here-comes-10-2">Here comes 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recently, rumors have been swirling about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">the Pixel 10 series' colors</a>. Supposedly, the base model is arriving in Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Lemongrass. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are said to feature Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade.

Meta states the experience Quest users will find through their VR headsets mirrors what you'd find on your phone or computer. After signing in (or signing up), users will find their saved selection of favorite tracks and playlists via their Meta Quest headset.</p><p>Users can also create entirely new playlists through their headset, alongside music controls. Meta states users can easily switch songs and adjust their volume "without interrupting the fun."</p><p>Aside from music, Meta states its Quest headsets support Spotify's podcasts, meaning you can "listen or watch" directly from the app in VR. Another major highlight is Spotify's Quest integration lets users have their tunes playing in the background while in other apps. It's giving classic Xbox 360 and (newer-gen) PlayStation vibes. As an example, Meta states your songs in Spotify will continue playing while you're "gaming, working out, or making a virtual painting" with your Quest.</p><p>If you're unsure where to begin, Meta suggests checking out Spotify's Discover Weekly, Songs of Summer, or Summer Throwbacks playlists. Android Central has spotted the Spotify app on the Meta Quest's app store as of early this afternoon with a small 2.31MB download size.</p><h2 id="do-more-and-jam-while-you-do-2">Do More, and jam while you do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multiple-windows" alt="Using a Meta Quest 3 with six windows open at once" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you missed it, Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-discover-weekly-turns-10-birthday-update-bash">Discover Weekly recently turned 10</a>. To celebrate, the platform gifted its users with two updates: a revamped playlist design and the ability to "guide" Discover Weekly to the tunes and vibes you'd rather hear.</p><p>One of the things Meta mentioned during the Spotify app's integration is "Multiple screens + ambient audio = bliss." The company has continued to refine its Quest Horizon UI, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">the company's CTO discussed last year</a>. Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO, mentioned the company's interest last year behind "reworking the core UI infrastructure in order to enable a richer environment."</p><p>A major part of this rework was giving the user the ability to move their windows to any spot while in mixed reality.</p><p>There was a feature that arrived last year, in the name of enrichment, called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">Travel Mode</a>." Meta stated it wanted to position its headsets as the "ultimate in-flight entertainment device." Travel Mode is essentially a private space for users looking to game, watch their own content, or anything else while on a flight.

Fady Mishriki, chair of the WPC’s Board of Directors, stated, "Consumers will be delighted when they experience Qi2 25W as it delivers nearly 70% more power than the original Qi2. The number of devices in the Qi2 25W certification queue for launch is unprecedented, as is the quality and breadth of our members’ product designs."</p><p>Piggybacking off Mishriki's statement, the WPC reports that its Qi2 25W wireless charging version solves a problem many smartphone OEMs struggled with: fast-charging protocols. It also solves a major critique consumers have reported to the WPC, which regards faster wireless charging, as we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">previously limited to 15W</a>.</p><p>Now, two years later, the WPC says it has launched a new protocol/version that can "enable truly high-speed Qi-certified wireless charging" for phone makers and consumers.</p><p>While iPhones are involved in this, the WPC announces that "major Android smartphones" will also join Qi2 officially. The post states "14 devices, receivers, and transmitters" have already received certification for Qi2 25W. However, there's more to come, as the WPC states "full-scale" certification has opened for an even larger influx of devices awaiting Qi2 25W certification.</p><h2 id="qi2-is-headed-for-more-android-phones-2">Qi2 is headed for more Android phones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-options-1" alt="Various cases for the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The WPC's announcement didn't tease when consumers could see new devices launching with Qi2 25W, as that's likely up to the manufacturers. We're stepping into the second half of the year, so there's a chance we'll begin noticing these devices pop up more and more, and even more considerably in 2026.</p><p>Android users have been waiting on this since January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">when the WPC stated</a> consumers would see an "acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025." During this time, Samsung and Google truly buckled down and got aboard the Qi2 wireless charging train with the WPC. Per Samsung, "You can expect to see Android devices supporting Qi2 from Samsung Galaxy devices in 2025."</p><p>We've already seen that with the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which supports Qi2 at 15W (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">though it lacks the magnets internally</a>).</p><p>The other side of this is Google, which has become "committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard." The company also solidified itself as a notable assistant to the WPC in developing its Qi2 v2.2 standard that we're seeing announced currently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Rumors and leaks currently point to the Google Pixel 10 lineup fully supporting Qi2 and MagSafe with inbuilt magnets, complemented by a new "Pixelsnap"  line of accessories.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-qi2-support-on-the-google-pixel-10-2">Everything you need to know about Qi2 support on the Google Pixel 10</h2><p>The Qi2 wireless charging standard is available with or without the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP). Phones with the MPP have built-in magnets that connect with Qi2 or MagSafe chargers and accessories. Those without magnets inside can only support Qi2 Ready, which requires a magnetic case to unlock full magnetic alignment. For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">the Samsung Galaxy S25 series supports Qi2 Ready</a>, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> includes magnets for the complete experience.</p><p>Google could take either route with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>. It elected not to include magnets inside the Pixel 9 series, which was announced in August 2024. Then, in January 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Google said</a> it is "committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard and increasing the penetration of Qi2 into Android handsets and other devices." It played a role in the development of the Qi2.2.1 specification, released July 23, 2025, which adds 25W wireless charging support.</p><p>The Wireless Power Consortium is responsible for managing the Qi wireless charging standard, and it said "major Android smartphones" will support Qi2 25W — also known as Qi2.2.1.</p><p>Being that Google is set to release the Pixel 10 lineup in August and helped create Qi2 25W, there is a strong reason to believe its upcoming phones will feature built-in magnets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BntYCSHrjCWfDA6jN3mXc4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BntYCSHrjCWfDA6jN3mXc4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An early release Google Pixel 10 Pro XL case with a Qi2 magnet array inside.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adding to the likelihood of a Pixel 10 lineup with magnets inside is the rumors of Google selling first-party magnetic accessories. Google is said to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">readying a "Pixelsnap" lineup of Qi2 accessories</a> for the Pixel 10 launch, and that's as good of a sign as any that it plans to fully support magnetic Qi2.</p><p>On top of that, every Google Pixel 10 model is rumored to be heavier than its Pixel 9 counterpart. Only one model — the Pixel 10 Pro XL — will match the thickness of the phone it is replacing; the rest are getting heavier. A thicker and heavier Pixel 10 lineup is perplexing, but the addition of magnets inside could help explain the discrepancy.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">what Google announces at the Made by Google event</a> set for Aug. 20 to be sure. For now, signs are pointing to the Pixel 10 series being the first to include built-in magnetic charging support.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="878fd9be-df7f-4dc9-8f6b-b71b598d4857">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yp5tTetz8vxwvnmVisSQuj.jpg' alt="UGREEN Uno Charger 65W charger "></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ugreen Uno 65 charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The perfect Pixel 10 accessory</strong></em></p><p>Looking to upgrade your charging setup before upgrading to the Google Pixel 10?

Until then, rumors and leaks give us a hint about how fast we can expect the Google Pixel 10 lineup to charge. Keep in mind that until they're made official, these figures could change or turn out to be incorrect.</p><p>The base-model Pixel 10 will charge at 29W with a cable, according to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-specs" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report. That's up slightly from the 27W rate supported by the Google Pixel 9. The faster charging speed reportedly coincides with more battery capacity. The upcoming model is said to ship with a 4,970mAh battery, which is an increase of 270mAh compared to the current one.</p><p>These same charging speeds are supported by the Google Pixel 10 Pro. The larger and most expensive handset, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, will get the fastest charging speeds. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to charge at up to 39W with a cable.

There haven't been a ton of leaks for the 10 Pro Fold, but what we know about it so far, it should bring some key upgrades to the processor, battery size, and cameras. If you didn't buy the 9 Pro Fold in 2024, does it make sense to wait for the 10 Pro Fold before you decide?</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> was a solid phone, and it still is, but it also lacked some key features that made it a bit too expensive to consider. The lukewarm processor performance, underwhelming cameras, and the fact that it only has an IPX8 rating means it's not exactly dustproof. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to address all these shortcomings, and a few more. Let's see what we know about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold so far and which one is a better choice.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Half-Opened.jpeg" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold half-opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the many rumors and leaked renders of the Pixel 10 series, we don't have much physical proof that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold exists, but one can make an educated guess that it's in the works. We're not expecting any major redesigns here as it should look largely the same as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. We do hope that Google makes it slimmer and lighter, now that Samsung has finally caved and got with the program. The outer display on the 10 Pro Fold is expected to be slightly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-specs">larger at 6.4 inches</a>, which means it could be a bit wider or taller, depending on how Google plays with the aspect ratio.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold weighed a hefty 257 grams and was 10.5mm thick when folded. The design and ergonomics were very good, but there's no escaping that weight. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to have a new hinge design, which would also make the crease on the folding display less prominent. We're hoping these changes drop the weight of the phone to something closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="8kTUfssJKYiZ6JZLTWBch9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-06.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8kTUfssJKYiZ6JZLTWBch9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold had a 6.3-inch Full-HD+ outer OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,700 nits of peak brightness. This brightness level is expected to be higher on the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The folding display will mostly stay the same as the one on the 9 Pro Fold, which is an 8-inch LTPO OLED with the same brightness level as the outer screen.</p><p>Some notable improvements to the display which we can expect the 10 Pro Fold to have would be narrower bezels, higher brightness, a more power-efficient OLED panel, and sturdier ultrathin glass (UTG) for better scratch protection. To be honest, we didn't face any real legibility issues when using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's displays in our review, so we're sure the 10 Pro Fold will have the same, if not better, displays.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2Vuy6HhXHjqdUKgF9mHyc8" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-studio-download-model.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold showing Pixel Studio Downloading Model prompt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Vuy6HhXHjqdUKgF9mHyc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pricing for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is another aspect where we don't have any real information on, yet. Since the rest of the Pixel 10 series is not expected to get any bump in price, let's assume for a moment that the 10 Pro Fold will also start at $1,799 for the 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. We're also expecting a third storage tier this time of 1TB, which will push the pricing well beyond $2,000. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold came in just two colors and we're expecting something similar for the 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>The big change we're all excited for is the shift to the new Tensor G5 SoC. The entire Pixel 10 series will be using it, and it should finally be able to match up (or get closer to) Qualcomm's Elite chip. The G5 will be using a smaller 3nm process node and will be made by TSMC rather than Samsung. This should finally put to rest the overheating and poor raw performance that have been plaguing Pixels for years.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 2700 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 2700 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outer display</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 2700 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 2700 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover + folding screen cameras</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IPX8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,650mAh, 21W wired charging, 7.5W Qi wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded/ unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5mm / 155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is slated to get a big boost in battery capacity to 5,015mAh, making it the largest battery yet in a Pixel foldable. The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> still beats it by a small margin though, thanks to its 5,100mAh battery. Hopefully, we see an increase in charging speeds too, especially for wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold had a 4,650mAh battery, and it delivered above-average battery life for a folding phone. With the power-efficiency enhancements to Tensor G5 and a larger battery, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could easily have the best battery life of any Pixel yet.</p><p>The cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold were disappointing since they were the same sensors lifted from the Pixel Fold, with the only tweaks being software-related. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might have similar resolution sensors, but Google is expected to overhaul the hardware and make it more competitive with the competition.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, just like the rest of the 10 series.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold launched with Android 14 and will be getting the same number of years of updates, but the 10 Pro Fold should outlast the 9 Pro Fold by two Android versions.</p><p>We don't know yet what exclusive AI features will be offered with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but rest assured that there will be many.

The Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses were a turning point for smart glasses as a product category, and depending on what Meta decides to release under the Ray-Ban name, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) could be the next revolution.</p><p>This year has brought a bevy of leaks for Meta's next-generation smart glasses. We've heard everything from Meta branching out to make separate styles for sunglasses and prescription glasses, to a third tier with a display in one of the lenses.</p><p>Whatever happens this year, we're expecting big things from Meta, as the company seems to shy away from the typical annual product release cycle and only releases hardware when something worthwhile is ready. Here's everything we know about Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) so far.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-price-and-availability"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From what we know so far, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) will ship in two main styles: Optical and Sunglasses. If this is the case, it would be an interesting new direction as Meta has always provided the same types of lenses for each style of glasses it launches. Even the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-and-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-built-for-athletes-and-they-look-insane">Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses</a> feature multiple styles with the same lens options.</p><p>There's no word on price differences for these two models just yet, but previous pairs of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have cost between $299-$349, depending on style and lenses chosen. Prescription lenses typically add extra cost.</p><p>Based on leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">from the XR Research Institute</a>, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) should arrive by the end of 2025. If so, we expect them to be unveiled at Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-design-and-features"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Design and features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AajrrkPS4dJA4EWfGjXaMJ" name="ray-ban-meta-3-optical-leak-16x9" alt="Leaked renders of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AajrrkPS4dJA4EWfGjXaMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We think Meta is breaking its third-generation Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses into two styles so that they can support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">a wider range of prescription lenses</a> than the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses offer. The current frames can't properly fit certain lenses, so having a separate design for optical versus sunglasses would solve this problem.</p><p>So far, we've seen two leaks pointing toward Meta launching dual designs for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) called "Aperol" and "Bellini." Both styles are reportedly going to receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">next-generation Meta AI assistant</a>, which will be able to run for hours at a time rather than the current 30-minute limit.</p><p>This is almost certainly designed to go head-to-head with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR smart glasses</a>, which, as Google demonstrated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-are-a-mess-but-android-xr-should-finally-fix-that">on stage at Google I/O 2025</a>, can record live for long periods and remember things for you. One of the most commonly cited uses is helping remember where you left your wallet or car keys by asking the AI assistant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to that, next-generation Meta AI on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) is said to be able to recognize faces. That can be useful in any place where you've met someone before but can't remember their name.</p><p>We're also expecting much better battery life based on these examples, plus the information found in leaks to date. Our Oakley Meta HSTN camera review showed that Meta has nearly doubled battery life compared to Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, despite using the same chipset.</p><p>If Meta can pack in the latest Qualcomm AR1+ Gen 1 chipset into Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), it's entirely possible that battery life will eclipse Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses by quite a bit.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-glasses-with-a-screen"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Glasses with a screen?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For months now, we've seen leaks about an upcoming pair of Meta smart glasses that feature a screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">in one of the lenses</a>. While I used a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses for the mockup you see above, this new pair of display-equipped Meta smart glasses may look closer to the thicker frames of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> than existing Ray-Ban Smart Glasses.</p><p>These display-equipped glasses are currently known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">Meta Hypernova</a>, but it's not clear if Meta will be using the Ray-Ban branding or another brand altogether. Meta currently owns 3% of EssilorLuxottica <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meta-takes-around-3-stake-ray-ban-parent-essilorluxottica-source-says-2025-07-08/">as of July 9, 2025</a>, so we expect both companies to continue to leverage the many different brands as a way to better market upcoming smart glasses.</p><p>Hypernova is said to feature a single display placed inside one lens and will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">an sEMG bracelet</a> to make controlling the glasses effortless. This bracelet makes it possible to use smartphone-like gestures with your hands, but without the need to touch floating virtual objects as you might on a VR headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynpJa4DMH4ycUFVW67DfTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-02" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynpJa4DMH4ycUFVW67DfTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, the bracelet understands how the muscles in your wrist relate to your finger movements and can accurately translate that into clicks, pinches, and even typing based on how you're holding your hand. It also means you can easily look at an icon on the glasses' screen and pinch your fingers to open an app, even if your hands are resting in your lap.</p><p>The sEMG bracelet I used during my Meta Orion hands-on had haptic feedback, as well, so it felt like I was physically interacting with virtual objects, even though they weren't "real." You can see the bracelet on me in the photo above.</p><p>We don't know exactly when Hypernova will launch or what the price tag will be, but the rumor is that it could debut sometime late this year or early 2026 with a price tag well above the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of playing on the same screen or even on the same platform, one player uses a smartphone app while the other is fully immersed on a Meta Quest headset.</p><p>Despite the VR player doing "most" of the work, there are very few moments of downtime for the smartphone player. In VR, the game always begins in the desert just outside of the facility you're supposed to enter. The player on the smartphone begins by opening the van door for the VR player so they can fill up their "power glove," as I'll call it.</p><p>Aside from vaguely resembling the NES Power Glove accessory, the glove you wear in VR holds a small amount of liquid electricity that's used to power the puzzles you come across in the game. Once your glove is full, you'll turn around and head to the facility where the smartphone player will have to "hack" the elevator to send you underground.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v3LUNLwiXmbQA3SEVA2jqJ" name="elsewhere-electric-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot for Elsewhere Electric, showing a mysterious room with green lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3LUNLwiXmbQA3SEVA2jqJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Games by Stitch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most puzzles in the beginning of the game revolve around the two players decoding strange symbols to activate a station of some kind. The VR player sees each symbol at a station, and the smartphone player has a list of several pages of symbols to choose from. Since the smartphone player never sees exactly what the VR player sees, you'll need to work on your communication skills to accurately describe what you see.</p><p>Right off the bat, I noticed that most gamers I played this with were able to figure out how the game works in a matter of minutes. The smartphone UI is the hardest part to understand, as there's no explanation offered for what you're supposed to do. Poking around will reveal flashing icons that should be pressed from time to time, but this is never particularly obvious.</p><p>I played the game with my son and with a few other non-gamers, and all of them had the same frustrations. Without me specifically showing them what to click and where to go, they got annoyed enough to quit before helping me solve more than a few puzzles. Developer Games by Stitch has a nice walkthrough for the first few floors in the YouTube video below, but it's a long video that could have been shortened to a few prompts in an intro tutorial.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tf98e_av2jg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you have the patience to get through the first three or four floors, you'll be greeted with one of the coolest co-op games I've <em>ever</em> played. The style of this game is wholly unique, in my experience, and while it feels familiar at times, it never feels like more than maybe an homage to something amazing.</p><p>The 1970s-esque technology and decor found throughout the facility, plus the groovy soundtrack, lend to the already strange and palpably thick atmosphere. This place feels eerie, yet somehow comforting, in a way the vacant halls of Severance do on a happy day in the office.</p><p>That is, of course, until you come across your first invisible enemy. No doubt, the smartphone player will notice something amiss first, as a strange creature lurking behind the glass on the first floor can't be spotted by the VR player. If the pieces don't connect by the second area of floor 2, your VR friend is in trouble.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qAXZDDwdV6KLVj6cvqV5sJ" name="elsewhere-electric-official-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot for Elsewhere Electric, showing a yellow room with shelves of tapes on them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAXZDDwdV6KLVj6cvqV5sJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Games by Stitch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, Elsewhere Electric requires the patience of a game like Dark Souls, as you'll often die or fail an area only to have to come back and try it again. As with any puzzle room game, you'll get through the area faster in subsequent attempts. Thankfully, though, this isn't rogue-like and you'll never have to solve the same room twice once you progress beyond it. The elevator always takes you to the most recent floor.</p><p>I dare not reveal too many of the game's secrets for fear of spoiling some of the coolest things you'll encounter in your time, but I will say that you need to be in the right mood to play this game. It's one that uniquely hinges on quality communication, patience, and teamwork in a way I've never seen from co-op games.</p><p>In a way, only the Biped series of games requires this much constant teamwork and, even then, it's a very different kind of teamwork from what's expected of players in Elsewhere Electric. The only thing I want to see changed is the addition of a tutorial section. If Games by Stitch can get that added in a post-release update, this will easily be puzzle game of the year for me.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Interestingly enough, the phones I used the most in 2025 featured the Dimensity 9400, and it goes to show the amount of progress MediaTek made over the last two years.</p><p>Qualcomm is still in a dominant position in the high-end category, but MediaTek netted significant design wins, notably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>. These are two of the best camera-centric phones available today, and they're both powered by the Dimensity 9400.</p><p>Even though MediaTek is using regular Arm cores — Qualcomm switched to a custom design this year — there really isn't much of a difference. The X200 Pro takes the best photos of any phone I used until now, and it does a great job in demanding games. It holds up incredibly well in mundane situations as well, and I didn't see any differences when using on-device AI utilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZYcsJaGSFJFsUjMT8tuutD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcsJaGSFJFsUjMT8tuutD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With MediaTek also shifting to the 3nm node, there's no difference in efficiency either, and if anything, I got better battery life out of the X200 Pro than Qualcomm-based devices with a similar battery size. That isn't to say that Qualcomm is lagging behind; the 8 Elite is clearly one of the fastest mobile platforms available today, and it's good to see MediaTek offering an alternative.</p><p>It's clear that Chinese manufacturers want to use both MediaTek and Qualcomm designs in their phones; while the X200 Pro has the Dimensity 9400, Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a> is powered by Qualcomm, and the same is true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> as well. However, these devices are limited to China, and that continues to be annoying.</p><p>What I'm trying to say is that MediaTek is somehow able to catch up to Qualcomm in the high-end category, and that's great news for the industry as a whole. With Samsung failing to make ground with Exynos and Huawei severely hobbled by trade restrictions, there is a distinct dearth of rivalry when it comes to mobile platforms, and it's good to see MediaTek utilizing its momentum to rival Qualcomm in this area.</p><p>MediaTek is making decent inroads into the U.S. as well, something it has struggled to do in the past. Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 tablets are powered by the Dimensity 9300+, and while these devices won't sell in as many numbers as the brand's phones, the fact that the manufacturer is using MediaTek-based designs globally is a huge endorsement.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EsXP28Ys32snGzfevsFTW3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsXP28Ys32snGzfevsFTW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, MediaTek still doesn't have a foothold with foldables — all the foldables I used in 2025 are powered by Qualcomm. We may get to see Chinese manufacturers using next-gen Dimensity platforms, but that may be a few years away. It's evident that MediaTek wants to continue making headway in the high-end and shore up its lead in the mid-range categories in the interim.</p><p>Another limiting factor in the past was that phones powered by MediaTek would take longer to get software updates, but that just isn't the case now. My Vivo X100 Pro made the switch to Android 15 at the same time as Qualcomm-based rivals, and MediaTek is working closely with major brands to ensure it provides the requisite drivers to roll out updates faster.</p><p>Ultimately, it's good to see there are two great choices of platforms for Android flagships, and I want MediaTek to continue its momentum with the Dimensity 9500.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Trump administration today laid out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">AI Action Plan</a>, a 23-page document outlining over 90 policy decisions regarding AI to be implemented over the next year. The document, subtitled "winning the race," removes regulations and policies the administration views as restricting AI innovation in the country.</p><p>Michael Kratsios, who leads the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5213904/trump-ai-regulations" target="_blank">NPR</a> that the Trump administration will consult with the AI industry and others to iron out the details. Kratsios compared the Biden-era regulations <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/eu-regulations-push-android-makers-update-policies-extend">to European Commission rules on technology</a>, saying "we cannot afford to go down Europe's innovation-killing regulatory path."</p><p>U.S. President Trump wrote in the plan that "it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance." That involves harnessing "the full power of American innovation," according to the President, which is why the AI Action Plan will deregulate AI research and development in major ways.</p><h2 id="how-the-trump-administration-plans-to-reshape-national-ai-development-2">How the Trump administration plans to reshape national AI development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="y3svnJjFtZUz59875noaPo" name="trump.jpg" alt="Donald-trump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y3svnJjFtZUz59875noaPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The plan involves three pillars: innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy and security.</p><p>The first pillar includes policy recommendations intended to support AI development, such as supporting AI adoption in the federal government and encouraging open-source model development. It also plans to amend the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework to "eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change."</p><p>The government plans to review LLMs to "ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias." It's not immediately clear how this will be evaluated, but the Trump administration will not grant government contracts to companies who don't meet this arbitrary threshold.</p><p>Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education will prioritize AI skill development in an attempt to "empower American workers in the age of AI."</p><p>The second pillar focuses on supporting AI infrastructure in the U.S., and will streamline permits for AI data centers and eliminate or reduce climate-related restrictions. Specifically, the Trump administration wants to streamline or reduce regulations enforced by the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, among other environmental standards set by federal law.</p><p>Part of the infrastructure pillar includes expanding and stabilizing the U.S. electrical grid, strengthening the country's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-doubling-down-on-cybersecurity-using-ai">cybersecurity defenses</a>, and creating AI incident response plans at the federal level.</p><p>Finally, the international diplomacy and security pillar will increase U.S. exports in AI and technology to its allies while fortifying export controls on "countries of concern." Financing from the Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank will be used to create AI export packages for "countries willing to join America’s AI alliance."</p><p>For countries that the Trump administration believes to be a concern, it will look to strictly enforce export controls for technology needed for semiconductor manufacturing. The administration will simultaneously increase export control requirements beyond just major systems required for fabrication, expanding them to include component sub-systems. From there, the federal government plans to monitor and enforce these regulations on foreign exports.</p><p>"This would include monitoring emerging technology developments in AI compute to ensure full coverage of possible countries or regions where chips are being diverted," the plan explains. "This enhanced monitoring could then be used to expand and increase end-use monitoring in countries where there is a high risk of diversion of advanced, U.S.-origin AI compute."</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-ai-development-in-the-u-s-2">What this means for AI development in the U.S.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="xTaymBWk4xfFCEbEqErME8" name="Donald-Trump-Elon-Musk" alt="A photo of xAI CEO Elon Musk with U.S. President Donald Trump." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTaymBWk4xfFCEbEqErME8.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The White House)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the current Biden-era regulations, development of AI must comply with standards intended to reduce the risk of misinformation and limit the climate impacts of building out AI infrastructure. The proposed AI Action Plan from the Trump administration aims to reverse many of these policies. It believes that cutting red tape will encourage AI innovation in the U.S., according to Kratsios.</p><p>Currently, this plan is made up of policy goals that the federal government wants to implement with "near-term execution." However, they will not be enacted immediately. The first wave of changes may come via executive orders issued by President Trump imminently, but others could take longer.</p><p>It's also possible that parts of the AI Action Plan could face legal challenges, specifically those targeting DEI and ideological bias. The provisions could be challenged as content-based discrimination, according to UC San Francisco School of Law professor Rory Little speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-releases-ai-action-plan-that-offers-a-split-with-biden-155057658.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCLUmxb_-8g0_qZd--XqLuHivEyT6-TrcIkk2yn4K56TEC-lrKR3ruLZqz31fiUuPKRoM5GOEnrVgCypkXGNx9tsnAKzwJGqrJcX5rR42-wdLX5Dvy0-EhMDnJ6-b94Bijm8rSXXG3_XQR5F854BfYUrUux12c0CBP3XXQJqzuo" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>. With that being said, experts including Little believe AI companies bidding for government contracts may comply with the Trump administration's demands even if they are unlawful.</p><p>For now, we will have to wait and see how the Trump administration's policy goals are implemented, and how it shakes up AI development in the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But if you don&apos;t need the latest in wearable technology, you may be wondering: what does this mean for the Pixel Watch 3? Will the top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> finally get a permanent price drop? </p><p>While one can only speculate at this point, I&apos;m using my years of experience covering launches like this to tell you exactly what you can expect when the new wearable is unveiled. After all, Google Pixel Watch 3 deals are hardly unheard-of, but things might get more interesting once the popular wearable is officially deemed "last-gen". Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Google recently confirmed that the 2025 Made by Google event will be held in New York City on August 20th. The company is already advertising the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> on its store&apos;s website, and while we&apos;ve received no <em>official </em>word on the Pixel Watch 4 just yet, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">leaks and rumors</a> suggest that the wearable will be revealed alongside the new phones during the event. </p><p>As for the specs, we don&apos;t know a lot about the new smartwatch just yet. Some credible leaks have indicated that the wearable will boast the same teardrop-inspired design as its predecessor accompanied by an increase in thickness, which could suggest a bigger battery. The Pixel Watch 4 might also have smaller bezels than the previous generation, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">another rumor</a> has suggested that the watch will boast the same Snapdragon chipset as the Pixel Watch 3. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Vista-watch-face" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 on a white counter, showing the Vista watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is also certain to be equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, which means you&apos;ll get access to all of the fancy new UI features based on Material 3 Expressive, such as scrolling animations, new color themes, and redesigned tiles that work seamlessly with the Pixel Watch&apos;s uniquely curved display. And as expected, the new OS will seamlessly incorporate all of the latest AI-boosted software features from Gemini.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 10 lineup of flagship phones, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same price tag as its predecessor, starting at $349 for the 41mm version and setting you back $399 for the 45mm watch. You can also expect a ton of preorder deals to go live once the smartwatch is revealed on August 20th.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-watch-3-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-workout-screen" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million dollar question: will the Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper when the Pixel Watch 4 is unveiled? It&apos;s hard to say with certainty, but I can make a guess based on past device launches. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>, for example, was unveiled in 2023 with a starting price of $349, but now it&apos;s widely available for as low as $249. Slap on a discount during any major sale event and you can even find the last-gen watch for as little as $145. The problem is that its last-gen status also means that the wearable can be hard to find through some retailers. Indeed, the longer you wait to buy a last-gen device, the more likely it is that the item will be out of stock when you go to make your purchase. </p><p>In other words, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily wait for an official price drop to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. Instead, simply shop for the watch during the next major sale event, such as Black Friday or one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/back-to-school">back-to-school sales</a> that are beginning to kick off across the web. After all, the Pixel Watch 3 dropped to $249.99 during Amazon Prime Day a few weeks ago, and the watch isn&apos;t even last-gen yet. I expect that record-smashing discount to return this fall, so if you don&apos;t mind waiting a bit longer, that might be the best time to buy. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="727b7f0f-2e80-4181-8f44-aa29ad304df2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apDLG7FTha4HiWLEWcBvEH.png' alt="Render of the black Google Pixel Watch 3 45mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Google Pixel Watch (for now)</strong></em></p><p>With its incredibly sleek design and a bounty of Wear OS smarts, the Google Pixel Watch 3 easily ranks among the best Android smartwatches ever built.

Probably not, but slap on a discount and it may become one of the best value devices of 2025. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses channel the HSTN style with a unique flair, plus goodies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/preorder-now-to-get-metas-limited-edition-oakley-smart-glasses-before-everyone-else">Prizm 24K Polarized lenses</a>.</p><p>And while the upgrade to a 3K camera sounds nice on paper, the real upgrade everyone wants is better battery life. After all, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">capture high-quality video</a>, but with 30 minutes max of recording time. It's hard to tote them around all day and snap footage without having to put them back in the charging case.</p><p>The company says Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses sport double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses — specifically, 8 hours of regular usage, while Ray-Ban is only rated at 4 hours — but does that actually pan out in real life? I put both glasses to the test to see which lasted longest and if Meta's claims were true. Get ready to get excited!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-camera-lab-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Camera lab test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-boxes-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with their respective boxes and charging cases on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lab test is the theoretical battery life maximum you'll get out of these smart glasses. For this test, I put Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on a table, set the recording time for 3 minutes, and pressed the recording button. Once the glasses stopped recording, I'd press the button again to capture another video.</p><p>I repeated this process until both glasses' batteries were depleted. From there, I'd dock the glasses in the case, let it sync with the Meta AI app, then count the amount of video time recorded via each clip in the app.</p><div ><table><caption>Lab camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Video resolution</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded until battery drained</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>3K</p></td><td  ><p>35</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's clear that Meta put in some good work to optimize the battery life for Oakley Meta HSTN. The only battery life metric supplied by the company is "8 hours of average usage" on a single charge, but it doesn't specify whether it'll double the Ray-Bans' battery life for <em>specific</em>, high-power tasks.</p><p>While 50 minutes isn't quite double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses' 30-minute time, it's much closer to double than I expected. Given there's not much difference in quality when using the 3K mode, as shown by my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">Oakley Meta HSTN camera review</a>, I recommend most users keep the default 1080p setting and enjoy longer recording time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-real-world-camera-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Real-world camera test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-both" alt="Wearing transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on my head at the same time" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Meta only rates these glasses for the average usage time per charge, I spent a few days out and about with each pair of glasses to find out how accurate Meta's claims were. In this first test, my wife wore Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and I wore Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. Each was paired to a phone that we had with us, so they both had the same level of syncing and connectivity to the Meta AI app.</p><p>Every time one of us took a picture or recorded a video, the other person would do the same thing. I felt this was the most accurate way to "real world" test these glasses, as two people were wearing them full time, doing the same things.</p><div ><table><caption>Real-world camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th><th  ><p>Number of photos taken</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>75%</p></td><td  ><p>14</p></td><td  ><p>6:21 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ><p>15</p></td><td  ><p>6:09 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:09 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>36%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:00 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>0%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>26:50 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>38%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>27:55 @ 1080p</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lab tests showed a far more impressive difference between the two glasses, but more real-world usage reduces the gap quite a bit. Oakley Meta HSTN's battery life is a notable improvement over Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses when using the camera a lot, but mostly only when using the default 1080p video setting.</p><p>I'm not sure what you need to do to get to Meta's estimated 8-hour battery life, but I was never able to hit that unless I was barely using the glasses at all. Any time I specifically tried using the glasses, I found that 3-4 hours was a more reasonable expectation of battery life.</p><p>At best, Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses lasted about an hour longer than the Ray-Bans. I expected this to be better in real-world usage, especially considering the lab camera test results above. Still, it's a decent upgrade over the Ray-Bans, especially if you can get an entire hour of additional usage out of a single charge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-live-streaming-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Live streaming test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6" name="oakley-meta-hstn-with-box-02" alt="Warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its box and charging case on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Did you know you could livestream to Facebook or Instagram straight from your Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses? All you need to do is open either app, start a new live video, then follow the on-screen prompts to switch over to your glasses. You can switch between your phone's camera and the glasses camera at any time by double-pressing the capture button on your glasses.</p><p>As you might expect, livestreaming takes quite a toll on your glasses' battery life, but do the camera efficiency improvements on Oakley Meta HSTN transfer over to livestreaming? I started a live stream with each pair of glasses at 90% battery and let it run until the glasses died, checking the battery life every 10 minutes. Here are the results.</p><div ><table><caption>Instagram live streaming test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes streamed</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>39 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>12%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>48 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Based on the test, it looks like Oakley Meta HSTN can livestream for around 10-15 minutes longer than Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. Not quite the gulf in battery life between the two glasses as we saw while recording 1080p video, but it's still a nice improvement!</p><p>If you're a person who livestreams from their glasses a lot, Oakley Meta HSTN are the better choice.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-audio-playback"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Audio playback</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B" name="oakley-meta-hstn-youtube-music" alt="Streaming YouTube Music on a pair of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While you're bound to take pictures and record videos with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, the likelihood is that you'll be using it to listen to music, make phone calls, or talk to Meta AI more often.</p><p>Neither pair of glasses is designed for a single specific task for hours at a time, but I wanted to get an idea of how long you could reasonably stream music to them before they'd need a top-up. For this test, I set both glasses to 60% volume and streamed music from a YouTube Music playlist until one pair gave me the low battery warning.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at start</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>85%</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>83%</p></td><td  ><p>22%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/303057485648146/?srsltid=AfmBOooq9MsFYQ3JeDLNeQ-wpcwqz35WwiP4hnEwndCZpL4Zr6xA8l5M">Meta estimates</a> that Oakley Meta HSTN will give you 5 hours of continuous audio playback, while Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses will deliver 4 hours. Based on the numbers in my tests, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses drain at a rate of roughly 30% per hour of music streaming. Oakley Meta HSTN improves that to about 25% battery used per hour of music streaming.</p><p>That's a solid improvement, even if it means these won't be replacing your earbuds for all-day listening. At best, I can see getting 4 hours of audio playback from the Oakleys, while Ray-Bans top out at about 3 hours. Both glasses come about 1 hour short of Meta's estimates in my testing.</p><p>Querying Meta AI barely makes a dent in the battery, in my testing, and I would estimate that you would need to make hundreds of queries to drain either glasses' battery to any significant degree. Yes, this even includes using the "what do you see" type functionality where the glasses take a photo and Meta AI analyzes it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-charging-time-and-conclusion"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Charging time and conclusion</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-charging-app-01" alt="Looking at the battery life for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever your glasses' battery gets low, you'll need to dock them in the included charging case for a while to be able to use them again. While there are several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meta+ray-ban+charger&crid=3324I3MFNSBXK&sprefix=razr%2B+2024%2Caps%2C127&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">charging cable alternatives on Amazon</a>, the likelihood is that you'll charge the glasses with the included case since that can be taken anywhere.</p><p>This case works just like a charging case that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> ship with, so you'll need to occasionally charge the case itself so that it can keep your glasses juiced up. On average, the charging case can fully charge your glasses around 6 times before needing to be recharged itself. Here's how long it takes for the case to charge the glasses.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-50%</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-100%</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>18 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>40 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses charge slightly quicker than Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, but this is mainly down to battery size differences. Oakley Meta HSTN has a larger battery so, at the same charging rate, you're going to see a difference in time. That 20-minute charge will get you 2 hours of music streaming, 22 minutes of 1080p video recording time, or dozens upon dozens of photos from the Oakleys.</p><p>Music streaming time has been improved, even if these still won't last long enough to replace a full day's worth of headphone or earbud usage. Considering the gap in quality between a proper set of earbuds and these glasses, though, you're not going to want to try to jam to your favorite tunes in the highest quality on them, anyway.</p><p>Overall, Meta has improved battery life on Oakley Meta HSTN versus Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, with the biggest improvements happening while using the camera on the glasses. From longer livestreaming time to nearly double the video capture time at the same resolution, this is a great upgrade for anyone who loves using their glasses as a way to capture their world.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="53a51519-eb07-4652-a84b-cede07eebe4c">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, better battery life, higher-resolution video capture, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that Nothing's potential new series branding addition could take on a "Lite" or "T" moniker. It doesn't seem like there's anything more concrete than this speculation, like a future device name.</p><p>However, judging by the monikers, both "Lite" and "T" suggest budget, but there's already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">the 3a series for that</a>. So, this rumor is quite curious, to say the least.</p><p>The tipster wasn't done, as they allege Nothing isn't quite satisfied with its Pro models. According to Brar, the "Pro models are just not cutting it."</p><h2 id="new-direction-2">New Direction?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously stated, the rumor is curious; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Nothing's 3a series</a>—or the "a" series in general—is already walking that affordable phone line. The devices are typically under Nothing's flagship-oriented devices (think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Phone 3</a>) in terms of specs. Where the Phone 3a Pro features the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, the "true flagship" Phone 3 picked up the newer Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. More than that, is the device's price point.</p><p>Thinking flagship, the Phone 3 debuted at $799 in the U.S. On the other hand, the 3a and 3a Pro launched for $379 and $459, respectively.</p><p>It's hard to imagine Nothing going any lower than its base 3a pricing, then you begin to wonder how specifications and how much lower things could go without losing consumers. Things could end up quite differently, though. Perhaps, what we're looking at is a change in Nothing's branding from the "a" series to "Lite" or possibly "T" (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">like OnePlus</a>).</p><p>Putting things into perspective, the OnePlus 13T sort of splits the gap in the company's recent launches, as the device sports a smaller 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, but it sports the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>For now, without concrete evidence, it's worth taking these rumors with a grain of salt.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Those who bought the 1.3-inch Watch 6 Classic won't mind, but this model will be about 10g heavier and may look too bulky on small wrists.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4byeivMPD99DP3ZCNdDZTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4byeivMPD99DP3ZCNdDZTG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-side-view" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on the left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-quick-button" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on top of an ornamental gold bowl, the right side with three buttons showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung also transplanted the third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a> from the Galaxy Watch Ultra.

The left side is quite stark, flat, and chunky, but <em>you</em> won't see it, only others.</p><p>The normal Watch 8 display looks naked by comparison, but that also makes it that much lighter and skinnier. Unless you're accustomed to heavier smartwatches, the Classic's thick steel case might feel burdensome — especially for sleep tracking.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-battery-and-charging"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Battery and charging</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfgCE7gAWiXdDJEJjZgc4L" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-charging" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic atop its charger on carpet, the display showing 4% battery and 1 hr 26 minutes until full." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfgCE7gAWiXdDJEJjZgc4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Samsung promises 30 hours per charge with always-on display (AOD) or 40 hours normally.</strong></li><li><strong>The Watch 8 Classic takes about 90 minutes to hit 100% power.</strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorials</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/should-you-upgrade-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-watch-8-classic"><strong>Is the Galaxy Watch 8 worth the upgrade?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-doesnt-support-quick-release-bands-anymore"><strong>It's the end of an era for the Watch 8 Classic</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-size-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-8-classic-should-you-buy"><strong>Which size of Galaxy Watch 8 should you buy?</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Most Galaxy Watches last between 1–2 days, with the capacity slowly fading over time.

Even with AOD and the "Hey Google" wake word active, my Watch 8 Classic lasted across two nights of sleep tracking. Dozens of Gemini commands (plus AOD) burned about 20% battery across a full afternoon, but even that put it on pace for 25 hours; with more casual usage, it lasts twice as long.</p><p>For workouts, two hours of dual-band GPS tracking and a fully bright display burned about 20% battery, so 10 hours seems like a reasonable estimate with a full charge.</p><p>You may see faster battery burn if you spend more time outdoors or use music storage.

Google and third-party apps still require a full Tile to themselves. But I'm hoping Samsung will make this format available to other devs.</p><p>The other new tool is the Now Bar, which you trigger with a double-finger tap gesture. It pulls up contextually relevant info like your current playlist or timer onto the main watch face, or else takes you to your most recent notification if nothing is pertinent.

Considering Samsung has been selling the Watch 7 for under $200 recently, spending $500 would be a bitter bill even without the controversial changes.</p><p>If you're a die-hard Samsung fan looking to get healthier, the Galaxy Watch 8 will fit the bill for less...but anyone hesitating over the Classic will <em>definitely</em> hate the base model. And even if Samsung switches back to the status quo with the Galaxy Watch 9, we probably won't see a new Classic until 2027.</p><p>So it's really a simple decision. If you like the bezel and can trade in your old Classic to Samsung to cut the bill in half, I'd suggest buying the Watch 8 Classic; you may find that the new design grows on you. For others, this heavy, expensive smartwatch may be the wrong fit.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7a2885c9-e0e2-475c-a8a3-d5ceddd89e62">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster can allegedly "confirm" the Galaxy S26 Edge will feature a "larger battery" whenever Samsung debuts it next year. Rumors add that this bigger battery will occur, thanks to some new "battery material technology" that Samsung is allegedly thinking of implementing.</p><p>It also seems that Samsung isn't pulling back on its interest in creating thin (and even thinner) phones.</p><p>The post on X claims Samsung is investing resources into creating a Galaxy S26 Edge that's even thinner the S25 Edge. The tipster's weren't accompanied by any estimations for its battery capacity or slimmer measurement, so we'll have to take this with a grain of salt for now.</p><p>Samsung debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a>, the S25 series' fourth member, in May. We're likely still a great distance away from a second-generation launch, but there are some recent developments to consider.</p><h2 id="gaining-the-edge-2">Gaining the Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">with the "beyond slim" tagline</a>, as the company truly pushed the sleek and slim idea behind slab phones. The device sports a 6.7-inch display and a dual camera array (200MP primary lens), but it's main eye-catching aspect was its 5.8mm profile. The S25 Edge is slimmer than the rest of the S25 series; however, it came at the price of its battery.</p><p>There was bound to be a trade-off, and it seems the device's 3,900mAh battery was the result of thinner aspirations. Moreover, Samsung outfit the phone with a 25W wired charging adapter, which could reach 55% charge in thirty minutes.</p><p>A "larger battery" would undoubtedly help the device go for longer periods of time. How Samsung could go about this is key. Some users on X theorize Samsung might go down the silicon-carbon route with the S26 Edge. We've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">similar rumors reported earlier this year</a> from South Korea, so that's one side of the speculation.</p><p>A more recent report claims that Samsung has switched gears and is now actively chasing down a new battery material known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>." Supposedly, this material can "significantly" increase a device's battery capacity, though it's unclear as to how much that could be. It's also been stated that SUS CAN could benefit future Galaxy phones by bringing greater energy density and quickening charging speeds.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The former is something small and light, while the latter can have your family member tossing confetti into the air or something else.</p><p>Google says these clips are six seconds long and that users can share them after creating.</p><h2 id="clips-remixes-2">Clips & Remixes</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:632px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.94%;"><img id="bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-splash" alt="Google Photos begins receiving a photo-to-video feature that lets users turn their static images into short six second clips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="632" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.30%;"><img id="drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-options" alt="Photo-to-video in Google Photos lets users choose between two options to create a quick, six second animated clip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="554" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:630px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.24%;"><img id="MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D" name="google-photos-remix-styles-selection" alt="Google Photos' Remix lets users decide which unique style they'd like AI to turn their photos into, like comic or sketch styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="630" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.36%;"><img id="nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D" name="google-photos-remix-wedding-example" alt="Google Photos introduces "Remix," a way to reimagine your photos in unique styles like animation, comic, sketch, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="534" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Similarly, users can also "save" their AI-generated clip, if they'd like, or they can "regenerate" to try something new until it's right.</p><p>Google's photo-to-video feature in its Photos app is rolling out today on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>In a similar AI-created vein, Google highlights another feature headed for devices today called "Remix." Remixing your photos lets users reimagine them in a whole new light. Think about turning your Christmas photos into an anime snapshot or a simple birthday party photo into a sketch. Google adds that users will find other options, such as "Comic" and "3D animation."</p><p>Lastly, the app can generate remixes of people and pets. Google says Remix will begin rolling out in Photos "in the next few weeks" on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>Additionally, Google reiterates that photos reimagined through Remix will be marked with a SynthID digital watermark, so others know that the content they're viewing was AI-generated. Despite rolling out officially to all users, Google warns that these features (Remix and photo-to-video) are experimental. It states the AI generation could get things wrong and encourages users to provide feedback via the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons upon generation.</p><h2 id="a-hub-for-creation-2">A Hub for Creation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.77%;"><img id="9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H" name="google-photos-create-tab-example" alt="Google is preparing a new hub for AI generative functions in its Photos app called "Create."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest features rolling out for Google Photos will fly solo for a little while; however, the company plans to introduce a new "Create" tab in August.</p><p>This tab will be featured along the bottom of the app's UI, alongside other options like "Photos," "Collection," and "Search."

With previous iterations, the cover screen was relegated to more basic games, as it was just too narrow to really enjoy much of anything else. But, unfolded? Well, then you have a tablet for a more immersive and pleasant experience.</p><p>In my time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, this has largely continued to be the case. Playing games like Threes (yes, I still play it), Balatro, and Letterlike is quick and easy to fire up and play one-handed. I even dabbled a bit with trying to use it as an awkwardly tall Game Boy for some Pokémon Pinball, but that wasn't really my cup of tea.</p><h2 id="big-and-beautiful-2">Big and beautiful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-11" alt="Backbone Pro connected to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leaning on GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, the star of the show is the inner display, which Samsung has made better than ever. There are practically no awkward crease distortions to speak of, which is nice for a change. Plus, the 8-inch OLED panel simply looks incredible, especially when playing modern games or retro games that are upscaled.</p><p>Before getting into the gameplay itself, let's talk about controls. I absolutely despise trying to play platforming games with just a touchscreen, so I have quite a collection of different phone controllers. I recently picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/">Backbone Pro</a> controller, so I connected the Fold 7 and was off to the races.</p><p>However, I quickly noticed that, unlike the Fold 6 and traditional phones, the Fold 7 is so thin that there was a gap between the phone and the back of the controller. Backbone includes a few adapters in the box to help mitigate this, but really, Bluetooth controllers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> will give the phone a bit more support on the back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-10" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4636" height="2608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to actually playing those games, the Fold 7 is a beast, and there's really no way around it. It chews through even the most demanding games found on the Play Store, but that's to be expected. Where the real strength comes through is with emulation, and for the most part, the Fold 7 doesn't disappoint here either.</p><h2 id="windows-and-playstation-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Windows and PlayStation on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4202px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-6" alt="Fallout 4 on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 via GameSir GameHub (Winlator)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4202" height="2364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't sit back and play through games for hours on end, but I did try out Fallout 4 and Hades 2 via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">GameHub (Winlator)</a>, Tears of the Kingdom via Citron, and Burnout Paradise via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">RPCSX</a>. For whatever reason, I couldn't get either Fallout or Hades to launch using the standard build of Winlator.</p><p>But after importing them via the GameHub app, both games fired right up, which I was thankful to see. The only real problem I experienced was frame drops in certain scenes at the beginning of Fallout 4. Even then, it never dropped below 23-25fps, reaching a peak of around 58fps. There's a decent chance this could be a caching issue, so I'll be taking another look to see if that's the case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4834px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-1" alt="Burnout Paradise via RPCSX on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4834" height="2719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a> with RPCSX, once I got everything set up properly, I was able to get Burnout Paradise loaded, and things were looking pretty good with around a 30fps during the opening cut scene. And then it rapidly dropped to around 10 fps before bottoming out at 0fps.</p><p>What's weird about this is that the background music was still playing, and there weren't even any audio crackles or anything to make it seem like the game was frozen. Perhaps there's some tinkering to be done, but I can only assume that it's more to do with the emulator itself, as other games I tried wouldn't even load.</p><h2 id="switching-it-up-2">Switching it up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4715px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-8" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4715" height="2652" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, it's always fun to see how well Switch games will run on new hardware. Currently, I have at least five different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">Switch emulators</a> installed, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Citron seems to be one of the most popular of the bunch. So, what better way to test Switch emulation than with Tears of the Kingdom?</p><p>This was a patented case of "they had me in the first half," because the gameplay was pretty smooth, hovering around 30fps. Things slowed down a bit after the encounter with Ganondorf, dropping to between 20-25fps, but still totally playable.</p><p>Unfortunately, once I grabbed Link's tunic from the first chest of the game and started to head out of the cave, it just stopped. Unlike Burnout on RPCSX, the screen froze for a moment or two before the game crashed entirely, taking me back to the main Citron screen.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-monster-2">It's a monster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4208px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6nkxFeq6cqsdNJ8FeHuXdY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-4" alt="Balatro Menu Screen on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6nkxFeq6cqsdNJ8FeHuXdY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4208" height="2367" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth pointing out that while all three of the aforementioned emulators include custom GPU support, I stuck with the stock configuration. This is mostly because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/why-does-retro-gaming-and-emulation-matter-so-much">Turnip drivers</a> still aren't tuned for the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and it provided more of an "out-of-the-box" test bed.</p><p>That being said, I look forward to testing out more games on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, seeing what is and isn't possible. This is really a "do-it-all" phone, as it can help pass the time while you're waiting in line at the store, get work done from wherever, and double as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> when it's time to unwind.

This UI update specifically involves the notification that appears after connecting your earbuds, which displays each bud's and the case's battery percentage. Google is seemingly working on massively reworking this by placing your case and earbud icons inside colorful circles.</p><p>At full charge, the Fast Pair UI will encircle your devices in a light green container. The top of the circle features the UI's old battery icon that was previously placed beneath each icon beside the percentage. The tipster shows that as your device's power is consumed, Google plans for the circle to recede, but it will also slowly change colors.</p><p>As your power drops, the circle changes from green to yellow (half battery/under) and finally to red (low battery).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="qQeVMDiAvCwhuYjn8T9JB4" name="google-android-os-fast-pair-battery-ui-leaked" alt="A leaked snapshot from a tipster, regarding Google's potential Fast Pair UI rework for battery notifications.

Additionally, Fast Pair's notification will indicate which earbud is which (left and right), as well as a "C" for case.</p><p>The tipster adds that they discovered these Fast Pair UI changes in version 25.28.31 of Google Play Services. As usual, discoveries like this often come without an arrival date in mind. The company could simply keep this on the shelf, but there's a chance we might see it, considering Google's recent Android OS design changes. All we're left with now is the waiting game.</p><h2 id="all-about-being-more-expressive-2">All about being more 'Expressive'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kdzzQkjeSpjkYjKJxhHxiF" name="Material-3-Expressive-Leak" alt="The leaked Material 3 Expressive design." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdzzQkjeSpjkYjKJxhHxiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's supposed Fast Pair battery UI rework gives strong Apple AirPod vibes. The company may have taken inspiration from its competitor for Android, but there's another thing to keep in mind: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>. During its Android 16 launch, the company highlighted its most significant Android OS redesign, nicknamed M3 Expressive. At its core, Google says it wants to craft a UI that "feels good" and "makes sense."</p><p>Google intended to help Android's UI guide users to keep them focused and engaged with what they're doing. To achieve that, M3 Expressive focuses on colors, shapes, sizes, motion, and containment.</p><p>Many of these attributes can be placed right beside this new Fast Pair battery UI change we've seen leaked. Considering Google hasn't given that particular aspect of its OS a face-lift, maybe it's finally time.</p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As Samsung parades its latest wearables around, showing off their fitness and health tracking prowess, band compatibility hasn't been discussed much.</p><p>One of the things that I loved about Samsung Galaxy Watch models was the use of standard quick-release connectors for their bands. Until the Galaxy Watch 7, you could use bands compatible with all generations, dating back to the Watch 4, Watch 3, or even the OG Galaxy Watch, allowing for seamless interchangeability across all generations leading up to the Watch 7. This was a huge advantage as it opened the door to countless options.</p><p>Disappointingly, the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic no longer use quick-release connectors. I'm really upset about it.</p><h2 id="what-purpose-does-this-move-serve-2">What purpose does this move serve?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-22" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't the only smartwatch maker that favors proprietary connectors. Google does the same with its Pixel Watch family. But the difference is, Google has always done it that way. Additionally, all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch</a> models can use interchangeable bands, as they all utilize the same connector. It presents a unified front and solidifies the Pixel Watch brand.</p><p>But I don't understand why Samsung would move away from quick-release bands after seven generations of smartwatches. Being able to use standard bands designed for another Galaxy Watch on any other model made it more cost-effective to buy a Samsung wearable. You could hold on to your old bands and reuse them, or buy previously released straps that tend to be cheaper than newly released ones. Upcycling older bands for new smartwatches is also a more sustainable approach.</p><p>According to Samsung, the change was made so the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic could sit flatter on the wrist. However, I am not sure if this small design change was worth trading in quick-release connectors. Do the benefits of a flatter fit outweigh the advantages of universal strap compatibility?</p><p>It's a change that no one really asked for, and yet, Samsung felt the need to lose what was arguably one of the best features of its wearables.</p><h2 id="is-the-new-dynamic-lug-system-better-than-quick-release-connectors-2">Is the new Dynamic Lug System better than quick-release connectors?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-dynamic-lug-system" alt="How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="634" height="356" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Dynamic Lug System, you click one button and the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">Galaxy Watch 8 band</a> pops off. Plugging a strap back in is very straightforward. You simply align the connectors and push the band in. It clicks into place swiftly. It's very much like the connectors on the Samsung Galaxy One-Click Watch bands that we've seen before.</p><p>Admittedly, the new Dynamic Lug System is quicker than quick-release pins, but there was nothing explicitly wrong with the quick-release connectors to begin with. I suppose speed matters to a lot of people, but it's only a few seconds' difference either way. Besides the flatter fit, I don't think the time difference in swapping out bands justifies such a major shift either.</p><p>I value backwards compatibility and the use of an industry standard a lot more than quicker band swap time or a thinner wearable.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-samsung-users-who-will-be-effected-by-this-2">It's not just Samsung users who will be effected by this</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is a big slice of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable pie</a>. Many quick-release 20mm and 22mm bands are marketed or designed specifically for Samsung Galaxy Watch models, but because they use standardized pins, they can also be used by many other smartwatches. This is why this shift also affects other brands as well.</p><p>OnePlus, Amazfit, Garmin, Withings, and Xiaomi smartwatches all use the standard 22mm or 20mm quick-release bands that the last seven generations of Galaxy Watches used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could easily use a nice Amazfit band on your Galaxy Watch or vice versa. Everyone was happy. Either way, both sides profited from this arrangement.</p><p>Now that Samsung has moved on to a new system, consumers won't be able to enjoy as wide a pool when buying smartwatch bands. As usual, it's the consumers like me and you who lose in the end.</p><p>And what can be done about this? The brutal truth is there's not much to do besides complaining and hoping for a better future. Maybe Samsung will revert to quick-release pins with the Galaxy Watch 9, but I'm not counting on it. For now, we just have to accept it as is or buy older Galaxy wearables if this is a deal breaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="44fdffef-7e89-458f-9388-19a79a37dc0c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Switching things up</strong></em></p><p>Like it or not, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic ditches the standard quick-release bands for Samsung's proprietary Dynamic Lug ones.

Joining is Samsung's executive vice president and Head of Mobile Display Product Planning Team, Hojung Lee, who states, "This new panel not only builds consumer confidence in foldable OLED durability..."</p><p>Samsung says it has conducted tests with the Fold 7's display and can report that the device can withstand 500,000 folds, up significantly from 200,000 folds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">previous Z Fold models</a>. Let's not forget about the original Galaxy Fold that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-fold-dies-after-120000-folds-cnet-torture-test">only survived 120,000 folds</a>.</p><p>The post states Samsung Display leveraged a "shock-resistant" structure for its new OLED panel, which took inspiration from bulletproof glass. The company says the elastic outer layer (the one that takes the bullet's impact energy) is the idea behind the Fold 7's Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) outer layer. Samsung says it increased this layer's thickness by roughly 50%, while also adding a new "high-elastic adhesive" to each layer of the OLED.</p><p>In short, this was designed to increase the display's "recovery" fold after fold. It seems this has worked, as Samsung taps Bureau Veritas, which conducted the inspection. According to its tests, the Fold 7's display has remained operable after 500,000 folds, which Samsung says equates to around 10 years of use for the average user.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-fold-7-has-turned-heads-2">The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has turned heads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year-expectancy drops a little for "heavy use" users, as Samsung states the Fold 7 can last roughly six years with ~200 estimated folds per day.</p><p>Samsung's been on a tear, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7">detailing the various advancements</a> taken to improve its slimmest-ever Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Last week, the company discussed what it took to make the device so sleek. Such upgrades include the phone's new 3rd generation Armor FlexHinge, which cuts down its profile by 27% and enables a flatter, more open inner display when fully opened.</p><p>The Fold 7 has achieved an 8.9mm measurement when folded, a drastic drop from its previous iterations. This was helped in part by Samsung's removal of the S Pen.</p><p>On the other hand, all of these changes have seemed to benefit Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">as a report from South Korea</a> shows the Fold 7 leading the sales charge over the Flip 7. This is the first time a Galaxy Z Fold device has led Samsung's sales for its foldable department. While the Flip is typically the one consumers reach for, the Fold 7 is carrying roughly 60% of the pre-orders this year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5649196389409786183&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&track=ac-us-2464517706506802132&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1617837727828318802&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=Samsung%20details%20how%20it%20made%20its%20slimmest%20Galaxy%20Z%20Fold%207%20and%20Z%20Flip%207&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-5445094904884312851-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-6047595860180987069&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1140351136575126786&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7170f3fe-1d43-4c6a-adb1-0fad10f15122">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vdh6Duir2Ft8yo3JpKatrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

However, some users of the ultra flagship phone are having a bitter experience with the camera after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review" target="_blank">One UI 7</a> update.</p><p>Several Galaxy S23 series users have shared their disappointment in using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> camera as the photos taken after the update are seemingly blurry, washed out, and feel less sharp (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/galaxy-s23-camera-quality-one-ui-7/">Tech-Issues Today</a>).</p><p>Some users who have installed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15" target="_blank">Android 15</a>-based One UI 7 update have taken to forums, including Reddit and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Camera-quality-degraded/td-p/20094032" target="_blank">Samsung community pages</a>, to share their frustration as their Galaxy S23 series cameras aren't clicking pictures as well as they previously did.

While some complain about the blurry images, washed-out colors (even in bright sunlight), others seem to be facing issues with the camera app too. They include slight delays when switching between modes or going back and forth between the selfie shooter or the primary cameras. And for some, the preview appears to be not loading up immediately.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1lxyvi3/camera_delay_with_oneui7">Camera Delay with OneUI7?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra">r/GalaxyS23Ultra</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>A Galaxy S23 FE user has also noted that the device's camera captures better in low light when running the One UI 6.1 update, as opposed to the latest One UI 7 update.</p><p>The publication further notes some users have come up with their own fixes like clearing the camera cache, resetting camera preferences, tweaking features like scene optimizer, experimenting with pro mode, and several similar tweaks.

Most of the overall design and concept are the same, with all buttons in the same places, speakers in the same places, and even nose pads and charging bridges looking identical. The real difference is in the trademark styles between the two companies, including lenses, as well as the cameras used on the front of each.</p><p>Both glasses capture in 3:4 portrait mode, and there's no option to rotate the video. Likewise, both glasses only support 30FPS recording at this time, although the wording in the Meta AI app seems to suggest that more options might be available in the future.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Interface</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge. 50 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 4 hours per charge: 30 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 48 hours</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Prescription lens support</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>53g</p></td><td  ><p>49g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unlocking-3k-resolution"><span>Unlocking 3K resolution</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-meta-ai-app-resolution-options" alt="Changing the video recording resolution on Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By default, Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses only record at the same 1080p resolution as Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.

Other rooms, like the first two examples, are filled with large, overhanging plants that make it quite a bit darker, even during broad daylight.</p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN glasses produce a crisper image than Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses at all times, but that difference can sometimes be more subtle than you had hoped for.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KE72sbodirGEbGKM7WUaRM" name="oakley-meta-vs-ray-ban-meta-camera-02" alt="Comparing the video quality between Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KE72sbodirGEbGKM7WUaRM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HN6YSSgJDNQWFaAZvdtzUM" name="oakley-meta-vs-ray-ban-meta-camera-01" alt="Comparing the video quality between Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HN6YSSgJDNQWFaAZvdtzUM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FpE9v7uWVVRnPz7cJJYrMM" name="oakley-meta-vs-ray-ban-meta-camera-03" alt="Comparing the video quality between Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpE9v7uWVVRnPz7cJJYrMM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In many settings, like this bright Orangerie, I couldn't tell the difference between the two smart glasses videos when watching them side by side, even though the Oakleys sport a 50% resolution increase.</p><p>Zooming in revealed some differences, but they were subtler than I was expecting.

the glasses mostly look good, but they struggle to balance things out when there's too much light in a scene.

Filed in a New York federal court this week, Google’s lawsuit claims BadBox 2.0 infected uncertified devices—like budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming boxes</a>, tablets, and projectors—by either slipping in malware before they shipped or sneaking it in through shady apps on open-source Android systems.</p><p>The infected devices were then used to carry out widespread ad fraud and other cybercrimes. On the bright side, Google’s Ad Traffic Quality team has upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Play Protect</a> to automatically shut down any apps tied to BadBox 2.0.</p><p>Google’s lawsuit points to specific infected devices, including Android TV boxes like the X88 Pro 10, T95, MXQ Pro, and QPLOVE Q9. Human Security has shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/" target="_blank">longer list</a> for those curious.</p><h2 id="is-your-device-on-the-list-2">Is your device on the list?</h2><p>If you’re using one of those flagged devices, it’s a good idea to disconnect it immediately. According to Google, the BadBox malware hides in the background and silently fakes ad clicks without tipping you off.</p><p>The FBI has put out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605" target="_blank">public warning</a> about the scope of this threat, saying hackers are using compromised TV streamers, projectors, car infotainment systems, and even digital photo frames to break into home networks. Most of these infected devices, the agency notes, were made in China.</p><p>Hackers are slipping into home networks in two main ways: by loading malware onto devices before they’re even sold, or by sneaking it in during setup through shady apps with hidden backdoors. When these infected IoT devices go online, they can be roped into the BadBox 2.0 botnet or used as residential proxies, both of which are often tied to sketchy online activity.</p><p>Ad fraud seems to be a major issue for Google here. The company says it's stuck footing the bill for fake ad traffic while also pouring time and resources into tracking and shutting down the botnet. On top of that, Google claims the whole thing chips away at user trust, hurts its reputation, and cuts into profits.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung packed this year's Fold with enough upgrades to actually make people reconsider their usual Flip habit.</p><p>This Z Flip trend has made sense until now. The Z Fold lineup has always been nearly twice the price of the clamshell foldable. Plus, Samsung’s book-style foldables used to lag behind some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">leading foldables</a> from China in design innovation.</p><p>Still, the Z Fold 7’s current momentum isn’t all that surprising. It’s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-early-battery-impressions">big step up from the Fold 6</a>, seeing as it is noticeably thinner, lighter, and now the lightest book-style foldable out there. It’s also one of the slimmest foldables overall, and that major design overhaul is likely a big reason why more people are picking it up.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="789745c1-67d8-476e-9b83-341f4b10d184">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>For first-timers or longtime Fold users looking to upgrade, the Z Fold 7 stands out as Samsung’s strongest foldable yet in the U.S. That said, if you’ve already dropped cash on a large-screen foldable not too long ago, the $2,000 asking price might be hard to justify.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

That is, on their own. While I was thoroughly impressed by what the Buds 4 were able to offer at their price point, I couldn't help but think about the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 during my review period.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> are my go-to recommendation for value-first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds for Android</a>, and they currently cost about $150. When the OnePlus Buds 4 are at full price, they retail for $130. That isn't a lot of breathing room for OnePlus' new mid-tier earbuds.</p><p>At launch (and at the time of writing), you can use code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> to save $30 on the Buds 4 on the company's website, temporarily helping matters. With a price difference of about $50 between models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> and Buds Pro 3 can coexist. But when this deal expires, OnePlus has a problem.</p><p>At full price, I'd recommend everyone but those on the tightest of budgets spend an extra $20 on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, skipping the Buds 4. Here's why.</p><h2 id="all-the-hardware-differences-between-the-oneplus-buds-4-and-the-buds-pro-3-2">All the hardware differences between the OnePlus Buds 4 and the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-5" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 next to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a record stand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the OnePlus Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 on paper, there are a boatload of similarities. Both pairs of truly wireless earbuds use drivers with an 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter. They also each have dual digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and support the same AAC, SBC, and LDAC codecs. It's possible the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 even use similar or the exact same drivers, but I can't know for sure.</p><p>A key difference between the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 is their frequency response, and this will be important later. The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 can reproduce sounds between 10Hz and 40KHz, whereas the Buds 4 are a bit more limited, with a frequency response of 15Hz and 40KHz. In other words, the "Pro" earbuds can physically recreate more sounds accurately than the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-1" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 cases next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 have a more premium feel, with a faux leather case that I think makes them look better than any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market. Some might find OnePlus' faux leather looks to be tacky, and I can understand that. If you're deep in the ecosystem with a leather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, it can create a neat and cohesive experience.</p><p>They support wireless charging, which is a big omission by the OnePlus Buds 4. Overall, the OnePlus Buds 4 still look more like their Nord budget counterparts than a "Pro" pair of earbuds. They have a thicker, rectangular stem that lacks squeeze controls. Additionally, both the case and earbuds have a matte finish.</p><h2 id="how-the-oneplus-buds-4-sound-compared-to-the-buds-pro-3-2">How the OnePlus Buds 4 sound compared to the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-3" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 compared with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With similar audio drivers and noise-canceling hardware, it's no surprise that the OnePlus Buds 4 sound very close in quality to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Volume seems consistent against both pairs of earbuds, and they also have a strong bass representation. For some, this will be enough to make the OnePlus Buds 4 a viable alternative to the Buds Pro 3 — if you like loud, bass-heavy music, these will do the job.</p><p>Where the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 outshine the Buds 4 is in soundstage separation, clarity, and range. I mentioned the Buds Pro 3's expanded frequency response earlier, and I think you can really make it out this difference in casual listening. The low end is a bit fuller and doesn't encroach as much on the midrange space, whereas the OnePlus Buds 4 will give you similar sounds with less separation.</p><p>On top of that, the high end is way more pronounced, making it easy to enjoy the crisp sound of hitting a snare drum or cymbal separately from the rest of the instruments on the soundstage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-6" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is OnePlus Buds Pro 3 sounding slightly more polished than the Buds 4. Both are an excellent listen, and frankly, I'm impressed that the OnePlus Buds 4 got as close as they did to the Buds Pro 3 at their price point. Still, I can't help but feel like the Buds 4 can have bass that's <em>too</em> overwhelming.</p><p>Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling quality</a> is solid across both the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 and Buds 4. With three microphones per side on the Buds 4 and a real-time ANC algorithm, they should successfully block out unwanted noise while listening to music.</p><p>Both pairs of earbuds will get around four to six hours of battery life on their own, depending on your volume and whether ANC is on or off.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-nail-the-intangibles-while-the-buds-4-cut-corners-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 nail the intangibles, while the Buds 4 cut corners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-7" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although I prefer the sound of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, the difference is probably negligible for most listeners. Where the higher-end pair pulls away from the cheaper version is in their design. The Buds Pro 3 are more compact and feature a cylindrical stem, and they're much more comfortable than the blocky stem on the Buds 4. I get a better fit and, thus, a more enjoyable experience listening to the Buds Pro 3.</p><p>The Buds Pro 3 also have better on-earbud controls than the Buds 4, at least by my standards. You squeeze the stems on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to adjust playback or ANC modes, and swipe up or down on the front of them to raise or lower the volume.</p><p>These are more reliable and intuitive than the swipe and tap controls on the flat portion of the OnePlus Buds 4 stem. Rather than incorporate a squeeze function, the Buds 4 only use capacitive buttons with no tactile feedback.</p><p>Sometimes they're too sensitive, changing something while you're actually trying to adjust the fit of your earbuds. Other times, you have to push the side of the earbud stem hard to change the ANC mode, shoving the earbud uncomfortably in your ear.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-are-still-the-better-value-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the better value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-4" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on top of a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus upgraded the sound quality, ANC, and charging case for the Buds 4, but it may have pushed the earbuds too close to its standout Buds Pro 3. I can't imagine why you'd want to buy the Buds 4 over the Buds Pro 3 unless you can get a great deal. At their full price, I'd gladly pay an extra $20 for the Buds Pro 3, which have settled into a typical $150 price point about a year after their release.</p><p>You get a crisper and more diversified sound, a wider soundstage, better controls, and wireless charging just by going with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. This part is a bit subjective, but I think you get a more stylish and comfortable design, too.</p><p>Originally, it was unclear where the new OnePlus Buds 4 landed in quality compared to the Buds 3 and Buds Pro 3. It looked like the Buds 4 might have the chops to beat or match the Buds Pro 3 on paper. But after spending a few weeks with both pairs of earbuds, it's clear that the Buds Pro 3 still have a clear edge. Unless you can snag the Buds 4 for $100 or less, the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the best value in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless Android earbuds</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c1162bc-cffb-4a99-adbd-5dfef51635ca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwVEiC32nwm2QHvnHgrch8.jpg' alt="The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the best</strong></em></p><p>The Buds Pro 3 are still the best OnePlus earbuds you can buy, even if the similar Buds 4 made things a bit confusing.

Before the Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumor mill started ramping up, I had hope that Samsung would make things better than the last three iterations.</p><p>Needless to say, those hopes were quickly dashed as soon as we caught wind of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Fold Special Edition</a>. It too shared the same measly 4,400mAh battery that Samsung seemingly has a surplus of, or just refuses to let go of. As such, that's exactly what we've got here in the Fold 7.</p><p>Fortunately, just like the ones that came before it, battery life has been pretty solid. However, I don't suspect that to be the case for long.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-solid-for-now-2">Battery life is solid... for now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before I get too far ahead of myself here, let's talk about how things have been going so far. I've had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> for a little over a week, and I think things are finally starting to settle in a bit. Battery life always takes a hit over the first couple of days, between downloading apps, restoring data, and everything else in between.</p><p>Since then, I've been pretty happy with the Fold 7, as it manages to keep up with me throughout the day, even with an abhorrent sleeping pattern that starts between 7-9 and ends somewhere after 3 a.m. Obviously, some days are better than others, but that would be the case even if this were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energizeyourdevice.com/en/news/detail/">Energizer P28K</a> with its 28,000mAh battery.</p><h2 id="could-samsung-have-done-better-2">Could Samsung have done better?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Dg9yvAhLvzpXq7mUzVyDx3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Circle to Search mid-game hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dg9yvAhLvzpXq7mUzVyDx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to actual battery life, I ran two abbreviated versions of my battery-draining test. The test itself is simply playing a 4K HDR video with the screen on, and then setting hourly timers to check the battery life.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Spec</p></th><th  ><p>Setting</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Adaptive Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Off</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wi-Fi</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Light Mode</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Timeout</p></td><td  ><p>10 minutes (Max allowed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Motion smoothness</p></td><td  ><p>Adaptive</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Volume</p></td><td  ><p>50%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And instead of just running it on one screen or the other, I started the test on the cover display, and then ran it again from the big screen.  Here's how everything played out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Screen</p></th><th  ><p>Time Starting</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage</p></th><th  ><p>Difference</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover</p></td><td  ><p>12:13</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>1:13</p></td><td  ><p>62%</p></td><td  ><p>~15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Main</p></td><td  ><p>2:34</p></td><td  ><p>42%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>3:34</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td><td  ><p>~29%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It shouldn't be too surprising that the battery drained more when performing the test from the larger main display. There are simply more pixels to power, but I did double-check my math, because I didn't expect the Fold 7 to drain twice as fast. Then again, besides being larger, the main screen also has a 2184 x 1968 resolution, compared to the 2520 x 1080 resolution of the cover display.</p><p>Although I doubt many will be watching videos under these specific circumstances, it doesn't bode well for the Fold 7's battery longevity. I'm not really surprised or disappointed in what I've seen so far, as it's just what I expected, even with the efficiency gains provided by the new chip.</p><p>Which brings me back to my concerns with Samsung opting for the 4,400mAh for another year. I think there's probably a prototype somewhere in the labs that has the same screen sizes as the Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">S Pen support</a>, flagship-level cameras, and at least a 5,000mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC" name="honor-magic-v5-side-profile-closed-render" alt="Side profile view of the Honor Magic V5 closed, showing how thin it is" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3017" height="1697" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why not just throw caution to the wind and release the ultimate foldable? Because the mass market dictates otherwise. There's currently a race to release the thinnest foldable possible, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-than-honors-magic-v5-test-claim-report">there seems to be a debate</a> about whether the Magic V5 holds the title or if it now belongs to Samsung. No matter who the current claim-holder actually is, these phones are razor-thin and incredible feats of technology.</p><p>But when you consider that the Magic V5 has a battery capacity that's almost 40% larger than the Fold 7, I can't help but wonder why. A lot of that has to do with much of Samsung's competition beginning to integrate "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon</a>" batteries, which support faster charging and are said to be more efficient. Samsung continues to rely on a more traditional dual-cell lithium-ion battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6034" height="2586" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think Samsung probably took a look at where the market was trending and then used the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition as a "testing" device. Since it had a positive reception, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone makers</a> were focusing on getting thinner, that's the route that Samsung took.</p><p>As for why Samsung didn't take the leap into using a different battery technology, I don't know. There's probably a well-constructed and semi-logical answer that Samsung would give. But I'm more of the mindset that the company will do whatever it takes to avoid another Note 7 scenario, despite it being almost ten years later.</p><h2 id="the-short-term-future-looks-bleak-2">The short-term future looks bleak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-cases-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've made it this far without talking about wireless charging, and that's simply because I haven't been using wireless charging. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">magnetic aspect of Qi2</a> isn't built into the phone, probably for the sake of being thin. And frankly, while I own non-magnetic wireless chargers, I haven't dug one out yet for testing.</p><p>Ultimately, what makes me so disappointed with this decision has nothing to do with my <em>current</em> experiences with the Fold 7. It's all about 3 months, 6 months, or one year from now. The battery will degrade; it's just science, and it happens with every phone. But for as much as I've enjoyed using the Fold 7 so far, I also know in the back of my head that it's only a matter of time before the tires start to go flat.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="483ae2e2-63b3-42cf-8e1d-0bbc2db4b20c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The thinnest* foldable phone</strong></em></p><p>There's no denying how incredible the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is, just from a technological perspective.

The Astra is a mid-range tablet with a stylish design that's in line with the brand's phones, and it runs the latest Qualcomm silicon alongside an 8,200mAh battery.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the Astra comes with an OLED panel.

The Astra has excellent in-hand feel; the sizing is just right, and it isn't uncomfortable in the least. It isn't too heavy at 370g either, and I didn't have any issues using the tablet for hours on end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Tp8i8aTm9GMdwC3EbJxSDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tp8i8aTm9GMdwC3EbJxSDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's particularly great is that the tablet has a flat back with no camera protrusion whatsoever — just like the 10S Pro — and that alone makes it much better to use. There's no wobble when using the Astra on a table, and the 6.9mm width along the sides along with rounded edges make it easy to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JPtXrAPQmJuKscXjuoQuDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JPtXrAPQmJuKscXjuoQuDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The build quality is excellent; the mid-frame is made out of aluminum as well, and I didn't see any problems whatsoever in the month I used the tablet.

I like that Redmagic went with a 9.06-inch OLED panel instead of the usual 11 or 12-inch tablets that are standard; the smaller size makes the Astra that much more portable, but you still get adequate screen real estate.</p><h2 id="this-is-a-gaming-powerhouse-2">This is a gaming powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G53X6UKdcakfwjGBLd3kKF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G53X6UKdcakfwjGBLd3kKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The panel itself is fantastic; it has a resolution of 2400 x 1504, and it goes up to 165Hz refresh in select games. The OLED panel has outstanding color vibrancy and contrast, and it's a definite point of differentiation. You also get LTPO tech and 5,280Hz PWM dimming, and it gets bright enough that I didn't notice any issues even under sunlight. It's not a tandem OLED panel like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, but it is better than any other Android tablet I used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gaming on the Astra is a real delight, and the tablet handles demanding titles without breaking a sweat. It uses an active cooling solution (a small fan that's located at the back) alongside an innovative thermal management system, and the result is that it doesn't throttle even under load. It tends to overheat at times, but it isn't anywhere as uncomfortable as a gaming phone thanks to the larger surface area, and this was only an issue while running 3DMark's stress tests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is the most affordable way to get your hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the U.S., and the gaming tablet lives up to its potential. I got the 16GB/512GB model, and I believe this is the sweet spot; all models come with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.1 storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4kgcEo85gTViwb3Nc5qHF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4kgcEo85gTViwb3Nc5qHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like Redmagic's gaming phones, the Astra delivers high refresh rate gaming in select titles, and that makes it highly enjoyable. The onboard sound gets loud and detailed, and there's a Magic Key on the side that's customizable. The tablet gets a fingerprint reader along with face unlock, and it's fast to authenticate. The vibration motor is pretty good too, and it has decent feedback.</p><p>Thanks to an 8,200mAh battery, the Astra easily lasts a few days with regular use, and it delivers nearly eight hours of gaming. It takes just over 80 minutes to charge the device thanks to 80W charging, but there isn't a charger included in the package.</p><h2 id="software-that-you-actually-want-to-use-2">Software that you actually want to use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tablet runs Redmagic OS 10.5 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the software has good fluidity and not much in the way of overt styling. There's enough customizability should you need it, and I like that Redmagic cleaned up its interface in the last 18 months. There isn't any unnecessary AI bloat either, with Redmagic instead teaming up with Google to deliver Gemini and real-time translation and editing utilities.</p><p>The only issue is that the Astra will get just two software updates, and that limits its long-term usability. The hardware should easily last a half-decade at least without any noticeable slowdowns, and Redmagic really needs to do better. Other than that, the only other omission is 5G connectivity — the Astra doesn't get any cellular modem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Mf8ziuLu7MgNEYeiiCQUDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mf8ziuLu7MgNEYeiiCQUDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Astra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-gaming-tablets">best Android gaming tablet</a> available today.

The big-screen foldable is thinner and lighter while being more powerful, with a flagship processor and main camera. It helps Samsung pull ahead of Google in the foldable race — at least for now. While it looks like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 tops the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google will have the chance to respond with the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google recently set a launch event for Aug. 20, so the official Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveal isn't too far away. Rumors and leaks don't point to Google overhauling its next foldable to the extent Samsung just did. Still, that doesn't mean the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't be a better foldable for some people. Let's review how the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will compare to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, based on the latest speculative information available.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-in-hand-back" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5326" height="2996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event</a> penciled in for Aug. 20, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> is nearing an official launch. It'll likely be revealed on that date alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. The phone could be made available for pre-order that same day, with general availability beginning Aug. 28. However, it's worth noting that Google took some extra time releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> last year, so its successor may debut after the rest of the lineup.</p><p>Pricing for the new foldable is up in the air, with earlier rumors suggesting Google could shave hundreds off the sticker price. More recently, there's talk of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold keeping its $1,799 price tag. Either way, the phone will likely cost less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">you can purchase now for $1,999</a>. That gets you the base model with 256GB of memory and 12GB of RAM, and it's generally available as of July 25, 2025.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be available in two colors, Moonstone and Jade.

It'll likely have the same general form factor, an identically-sized main display, and similar dimensions compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This is reflected in leaked product renders for the device, created based on rumors and leaks. Of course, things can change, but we're not expecting many surprises when it comes to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's design.</p><p>There are a few key upgrades to point out. The cover screen may grow slightly to 6.4 inches, with the hinge assembly and bezels possibly shrinking to accommodate the larger display. It'll still be an AMOLED display panel supporting 120Hz refresh rates, but the screen's brightness capabilities will be upped to reach 3,000 nits, according to leaks. Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the first foldable IP68-certified against dust and water ingress.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-waterproof">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 does have an IP48 rating</a> for dust and water-resistance, it doesn't have the highest level of dust protection like the Pixel might.

It'll be an AMOLED panel capable of variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz and 2,700 nits of peak brightness, at least. The inner screen could come with a brightness increase to match the outer screen, but that's not confirmed.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 also has an 8-inch AMOLED screen, although the aspect ratio is closer to square than the Pixel. It supports 120Hz variable refresh rates and has a lower 2,600-nit peak brightness rating. Still, both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold will almost certainly have stunning displays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Galaxy AI image generation hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless Google pulls off a miracle, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Samsung made its latest foldable just 8.9mm thick when folded, and it weighs only 215 grams. By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to measure somewhere around 10.5mm thick when folded and weigh roughly 257 grams. Those figures are based on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold dimensions, and current rumors and leaks don't point to major changes.</p><p>On one hand, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was already pretty thin, so the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't feel insanely thick. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is likely to be over a millimeter thinner than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and that difference is hard to ignore.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's possible the biggest Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold upgrade is on the inside.

Although the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will likely ship with more RAM by default (16GB) than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (12GB), the latter should have better performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 </p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch OLED, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152 resolution, 373 ppi, 2700 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2184 x 1968 QXGA+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch OLED, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2520 x 1080 HD+, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2)</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.5MP ultrawide + 10.8MP telephoto (5x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Folded ( 77.1 x 155.2 x 10.5 mm); Unfolded (150.2 x 155.2 x 5.1 mm)</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (folded); 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (unfolded)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>257g</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade</p></td><td  ><p>Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, Jetblack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both phones will come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box. Samsung is using One UI 8 on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is based on Android 16. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will get Google flair with Pixel UI.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is reportedly getting a major battery boost. It is rumored to feature a 5,015mAh capacity. Paired with a more efficient Tensor G5 platform, this could combine to make for impressive battery life gains. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400mAh battery — but it does have faster wired charging speeds.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't expected to come with any camera hardware upgrades. That would give buyers a 48MP main sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens capable of 5x optical zoom. Meanwhile, Samsung swapped the Galaxy Z Fold 7's main camera sensor for a new 200MP lens this year. It also sports a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Both phones are rumored to have 10MP front-facing cameras on both the main and cover screens.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-should-you-buy-now-or-wait-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Should you buy now or wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When considering a new foldable for 2025 and beyond, it's worth remembering that Google and Samsung aren't in sync. While Samsung just gave the Galaxy Z Fold a major overhaul this year, Google's big revamp to the Pixel Fold occurred last year. The jump from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is equivalent to the leap from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. As such, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't be a major upgrade, but that was expected.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will likely be the better device on paper, as it packs a more powerful chipset and a better main camera sensor. Additionally, it's thinner and lighter, and some would say Samsung's foldable build quality is better than Google's. The price tag starting at $2,000 means that, at the very least, there will be $200 of separation between Samsung and Google foldables.</p><p>If you're looking for a great foldable that doesn't cost you a fortune, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be the better option. It would also have the advantages of running Pixel UI, featuring a more inviting design language, and a wider display aspect ratio. Even with that in mind, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will win on the spec sheet every time.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6a75c679-08f2-461c-9640-fb43d324cecb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg' alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An iterative upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the major leap the Galaxy Z Fold 7 was, but that's in part because its predecessor was already an outstanding device.

They always say "pending regulatory approval," but what does that really mean?</strong></em></p><p>Hi Roger, and thanks for writing in and asking! Since so many people use a wearable device for health and fitness, this is an interesting and important question.</p><p>The easy answer is that manufacturers mean what they say — they do not have approval to sell a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable</a> with a specific feature (hypothetically, say, sleep apnea detection) in all countries, so it's launching in those countries without that ability.</p><p>Often, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">approval is granted</a> and the feature comes with a software update, but not always. It's easy to blame the manufacturers; Samsung or Google should do whatever is needed to get those features out for everyone. But it's not really up to them.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-is-already-there-2">The hardware is already there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Companies usually don't make a different version of the product for different countries. If you buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> in France and it can monitor your breathing during sleep, it could also do it in the United States as far as the hardware is concerned. Sometimes, even the software is there, buried and hidden, because it can't be used. But usually it's not.</p><p>We see phones built differently for different parts of the world, but wearables are a more integrated platform with more stringent hardware requirements, so it's best to just make them all the same. Your watch has the same chips and sensors inside as one sold anywhere else, even if the features are slightly different.</p><h2 id="blame-the-government-2">Blame the government</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-us-fda.jpg" alt="Samsung announced it has gained U.S. FDA approval for its sleep apnea detection." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm sure every country around the world has some sort of regulatory body that governs the use of medical devices intended to be worn or implanted. Yes, if your wearable tries to detect or diagnose a specific health condition, it is considered a medical device. I'm only really familiar with how it works in the U.S., but I imagine the process is similar everywhere else.</p><p>In the U.S., if you build your own medical device, write your own software, and use it <em>yourself</em>, you do not need any sort of approval from anyone. Nobody is doing this, of course, but the provision is there because it needs to be — someone needs to test things during the product development stage.</p><p>Once you make your device or software available for others, and <em>especially</em> if you put it up for sale, you need to jump through all sorts of hoops. For health features, this means the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) decides.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/wearables-fda-and-patient-advice-what-physicians-should-know" target="_blank">FDA says</a> that any device “<em>intended for use in the diagnosis of disease of other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</em>” requires FDA approval. Wearable devices are not regulated if they are intended only for general wellness uses. <strong>All</strong> implanted devices require approval.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung just went through this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-sleep-apnea-galaxy-watch-more-users-globally">sleep apnea detection</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch</a> last fall.

Of course, they can't enforce this, but once it's in print, Samsung is following the rules.</p><p>Once all this happens, we can use our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch</a> to tell us if we stop breathing during the night once we receive a software update that enables the feature.</p><h2 id="why-not-wait-until-it-s-approved-2">Why not wait until it's approved?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a simple answer — companies don't hold back products for this because they want to sell products, and you don't want to wait for it to be approved.</p><p>Most people didn't buy a Galaxy Watch only because they wanted to monitor for sleep apnea. I'd say the people who really wanted this feature are just a small percentage of users. I like it, you may like it, most people just don't care.</p><p>None of those people could have bought a Galaxy Watch if it weren't available, and would have bought a different model. Waiting until September of last year to release the device would have meant a lot of missed sales from people who didn't plan to use sleep apnea detection in the first place. That's not good for business.</p><p>It's worth noting that some companies, such as Samsung and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too" target="_blank">Apple</a>, are able to obtain approval much faster than others. It shouldn't be that way, but it is. My best guess is these large companies have a relationship with the right people and a good understanding of the entire process.</p><p>That said, there are some features, such as blood pressure monitoring, that even these companies haven't been able to weasel their way into getting FDA-approved.</p><p>If the next wearable you want launches minus a health feature or two, don't be afraid to buy it anyway. Approval is probably coming; it's just that the government only has one speed — a slow one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The AI revolution has mostly shaken up the software world, with specialized AI hardware devices flopping — we haven't forgotten the disasters that were the Humane AI Pin or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> just yet.</p><p>When a new AI device pops up, contrarians are quick to point out that it "could've been an app." Sometimes that's true, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-not-just-an-app">sometimes it's not</a>. AI voice recorders are particularly gaining traction among those who want new bleeding-edge hardware, and Plaud is leading the charge. The company's Note and NotePin devices aim to go with you daily to record conversations, meetings, and notes, transcribing them later in the Plaud app.</p><p>I wore the Plaud NotePin on my wrist for a week to figure out whether it's really a helpful companion, or an overpriced AI product that, well, could've been an app. Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="plaud-nailed-the-notepin-s-design-and-form-factor-2">Plaud nailed the NotePin's design and form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-2" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't impressed by the respective form factors of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">AI Pin</a> or the Rabbit R1. They looked too bulky and inconvenient to wear or carry daily. With these kinds of devices, they're only useful if you <em>actually</em> want to carry them. An AI assistant or voice recorder is of no use if you forget it at home or it's buried in a bag.</p><p>Luckily, Plaud struck the right balance of utility and compactness with the NotePin. It's a small, pill-shaped device that can conform to be worn in a few different form factors. There's a smartwatch-like wristband, a lanyard necklace, a clip, and a magnetic "pin" option included in the accessory kit. It's worth noting that only the pin and clip are included with the NotePin — the other items will cost extra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-3" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wore the wristband most often, as it's incredibly comfortable and unobtrusive for anyone used to wearing watches daily. It might look a bit strange wearing a NotePin on one wrist and a smartwatch on the other, but I did it anyway.</p><p>With up to 40 days of standby time and up to 20 hours of continuous recording, you should be able to wear your NotePin for plenty of time in between charges. I found those battery life estimates to be very generous — you will probably need to charge more often than that. But with only two hours needed to recharge, it won't be much of a hassle.</p><h2 id="plaud-s-pricing-model-is-extremely-hard-to-justify-2">Plaud's pricing model is extremely hard to justify</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-5" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI hardware products are extremely difficult to price out. Devices that rely on cloud servers incur ongoing costs for the companies supporting those off-device features. While subscriptions aren't fun, I actually think they're necessary for AI hardware. A product being sold with a one-time, upfront cost is almost certain to be bricked in the long run — the economics almost necessitate that.</p><p>Plaud went with the worst of both worlds for its NotePin pricing model. It has an extremely high upfront cost for what it is, retailing for $159. On top of that, you'll need to pay for a subscription to unlock all AI features beyond the initial free trial period. Plaud's AI Pro plan costs $100 per year and still comes with rate limits. The AI Unlimited tier costs $240 per year for the full, unabridged experience.</p><p>To put it lightly, this pricing model is insane. With the unlimited plan, your first year of using the NotePin would cost $399, and that's before any extra accessories. Using it beyond that would incur greater subscription fees over time.</p><p>The subscription model isn't the issue. The problem is that you can't ask customers to pay extreme hardware costs <em>and</em> subscription fees. Plaud <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">should've followed in Whoop's footsteps</a>, including the hardware for free while charging monthly for its subscription plan.</p><h2 id="the-recording-and-transcription-features-are-fine-but-not-outstanding-2">The recording and transcription features are fine, but not outstanding</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-4" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't help that I wasn't blown away by Plaud's ability to record my conversations and transcribe them. The Plaud NotePin didn't do a bad job by any means, but it wasn't outstanding, and it needed to be to justify its cost.</p><p>The way it works is simple: you long-press the NotePin to start recording, press again to stop recording, and let the recording upload to the Plaud app on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. After that, it'll need to be uploaded to the cloud for processing and returned to your device.</p><p>Like anything dependent on the cloud, this will take time. While uploading and transcribing your recording, the app says it'll take "a few minutes to complete" and that it will "continue if you navigate away from this page." So, I closed the app for about 10 minutes, let Plaud do its thing, and checked back in.</p><p>Instead of seeing a summary, I received a new message stating, "The network is unstable, it may take a little longer than expected." That was unusual, so I ran an internet speed test on my phone. Sure enough, my download speed was 891Mbps at the time that message appeared, which is more than fast enough for what the Plaud app was trying to do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-Screenshot" alt="Screenshots of the Plaud app trying to transcribe my recording." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt like Plaud was trying to pass the buck on the user for its slow processing times, since my Wi-Fi 6E connection certainly wasn't the issue. The 10-minute waiting period for a roughly 30-minute conversation to process was frustrating enough, but playing the blame game was even worse.</p><p>To be clear, it wasn't all bad. Most transcriptions took about three to five minutes to process, which still isn't fantastic but is passable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V38CV99aPRiWJpuYueCiWN" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-6" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V38CV99aPRiWJpuYueCiWN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the Plaud app provides more detailed transcriptions than any voice recorder app I've used. It creates an organized summary of the conversation and identifies the name of each speaker.</p><p>Beyond that, you get a mind map showing the flow of the entire conversation, plus an outline with isolated topics you can jump to at any time. Plaud also has an AI chatbot that can answer specific questions about your voice recordings, which some users might find really helpful.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-a-matter-of-if-android-apps-can-do-it-better-2">It's not a matter of if — Android apps CAN do it better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zJwgWeVhkLTqmjWZ2Z2Lni" name="Pixel-Recorder-1" alt="The Google Recorder app on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJwgWeVhkLTqmjWZ2Z2Lni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this case, it does feel like the Plaud NotePin could have been an app, as clichéd as that might sound. Something that uses on-device processing, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a> Nano model, would be infinitely better than Plaud's reliance on the cloud.

For one, I might have to wait as long as 10 minutes for the NotePin to transfer, upload, and process recordings. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL was transcribing my conversation <em>instantly</em> while I was speaking.</p><p>It's true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is expensive, but the phone you already have in your pocket probably supports this feature. Apple, Google, and Samsung all offer apps that do the same thing, and they're included with your phone for free. You could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">refurbished Pixel 7a</a> for under $200 to get the Google Recorder app for much less than a full year of paying for the Plaud NotePin and its unlimited subscription plan.</p><p>I've been a loyal Google Recorder user since 2022, when I started using it alongside the Pixel 7 series. After switching to the Plaud NotePin for a week, I don't feel a strong incentive to replace it with a Pixel for my recording needs. With a Pixel phone, Google Recorder, and Gemini, you can get a similar experience with no subscription.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8b417990-b4f7-463a-b689-631bfad5b6db">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmh2uy3VvdtG6HpLc2Ao2d.jpg' alt="The Plaud NotePin in a white render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Plaud NotePin</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A tough sell</strong></em></p><p>The Plaud NotePin is relatively good at what it does, but you'll need to be comfortable with long transcription times, a high up-front cost, and recurring subscription fees.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Limoncello leans into the yellow-green combo we've seen in earlier leaks; Indigo takes after the Bay blue and darkens it up, and Frost lands somewhere between light blue and a soft purple tint.</p><h2 id="ditching-the-chill-tones-2">Ditching the chill tones</h2><p>The latest leak suggests Google is taking a more daring turn with its design. While past models, like the Pixel 9, leaned into subtle tones, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> lineup looks way more vivid and saturated. The tech giant is clearly not shying away from color this time, possibly aiming to give the Pixel 10 a more confident look that grabs attention right out of the gate.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in blue (Indigo)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in lime (Limoncello)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in black (Obsidian)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting takeaway from the Pixel 10 leak is that Porcelain (Google’s go-to white or off-white shade) might be getting the axe. It’s been a staple across Pixel releases, but its absence this time around, possibly in favor of cooler tones like Frost, points to Google leaning into a more colorful direction with its design choices.</p><p>There was talk earlier that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">might tie certain Pixel 10 colors to specific storage options</a>. The base model was rumored to stick with 128GB, while the Pixel 10 Pro could start at 256GB or higher. If that holds true, colors like Limoncello might only show up on certain configurations. This means your storage choice could end up deciding your color, too.</p><h2 id="telephoto-for-the-base-model-2">Telephoto for the base model?</h2><p>The renders also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">corroborate recent rumors that Google may have reworked the Pixel 10’s camera setup</a>. The glass section on the camera bar is now wider, making room for a third lens: a telephoto, which is surprisingly showing up on the standard Pixel 10 this time.</p><p>But there’s a trade-off: adding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/camera-specs-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-hinting-at-a-significant-downgrade">telephoto lens might come at the cost of smaller sensors elsewhere</a>. Reports suggest the main rear camera could drop from 50MP to 48MP, and the ultrawide might shrink from 48MP to just 12MP.</p><p>In related news, Google has just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">teased the Pixel 10 series on its official store</a>. With launch day getting closer, we’ll probably see even more leaks roll out, shedding light on the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication was able to snag the image before the takedown occurred. Blass suggests that the device will feature a design that mirrors what Samsung launched with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. While it's a very Apple reminiscent design (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">something execs have criticised</a>), the company appears to want a continuation of it, at least for now.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE could see the same stick stabilizer to help when worn, with silicon tips, just like the Buds 3 Pro. Samsung called this a "Blade design" when the Buds 3 series launched last year.</p><p>The buds are shown off in white, although it's unclear if they will be glossy like the base Galaxy Buds 3 or more matte, like the 3 Pro. Blass didn't allege anything like specs or potential pricing. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">Galaxy Buds FE</a> debuted two years ago for $99. However, considering Samsung might pack in its Galaxy AI (and probably Gemini), there's no telling if that price will go up a little whenever it launches.</p><h2 id="fe-for-the-rest-2">FE for the rest?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.46%;"><img id="gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of the alleged Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in white with black silicon tips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1017" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also another major distinction between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">the Buds 3 Pro</a> and the base model: Samsung's blade lights. The Pro variant offers "Blade Lights" along the stabilizer that act as a bit of extra flair. Users can have these lights on continuously (stable) or have them fade in and out. Samsung's base 3 Pro doesn't offer this extra flair, so it remains to be seen <em>if </em>the Galaxy Buds 3 FE bring that in.</p><p>Although considering the "FE" tag, perhaps not. Additionally, we can likely expect the same blade design media and call controls to remain, just like its flagship counterparts.</p><p>You might've missed this, but Samsung recently dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-teases-its-new-galaxy-buds-ahead-of-launch">a pair of cheap earbuds</a>, dubbed the Galaxy Buds Core, overseas in India and other regions. It's unclear if these buds will see a global launch or make their way to the U.S., but considering we're seeing Galaxy Buds 3 FE rumors, <em>maybe </em>there are other plans.</p><p>A more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/leaked-renders-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-galaxy-s25-fe-changes-rumored">recent leak dropped renders</a> for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 FE. It seems both devices are in for some subtle design changes, such as an Infinity-U camera cutout for the Tab S11 Ultra's front camera and the potential removal of its S Pen slot on its back. For the S25 FE, it looks like Samsung is bringing its shiny silvery rings to its camera lenses, instead of the black rings like the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>There's speculation that the Korean OEM is looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">debut its tablet series "shortly"</a> following Unpacked, and this could bring the S25 FE with it.

Once again, the company confirms that its Made by Google event to reveal the next Pixel line will occur on August 20. What's most important in this teaser is Google's official look at the Pixel 10's design.</p><p>The header confirms the series will look pretty similar to the Pixel 9 series, boasting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">rather large camera bump</a>, flat sides, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's unclear which device Google's teasing. The model features three lenses, which could point us toward the Pixel 10 Pro or 10 Pro XL devices. However, there were rumors that the base model would grab a third lens, moving it closer to the company's higher-tier Pixels. Additionally, Google is offering an "exclusive offer" for new users who subscribe to its store's emails.</p><p>If you've freshly signed up, Google states you will receive a promotional code on August 20 (the day of the event). Its fine print adds, "Use of promo code is limited to a discount on one eligible device." Users have from today (July 21) to August 18 to sign up for Google Store emails and be eligible for its promo code on August 20.</p><h2 id="big-pixel-10-2">Big (Pixel) 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.88%;"><img id="Fsxbd9EpN34xPPfL4x8dG8" name="google-pixel-10-number-teaser" alt="The number "10" as seen during Google's official Pixel 10 teaser." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fsxbd9EpN34xPPfL4x8dG8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1884" height="902" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There were two sets of camera rumors about the Pixel 10, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">first surfacing in June</a>, stating the series' telephoto lens could double as a macro camera.

A Google spokesperson reached out to Android Central, stating, "We’re actively working to fix an issue that is affecting media playback controls on Google Maps."</p><p>We all know that Google Maps is one of the most popular navigation apps, be it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iOS handsets, allowing users to connect to their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> like YouTube Music and Spotify for easy access while navigating. The handy controls gave users the ability to play/pause music and skip or go to previous tracks. Having the music playback controls while navigating is one such convenience that Maps offers, which surprisingly has gone missing in the latest update.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/19/google-maps-media-controls/">9to5Google</a> now finds that the handy controls, normally found under the Navigation settings of the Maps app, have seemingly been removed, along with the toggle to “Show media playback controls.”</p><p>Additionally, the option to set the music streaming service is missing from the latest version of the Google Maps app. It seemingly applies to the latest v25.28 version alongside the beta 25.29 version. I couldn’t find the same, as I also checked on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> running the same stable version of Google Maps.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-not-available" alt="Google Maps without playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps without playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-old" alt="Google Maps with playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps with playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Some Android Central staff also saw that the controls are still on certain devices, while missing from others. It remains unclear whether the removal of the most popular feature from Maps was a deliberate decision or an unintended bug. The feature, however, as 9to5 notes, is still available on the latest iOS version of Google Maps.</p><p>If it isn't a bug as anticipated and is intentional, it will follow the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-officially-killed-driving-mode-after-stripping-most-of-its-features-in-2024">removal of Assistant Driving mode</a>. It was removed as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> transition, and it also featured the media control bar similar to what Google Maps offers now.</p><p>However, with the Assistant Driving mode discontinued, having playback controls on Google Maps became handy. Well, that might not be the case anymore until the next update for the app rolls out, hopefully bringing back the popular feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
