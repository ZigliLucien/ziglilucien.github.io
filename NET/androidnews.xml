                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google&apos;s latest flagship lineup is here, and the Pixel 10 deals we&apos;ve seen so far have been absolute stunners. I personally don&apos;t like relying on trade-in credit to save money when I buy a new phone, so one phone deal in particular has captured my attention: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro"><strong>add a line with "most" plans at T-Mobile and the Big Three carrier will hook you up with $800 off the Google Pixel 10 Pro.</strong></a> No trade-in required!</p><p>This T-Mobile deal knocks the price of the AI-powered flagship down to only $199.99, or $8.33 per month for 24 months. For a limited time, T-Mobile is even waiving the $25 activation free when you shop online, so you could get the new Google Pixel 10 Pro for literally zero dollars down today. </p><h2 id="new-t-mobile-deal-drops-the-pixel-10-pro-into-budget-phone-territory-2">New T-Mobile deal drops the Pixel 10 Pro into budget phone territory</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a2a29269-e913-4f82-8373-2c6998a4e0c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-render-Moonstone-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" data-dimension112="a2a29269-e913-4f82-8373-2c6998a4e0c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99"><del>$999.99</del><strong> From $199.99 with most plans at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Add a line or upgrade with most plans at T-Mobile and the carrier will hook you up with $800 off the Google Pixel 10 Pro over 24 months. No trade-in is required, and T-Mobile will even waive the activation fee. The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released in 2025 so far, and this surprise deal makes the AI-boosted smartphone dirt cheap. </p><p>If you don't need this much power, it's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>T-Mobile is offering the same $800 discount on the base model Pixel 10</strong>,</a> effectively making that phone completely free with an eligible line. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a2a29269-e913-4f82-8373-2c6998a4e0c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> was announced alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup during a Made by Google event on August 20th. The phone is powered by the super-efficient Tensor G5 processor and comes with a gorgeous 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, 16GB of RAM, and 25W Qi2 magnetic charging (which is a rarity for Android devices). </p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro also boasts all of the AI-boosted camera features we&apos;ve come to expect from the OEM, plus I&apos;ve been enjoying the upgraded gaming performance (not to mention seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, but that&apos;s pretty standard these days). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Compared to last year&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro</a>, you&apos;ll also see some improvements in battery life and Android 16 right out of the box. </p><p>If I had to nitpick some flaws in the device, I&apos;d say that removing physical SIM support from the Pixel 10 series was a bad move, and 128GB of base storage also feels like a strange decision in this day and age. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM rate</a> is still bad if you&apos;re sensitive to that, and I&apos;m not sure if the Tensor G5 can match the performance of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Again, this is all pretty nitpicky stuff, and if you&apos;re already a fan of Pixel devices, the Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">plenty of offers</a> that can make the $999.99 flagship much cheaper (or even free), but if you want a straightforward carrier promotion that doesn&apos;t require a trade-in, T-Mobile&apos;s Pixel 10 Pro deal has the competition beat. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Back in 2020, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-quick-charge-5">Quick Charge 5 set the pace with over 100W of power</a>, which was enough to take a device from zero to 50% in about five minutes.</p><p>Now, Qualcomm says Quick Charge 5+ maintains the same fast performance while directly addressing the heat issues common with high-voltage charging.</p><h2 id="smarter-power-delivery-2">Smarter power delivery</h2><p>The upgrade adjusts voltage and current on the go, using up to 20V at 7A to deliver power with less heat buildup. This means your device can stay at top speeds for longer without throttling or cooking your battery.</p><p>Qualcomm also claims this will help extend battery life and keep performance steady even during demanding tasks like gaming or streaming.</p><p>Efficiency is another big focus. Quick Charge 5+ identifies what kind of device it’s plugged into and optimizes power delivery, which not only wastes less energy but could also lower costs for manufacturers.</p><p>Compared to other solutions that crank up voltage just to hit big wattage numbers, the new iteration takes a more balanced approach that avoids unnecessary heat and inefficiency.</p><h2 id="it-plays-well-with-others-2">It plays well with others</h2><p>Compatibility shouldn’t be an issue either. Quick Charge 5+ works with older Quick Charge gear (back to 2.0) and will play nice with upcoming devices set to debut at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomms-next-powerful-chip-gets-a-launch-date-in-september">Snapdragon Summit 2025 later this month</a>.</p><p>And you don’t need a Snapdragon-powered device to benefit, as it’s designed to match competitor chargers on non-Qualcomm hardware too. Accessories using the new standard are expected to start shipping later this year.</p><p>With Quick Charge 5+, Qualcomm wants to make fast charging more practical for real-world use. Cooler operation, smarter power handling, and broad compatibility could make this the go-to option for the next wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> and laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Amazon has codenamed these glasses "Amelia," and they are expected to look and work differently when compared to the consumer pair.</p><p>These driver-focused smart glasses are expected to display delivery instructions directly on their screens, guiding workers to parcel destinations, which minimizes the need for them to reach for their phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG" name="meta-hypernova-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of Meta Hypernova or Meta Celeste smart glasses and the sEMG wristband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1654" height="930" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna (@Lunayian) on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looks like Amazon might be stepping into Meta's territory with these new products, as the company is reportedly prepping to unveil a couple of new smartglasses, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-hypernova">Hypernova smart glasses, </a>the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Gen-3 Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses,</a> at the Meta Connect conference on September 17th.</p><p>The source told The Information that the e-commerce giant is using AR display technology from a Chinese firm called Meta-Bounds.

It's not direct blood pressure monitoring, but that almost makes Apple's new system more compelling — and rival brands will be scrambling to emulate it.</p><p>Users in Europe or Asia can get smartwatch-based blood pressure tracking with a Huawei Watch D2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> (with a cuff). But unless you're aware of chronic high blood pressure issues, you may not take advantage of this tool often. And a smartwatch won't replace a medical-grade blood pressure monitor.</p><p>I won't downplay the usefulness of convenient, on-the-go smartwatch BP checks for anyone unwilling to go to a doctor. But since Samsung has never gotten FDA approval — and several clinical studies with Galaxy Watches showed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"insufficient accuracy"</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"substantial pre-post calibration BP difference"</a> — it's not something I'd actively recommend to at-risk relatives, even if I could.</p><p>Samsung also has a newer, indirect method of predicting hypertension — its Vascular Load stat — but it's not as straightforward as Apple's method, which will come to "more than 150 countries and regions," including the U.S. and EU this month, and pass FDA clearance "soon."</p><p>Once it does, I could see the Apple Watch Series 11 becoming even more popular than past models. Anyone in an at-risk age group, or whose family is predisposed to chronic high blood pressure, will want these early warning signs.</p><h2 id="apple-found-a-depressingly-common-condition-to-predict-2">Apple found a depressingly common condition to predict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE" name="apple-hypertension-alert" alt="A render of the Apple Watch Series 11 showing a "possible hypertension" pop-up, with an iPhone next to it showing more details on "patterns related to hypertension" from the last 30 days of heart data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html">CDC</a> reports that 119.9 million American adults, or 48.1%, suffer from hypertension, while only 27 million have their condition "under control." 34 million Americans with hypertension had yet to fill or start taking their prescriptions. And "1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure is unaware of it and would not report having it."</p><p>Hypertension was a "primary or contributing cause of 664,470 deaths" in the United States in 2023, primarily from heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. Worldwide, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension">WHO</a> estimates 1.28 billion people have hypertension, with only 42% "diagnosed and treated."</p><p>These numbers speak for themselves. Chronic high blood pressure is painfully common, and the people with it either aren't aware or aren't willing to treat themselves, whether due to financial concerns or because they're otherwise healthy and assume they don't need to worry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE" name="apple-watch-series-11-hypertension" alt="A render of two Apple Watch Series 11 models, one showing a Sleep Score, the other showing a "Possible Hypertension" alert." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For something like sleep apnea or AFib, a smartwatch alert is obviously useful, but at least these conditions have physical symptoms that you could detect on your own. With hypertension, Apple correctly notes in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/">press release</a>, it "often has no symptoms" and "can be easily missed" if you only get readings once a year at the doctor's office.</p><p>Apple used "training data from multiple studies totaling over 100,000 participants," synced up against a "clinical study of over 2,000 participants," to make its machine learning algorithm. It'll then compare 30 days of optical HR data against its own data to spot any warning signs.</p><p>Apple predicts that out of the millions of users with an Apple Watch S9, S10, S11, Ultra 2, or Ultra 3, it'll spot signs of hypertension in a million people "within the first year."</p><p>That could very well prove hyperbolic, and I'll side-eye Apple if the FDA takes long to validate the feature. However, I'm truly optimistic that this could end up being a widespread tool, building awareness for a pervasive and dangerous condition. Regardless of which smartwatch brand you're a fan of, that's a great thing.</p><h2 id="android-and-fitness-watches-have-their-own-life-saving-tools-2">Android and fitness watches have their own life-saving tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Vascular-Load" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who wears a Galaxy Watch 8,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review"> Watch 8 Classic</a>, or Watch Ultra 24/7 will get Samsung's Vascular Load data, which takes your sleep data and "measures blood volume and vascular stiffness and precisely analyzes changes in stress on blood vessels."</p><p>Arterial stiffness is one potential sign of hypertension, among other heart conditions. But Samsung's Vascular Load graph is more about pointing out how lifestyle choices like sodium intake or drinking cause heart strain in the short term, and while that's valid, it also puts the onus on the user to get better scores when the true cause might be genetic. Plus, it focuses on sleep strain, not necessarily strain during the day.</p><p>I think Samsung could end up launching something more targeted to hypertension in the future, based on the data it collects now, and it <em>should</em>.

If no one is around to report it, this could save your life, though it's obviously a last resort for someone with unresolved health issues.</p><p>On the preventative front, Samsung, Google/Fitbit, Withings, and Apple offer passive irregular heart rhythm warnings. More brands offer ECGs for active AFib data, but you may not use them after getting one "normal" sinus reading; passive data is vital for making more people aware they should check their heart regularly, just like hypertension alerts point people toward using a BP machine.</p><p>It's clearer than ever that we're entering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical era of wearables</a>. Samsung is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">virtual doctor visits and prescription management</a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> adds better temperature sensors to catch people "falling under the weather."</p><p>Apple's hypertension alerts are just the latest strike in this battle, but it's an impressive one. Knowing if you or loved ones are at risk for stroke, heart failure, or other conditions will intrigue a lot of people.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Apple might not realize it, there is a world outside of the walled gardens in Cupertino, and we spotted a few things that Apple "stole" from Android during the event.</p><p>However, we have to admit, compared to years past, this list is a lot lighter than we expected. Usually, we can stick to the confines of the iPhone, but this year, we had to broaden the horizon a bit more.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-thin-phone-2">An ultra thin phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can file this in the category of "what's the point," but the iPhone Air was officially introduced, a phone that's just 5.6mm thin. Samsung beat Apple to the punch earlier this year when it released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is surprisingly a bit thicker than the iPhone at 5.8mm.</p><p>When you think about the R&D that had to go into redesigning every aspect of a phone so that it still provides a quality experience, it's pretty crazy. Apple redesigned its chassis from the ground up, along with relying on custom-designed components in order to wedge everything in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8" name="iphone-air-announcement-render" alt="Apple iPhone Air announcement render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the main components, such as both front and rear cameras, the speaker, and even the processor, were displaced, but are now all housed within the "plateau" on the back.

It's a move that Samsung is apparently also rumored to perform with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">Galaxy S26</a>.

But the one that immediately pops in my mind is Huawei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-versus-nexus-6">Nexus 6P</a> from all the way back in 2015.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN" name="Apple-iPhone-17-Pro-camera-close-up-250909" alt="Render of iPhone 17 Pro's "camera plateau"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it looked more like a periscope for a submarine, the 6P's camera bar still spread the width of the phone, with the glass being easily prone to cracking.</p><p>Part of the reason why some of us are fans of seeing Apple and Samsung adopt such a change is that it will hopefully put an end to the "table wobble." However, there are other benefits, such as providing more room for larger camera sensors while keeping the rest of the phone as thin as possible.</p><h2 id="tariff-proof-pricing-2">Tariff-proof pricing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5" name="iphone-17-lineup-pricing-breakdown" alt="Apple's iPhone lineup with pricing following iPhone 17 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably, the most surprising aspect of the iPhone 17 announcement wasn't the iPhone Air or even the new features coming to the AirPods Pro 3. It was that Apple didn't increase the price for any of the new models that are slated to arrive in a little over a week.</p><p>With the ongoing global tariff situation, many assumed Apple would pass some of those increased costs to the customer.

Unfortunately, it's not the kind of update you'd want to hear, as a new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 Ultra may take a step back with its 3x telephoto zoom camera.</p><p>Earlier reports indicated that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">switch to a new 12MP sensor</a> for the 3x telephoto zoom on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Many assumed this would mean crisper zoom and close-up shots. However, according to reliable tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1965598697519198438">Ice Universe</a>, Samsung will crop the 12MP down to just 10MP on the new sensor.</p><p>The leaker claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra will use only 10MP (of the 12MP available) with an f/2.4 aperture, a 1/3.94" sensor size, and 1.0μm pixels. While this may sound similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which also used a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor, it could result in a downgraded experience overall.</p><h2 id="smaller-pixels-may-hurt-low-light-performance-2">Smaller pixels may hurt low-light performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To break it down, the Galaxy S25 Ultra had a 1/3.53" 10MP sensor with 1.12μm pixel size. The Galaxy S26 Ultra may use a larger sensor, but with smaller 1.0μm pixels. For reference, the pixel size determines how much light is captured — the larger the number, the more light and typically the better the photos.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> scaling back to smaller pixels, the new sensor could let in less light than its predecessor, leading to weaker 3x shots in low-light conditions.</p><p>Of course, Samsung could offset this with software optimizations and an improved ISP, but based purely on hardware, it looks like we may be in for a slight downgrade on the next Ultra flagship.</p><p>Past rumors about the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest the phone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">keep the S Pen</a>, adopt a slimmer build, and support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">faster 60W charging</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_1362924355208326874&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-4792126853743754287%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fcell-phones%252F1105910%253Fpovid%253Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel%2Fway-to-get-pixel-10-with-physical-sim-in-us" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1187103296997437100-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-1015660682400264613&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1026776483449387902&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For now, the rumors are painting one new Galaxy Z Flip model next year with two new Fold devices. The publication claims Samsung is intending to create a "Wide" Fold model.</p><p>This Wide-Fold is reportedly aiming to combine dual 18:9 screens "to create an internal display with a nearly identical 18:18 aspect ratio." Perhaps we're looking at a future Fold that truly leans into the whole tablet vibe that welcomes users in with an inviting landscape view, rather than trying to balance things with verticality.</p><p>Info from its source claims Samsung is looking to finalize the details surrounding this phone by the end of September or early in October. Additionally, this second Wide-Fold is "expected to launch simultaneously" with 2026's expected Flip 8 and Fold 8.</p><h2 id="we-ve-had-two-folds-before-technically-2">We've had two Folds before... technically</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hearing the idea that we may have two Galaxy Z Folds on the way sort of reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>. You could say this device is a little bit of a wild card, as it was pretty much exclusive to the South Korean market. The foldable had a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8-inch internal display with a thinner, lighter build. The Special Edition didn't quite make headlines like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> did, as that model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">offered upgrades far beyond</a> the former.</p><p>That popularity is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">something Samsung is scrambling</a> to keep up with, as a recent report says the company needs to make more. The company is reportedly boosting its original production plans for the Fold 7 in September, going from 200,000 units to 260,000 units. This influx of popularity also forced Samsung to alter its plans in August, bumping things up by nearly 100,000 units to meet demand.</p><p>We're still very early in this alleged second Wide-Fold rumor. Samsung doesn't release foldables until the summer, anyway. We'll have to see how/if things change.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google states that its AI Quests will take students through a fantasy world, one that places them in the position of data researchers and fields such as medicine to solve problems with AI, and learn how that's applied.</p><p>AI Quests isn't extensive just yet; however, Google states the first quest will put students, ages 11 to 14, through Flood Forecasting research. These immersive, adventurous quests will show kids how AI can "help predict floods and give communities timely flood warnings."</p><p>These AI Quests are almost like a game, as they encourage kids to collect "relevant" data, evaluate that data, and test their theories (test the model). Google states this first quest is designed to teach students two important lessons: the importance of human judgment and how data quality can shape an AI's results. After the simulation is completed, Google says students will receive a video from the real researchers explaining their work.</p><p>There's also a set of activities to complete before and after the quest. AI Quests is available today (Sep 9) for educators and organizations in learning.</p><h2 id="google-sees-ai-in-the-classroom-2">Google sees AI in the classroom</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNGMGvk0vu8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Stanford Accelerator for Learning is integrating AI Quests into CRAFT as part of its partnership with Google Research. Victor R. Lee, faculty lead for AI and education at Stanford Accelerator for Learning, said, "Our partnership with Google Research is a powerful example of how academia and industry can come together."</p><p>AI Quests are expecting an update "in the coming months" that will add two more adventures for educators to give students. One quest will walk students through the journey of identifying diabetic retinopathy, a catalyst for blindness. The other is reportedly a quest to "map and understand" the human brain.</p><p>While so hard on AI, Google dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-empowers-google-classroom-educators-ai-focused-tools-notebooklm">Gemini-powered update for Classrooms</a>, bringing its selection of AI tools to teacher lesson plans and more. Educators were given access to NotebookLM, capable of creating enhanced study guides for kids. Gems also rolled out, so teachers could create an AI "expert" in a singular topic to further a child's learning for topics they may struggle with.</p><p>More than that, in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/college-students-get-google-ai-pro-plan-free-with-gemini-2-5-pro-announced">college students in the U.S.</a> and other regions were given Google's AI Pro plan for free.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the battery doesn't last as long as its immediate rivals, you still get up to a day with medium use. The cameras are quite good too, with Samsung making tweaks to its imaging algorithms. The software has plenty of useful features, and the device runs Android 16 out of the box. It may not have the latest tech, but it's still the most reliable choice if you're ready to switch to a foldable. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Much better design than previous years</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Powerful internals</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Amazing cameras</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Good software feature-set</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Android 16 out of the box</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Battery doesn't last as long</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Antiquated charging tech</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>OLED panels aren't as good as Magic V5</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Costlier than Magic V5</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_versus" data-id="d2d3d1c1-14c1-4e06-b086-bcfdeff347ad">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpWg7dXheG7rUSWjPJtuPN.jpg' alt="Honor Magic V5 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Honor Magic V5</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A decent alternative</strong></em></p><p>The Magic V5 has a bigger battery than the Fold 7, allowing it to last longer.

The update brings a few noteworthy improvements, per its changelog, that users will install once the update becomes available via the app on their phone. To begin, Meta's rolling out an update for the Oakley cameras. The patch notes state users should notice a much faster camera experience, enabling them to take photos and record videos quickly.</p><p>Joining this update is another that involves Meta's wake word prompt for capturing content with Oakley's cameras. The company states users can now say, "Hey Meta, restyle this." This voice prompt pushes your glasses to capture what you're looking at and pop a random "surprising style" on it. The notes say <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">Meta AI</a> cycles through a set number of styles when you utter this phrase—plus, you can save and share whatever it produces.</p><p>This is rolling out for English users in the U.S., Canada, India, Mexico, UAE, and Australia.</p><p>Voice searches have been expanded in this update. Now, English users outside of the U.S. can use voice commands for Audible. Other updates include the ability to connect your Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook to your Oakley Meta glasses to receive notifications about events and the ability to create new ones. To connect, Meta states users should head into the <strong>Meta AI app > Tap profile icon > App connections > connect Calendar</strong>.</p><h2 id="oakley-s-gonna-be-gonna-be-golden-2">Oakley's gonna be, gonna be golden</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rkRbPSixBvgR5Ru2q8uos8" name="oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-warm-white-prizm-lenses-03" alt="A pair of warm white limited edition Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with PRIZM lenses with running shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkRbPSixBvgR5Ru2q8uos8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final update concerns location reminders. Meta explains this as a feature that leans on your location services, if you've enabled them. When setting a reminder, your location will also be saved. The patch notes state users can go back and ask Meta AI about the place where they've created the reminder.</p><p>This update was spotted rolling out this morning (Sep 9), so more users should begin noticing it as the week progresses.</p><p>A month before the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses launched, we got our hands on the device to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">test the company's "battery upgrades</a>." While there's a lot of real-world data to get through, the short of it is that the Oakley glasses will last longer with the "Hey Meta" voice command disabled. You can still get to Meta AI by tapping/holding the side touchpad. More tests showed that these new lenses can capture roughly 60% more pictures and video than Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, and these "faster camera" updates today only make this more of a breeze to do.</p><p>Also, it seems we might've nailed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">Oakley Meta HSTN's superpower</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vinyl records nearly died out in favor of CDs, until they became nostalgic and actually outsold CDs in 2023 for the first time since 1987. Music listening often breaks common conventions of technological progress because, at the end of the day, listeners have simple wants and needs. Great sound, convenience, and immersion are just a few.</p><p>Those simple desires allow for older, obsolete formats and media to make a comeback. Over time, our definition of what is "convenient," for example, changes. Recently, casual listeners valued convenience in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">truly wireless earbuds</a> without a cord in sight. That's starting to shift, with wired earbuds now becoming hip and fashionable again, and the flurry of wired earbud announcements I saw at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a> proves it.</p><p>Sony announced a pair of wired USB-C earbuds during the event called the IER-EX15C USB-C, and I'll be testing those soon. But the more exciting announcement came from Belkin, which is taking advantage of the opportunity that comes with ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack for USB-C. Belkin's new SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds have a party trick we don't usually see in this category: active noise-canceling (ANC).</p><h2 id="what-makes-the-belkin-soundform-usb-c-wired-earbuds-unique-2">What makes the Belkin SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds unique</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ku8jYSiZu9MsnFdkWdKe2A" name="Belkin-USBC-earbuds-2" alt="The Belkin SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds with ANC at IFA." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku8jYSiZu9MsnFdkWdKe2A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wired earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii-best-iem-ive-used-yet">in-ear monitors (IEMs)</a> don't typically offer ANC, and that's because the 3.5mm headphone jack is only designed to transfer small amounts of power — usually the bare minimum needed to drive earbuds, headphones, and microphones. The microchips and processing needed to take in sound data from onboard microphones and counter them with ANC require more power than a 3.5mm jack can typically provide.</p><p>That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">ANC-powered headphones</a> and earbuds are often battery-powered, even in wired mode. The built-in battery helps power those extra features. When we lost the 3.5mm jack on phones, tablets, and other devices, it was seen as a downgrade. In many ways, that's true, but the USB-C port also presents a fantastic opportunity for audio listening.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C port</a> is the most versatile we've ever seen, capable of delivering power and data in large volumes at the same time. That's what makes a product like the Belkin SoundForm USB-C possible — the earbuds can siphon power from your phone or other device over the USB-C cable, while transferring audio and powering the ANC features within.</p><p>By offering ANC in a cheap pair of earbuds with a flat, wired USB-C cable, Belkin already has something special here. Combined with the 12mm drivers and a few EQ presets, you get features once exclusive to higher-priced wireless earbuds in a $35 wired package. It's great for buyers on a budget or for people who just want the convenience of using a cable.</p><h2 id="why-we-need-wired-earbuds-to-get-good-again-2">Why we need wired earbuds to get good again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ" name="iem-hero-1.jpg" alt="IEM hero shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wireless and wired earbuds each have their own ideal set of use cases, but contrary to popular belief, one form factor can't rule them all. Wired earbuds particularly excel if you want to avoid losses in audio quality due to Bluetooth. Granted, a pair of $35 earbuds with smaller drivers probably won't make the most of lossless audio quality — but neither will premium wireless earbuds in a lossy Bluetooth codec.</p><p>I also love using wired earbuds in situations where I can't risk a truly wireless earbud falling out of my ears. One specific circumstance is while traveling, when an earbud slips out of my ear on a plane or while running through a new city, it is a worst-case scenario. Plus, the affordable price of entry means I can use them without worrying about a high replacement cost if they get lost or broken.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.belkin.com/pr-belkin-ifa-2025.html" target="_blank">Belkin SoundForm USB-C</a>, you get all the convenience benefits of wired audio without losing IPX5 water-resistance or ANC support, which were previously key drawbacks. Of course, you still run into the issue of charging or using other accessories while using USB-C headphones, which is why you'll probably need wireless headphones in certain instances.</p><p>These earbuds debut next month, and I think they'll usher in a new wave of modern wired audio products that we desperately need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Many S Pen fans have been fearing the worst for the past few months, and for good reason.</p><p>Samsung has been making some moves that the S Pen fans, even though in the minority, have been caught off guard. First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor">it removed Bluetooth S Pen features on the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and more recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">ditched the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, </a>as the Korean OEM wanted to keep things sleek and compact on the phone, which has caused us to think about the future of the S Pen itself.</p><p>While the company continues to make phones lighter and sleeker, we feel that the stylus could be a thing of the past. However, this may not be the case for the next-gen Galaxy S26 Ultra, a new leak from prominent tipster, Ice Universe, hints that the device will indeed keep the S Pen, with alleged device renders showing a dedicated slot for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP" name="Galaxy-s26-Ultra-leaked-Spen-slot" alt="S Pen support on Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe/ X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't completely abandoning the S Pen across its device ecosystem.

The company launched a new S Pen showcasing a hexagonal form factor that was engineered to look and feel like a traditional pencil. So, the company won't really stop making these styluses, which implies its support for future Galaxy phones (Phew!).</p><p>In another post earlier today, Ice Universe shared some details about the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera, which may feature a new main camera and a larger telephoto lens, with a wider aperture, potentially resulting in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-leak-suggests-sharper-brighter-low-light-photos">improved low-light images</a>. Additionally, the tipster notes that the camera bump on the Galaxy S26 Ultra will be thicker than that of the S25 Ultra, increasing from 2.4mm to 4.5mm.  Despite the thicker camera bump, the telephoto sensor might still be surprisingly small for a flagship phone, which is a bummer, they add.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera bump reaches 4.5mm (compared to 2.4mm on the S25 Ultra), driven by the large-aperture main camera and telephoto lens.

Configurations could go up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p><p>The rear camera array might include four cameras: a 200MP main, a 50MP periscope with a wider aperture than the S25 Ultra, a 50MP ultrawide, and an upgraded 12MP short-range telephoto. The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra could be sticking to its predecessor's 5,000mAh battery, but could see faster 60W charging speeds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The S25 Ultra also features a more slim and rounded design than its predecessor, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset continues to impress as one of the best processors on the market. </p><p>You also get to enjoy all of the latest AI-boosted software features from Galaxy AI and Gemini, and like the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup, the Ultra guarantees seven years of OS and security upgrades. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-lockscreen-widgets-neon" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a widget-covered lockscreen on a rainy neon-soaked street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMGmZoK3rZwMt7WQ59uTKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, with the arrival of the iPhone 17 Pro Max, the S25 Ultra has its work cut out for it.

Shortly after, the company posted another teaser on X/Twitter saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-sets-date-for-gemini-on-google-home">Gemini is coming to Google Home</a> on October 1, while also teasing the new Nest Cam.

Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nest/comments/1nby3dl/new_2k_doorbell/">one2zerojigawat</a> reportedly got their hands on the smart doorbell nearly three weeks ahead of launch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-nest-doorbell-2k-retail-box-leak-3596030/">Android Authority</a>).</p><h2 id="google-nest-doorbell-2k-spotted-on-shelves-2">Google Nest Doorbell 2K spotted on shelves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXhsxqrgvxxKc3ApCwuFLX" name="Google-Nest-Doorbell-2k-retail-leak" alt="Retail box of the leaked Google Nest Doorbell 2K" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXhsxqrgvxxKc3ApCwuFLX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with other recent Google products, the Nest Doorbell 2K will ship in minimal packaging. The box confirms the official name as "Nest Doorbell 2K" rather than Nest Doorbell 3rd gen. It also shows whether the doorbell is wired or wireless, along with prominent Gemini branding.</p><p>On the back, the packaging reveals specs like 2K resolution, HDR video, 166-degree FoV, night vision, two-way audio, and weather resistance. Inside the box, you'll find the doorbell, chime, base plate, a 20-degree wedge, wire connector, and screws/anchors.</p><p>The most interesting part of the packaging, though, is a label at the bottom: "Subscription (sold separately) required for certain features, including Gemini and some AI experiences." The exact features we can expect from the new doorbell aren't listed, but it's likely tied to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-aware-vs-ring-protect">Nest Aware</a> being rebranded as Google Home Premium, alongside a pricier tier called Google Home Premium Advanced.</p><p>We still don't know the pricing or availability of the new Nest Doorbell 2K, but with Google set to share updates on Gemini and smart home on October 1, all of the news surrounding Google's new smart home products should be official in just a few days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">TCL's NXTPAPER technology</a>, a custom type of LCD that includes multiple comfort layers and custom tuning, including a matte anti-glare layer and black levels previously thought unachievable for the tech.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025">TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra</a> is the first smartphone equipped with the latest version of NXTPAPER, and it just might be my favorite smartphone display of all time. As someone who regularly seeks out alternative types of displays with better comfort ratings, NXTPAPER greatly appeals to me. Now, with NXTPAPER 4.0, I'm finally seeing the fruits of TCL's labor and can fully recommend it as a legit alternative to OLED. Here are all the details.</p><h2 id="comfort-above-all-2">Comfort above all</h2><p>As I said in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra display review</a>, <em>all</em> modern flagship phone displays look good. Any rating assigned to one over the other is generally nitpicking between characteristics that the average person simply doesn't see or care about.</p><p>That's why comfort is the new benchmark of display quality. A high comfort rating ensures <strong>all</strong> users can see and enjoy content on a display, no matter if they're looking at it for 5 minutes or 5 hours.</p><p>In the modern digital age, where a smartphone is practically essential for everyday life, it's becoming increasingly more important for companies to make devices that work for everyone, including those of us with visual disabilities or limitations.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reflectivity-and-brightness"><span>Reflectivity and brightness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uXacQzsauB5RC25U2AgwdG" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing outdoor visibility in direct sunlight between the Bigme HiBreak Pro, TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uXacQzsauB5RC25U2AgwdG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3400" height="1912" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An up-and-coming trend in smartphone displays is glare reduction. All NXTPAPER devices feature a matte anti-reflective layer, but NXTPAPER 4.0 features a redesigned substrate and nano-matrix lithography application to enhance brightness and color accuracy.</p><p>This updated anti-glare layer is incredibly effective, reducing reflections so much that the display looks almost identical to full-color paper printing. It's actually wild looking at the screen throughout the day and seeing such a gorgeous, flat-lit display that doesn't force me to squint or strain to see.</p><p>The effect is best in any indoor condition or when outside in partial shade. Inside, the anti-glare layer is perfect for reducing those annoying reflections from adjacent lights or any brightly lit object. In this environment, zero reflection of any kind is visible, and it makes the phone a joy to use versus any other display technology I've used to date.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5909px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="itksEPRygAZG5MYkRZKk5o" name="nxtpaper-vs-oled-vs-e-ink-sunlight" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility between a TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a Bigme HiBreak Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itksEPRygAZG5MYkRZKk5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5909" height="3324" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about NXTPAPER 4.0 is its ability to create a superb picture without following normal display expectations. Take sunlight viewability, for example. At 850 nits, you'd expect this to be difficult to see in the sunlight. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> hits 3300 nits to ensure it's nice and bright, for instance, but you'll quickly learn that the problem wasn't brightness all along. It was glare.</p><p>Outdoor visibility comes with an interesting caveat, though. It's super easy to see in direct sunlight, but only if the sun isn't directly reflecting off the matte surface. I'm writing this at 3 pm, sitting in my car while I wait to pick my son up from school, and it's incredibly easy to see. It's also excellent for dashboard navigation. But if I were trying to type this up on my back deck with the sun overhead, I'd have to hold it at an angle.</p><p>That angle is the only really weird thing about this display, as the matte layer will completely occlude the display if the sun is shining straight into your vision. It's not a huge deal since you only have to <em>slightly</em> adjust the angle — you would never keep the sun directly on any other display, either — but it does look different from a normal reflective display. I would recommend using the scheduled light/dark theme option to keep light mode on during the day if you spend a lot of time outside, as that also makes a huge difference for visibility.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVOPiZ1yTJI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Elsewhere, the brightness level is simply brilliant and always feels comfortable. It can even get down to 2 nits when extra dim display is enabled, something that was a problem with previous generations of NXTPAPER. I've always found these displays to be too bright to read in bed at night, but the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra fixes all that.</p><p>The best part is that it achieves this with <strong>zero</strong> flicker, unlike OLED. That's because OLED normally has to switch to PWM dimming when you get to lower dimming levels, creating an uncomfortable flicker that can cause headaches and eye pain. Not something you want right before bed.</p><p>This phone is completely flicker-free and never uses PWM dimming at any time. It's true voltage-adjusted DC dimming, and it's one of the strengths of this display tech.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-settings"><span>Eye comfort settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7q2XWUQDkjUcrcfkNt5KYh" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-layer-stack-render" alt="TCL NXTPAPER technology screen layer visual." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7q2XWUQDkjUcrcfkNt5KYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>NXTPAPER 4.0 features a built-in blue light filter that performs exceptionally well. Additionally, the phone features two automated modes that adjust the display's color temperature to match the time of day or automatically based on ambient light temperature. You can enable both modes at the same time, if you like.</p><p>Since the screen doesn't use PWM dimming, there's no need to have any kind of flicker reduction option. By default, however, the phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to adjust display colors and to create more accurate grey colors. Turning off all three options under NXTVISION display settings reduces the amount of dithering system-wide.</p><p>Sticking to normal and black & white ink modes ensures the least amount of dithering, and using sRGB or Natural color space options seems to disable dithering entirely when NXTVISION is disabled. The phone's Color Paper display mode seems to dither no matter what options are selected.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AfD3BFUTjoiaC6GEF3PYcQ" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-matte-screen" alt="A light prism reflecting off the matte layer on the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfD3BFUTjoiaC6GEF3PYcQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TCL features a notable number of additional eye care features found under the NXTPAPER zone menu. An automated alert can be enabled that will tell you to take a break after a set amount of screen time to help you stave off digital addiction.</p><p>A number of posture alerts can also help you correct problems with normal device use. Staring at the screen too closely can generate a posture alert, and the same will happen if you lie down and read with the phone for too long.</p><p>You can also enable alerts for when you're using the phone in an environment that's too shaky — on a train or somewhere else that could cause eye-strain while reading — or when you're in environments that are too bright or too dark to look at the screen for a long time. All of these options can be enabled if you like, and are disabled by default.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-colors-and-ink-modes"><span>Colors and ink modes</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="43HkE5Mk9gNwqRWpUUzD78" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-color-options" alt="Comparing the normal, color paper, and ink paper display modes on the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43HkE5Mk9gNwqRWpUUzD78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most unique parts of NXTPAPER technology is the ability to switch between full color, "color paper," and black & white "ink" modes with the switch on the right side of the phone. Switching takes a few seconds and is accompanied by a beautiful animation to show the progress.</p><p>NXTPAPER devices have always had these three options, so they're no different visually from those. Normal mode is what you expect: a full-color experience that looks like a modern smartphone display. Color Paper makes all the whites a warm, off-white color and changes most colors to pastel. Ink Paper makes everything black and white.</p><p>A fourth mode, Max Ink mode, uses the black & white visual appearance of Ink Paper mode but closes all apps except for the ones you whitelist. The idea here is to not only save battery life but also to act as a "digital detox" mode for when you need downtime or want to be less distracted.</p><p>As with the "reading modes" or "e-book modes" on some phones, these modes just alter the color of the display. They don't adjust the backlight itself or change the nature of the display itself, so they're not quite the same as using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">an E Ink phone</a> for eye care.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motion-resolution-viewing-angles"><span>Motion, resolution, viewing angles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S6vy3GeKTXRNfuXy6d6paQ" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-black-levels" alt="A look at the black levels of the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra using dark mode in Discord" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S6vy3GeKTXRNfuXy6d6paQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra's display automatically swaps between 120Hz and 60Hz, but you can select to keep it at 60Hz for battery or eye comfort reasons. At 7.2 inches, this massive display looks a little soft with 2340 x 1080 resolution.</p><p>I don't think the display looks traditionally low-resolution, which normally infers that you can see the individual pixels or that edges of icons and text have a stair-stepping pattern to them. Everything here is clean and clear, it's just softer than you might expect because of the additional light scattering and matte filters above the panel.</p><p>Lastly, we'll take a look at some of the traditionally weakest points of LCDs: motion blur, viewing angles, and black levels. Viewing angles and black levels are downright spectacular and are the best I've ever seen on an IPS-based display. Most of the time, I can't tell the difference between the black levels on this display and an OLED, although OLED continues to have better overall contrast.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CBqWFNmirqP7eSy6Tbxh4S" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-viewing-angles" alt="Comparing viewing angles with a bright wallpaper on the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CBqWFNmirqP7eSy6Tbxh4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When using the phone to scroll in dark mode or in low light, you'll be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and a high-quality OLED panel. Most OLEDs tend to "bleed purple" when you slowly scroll in low light or in dark mode, and that effect is equivalent to the slight motion blur you'll see from the slower-refreshing pixels of NXTPAPER's IPS base.</p><p>That difference becomes more readily apparent when using light mode or when the backlight is turned up brighter, especially when scrolling with black text on a light background. This effect is less apparent in videos or while gaming.</p><p>In short, motion resolution is worse than OLED but better than a traditional IPS display. I can easily read words as I scroll, even if I flick the screen quickly, so I would still rate this as "good" even if it's not the best.</p><h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict</h2><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra has one of the most incredible displays I've ever used on a smartphone. It's fully flicker-free and offers relief for both people sensitive to PWM dimming and dithering, something that's simply unheard of in 2025 when phones either use some form of dithering or PWM-style dimming, which both introduce flicker to the experience.</p><p>NXTPAPER 4.0 also breaks from expectations of LCDs, offering superb black levels and viewing angles, excellent color reproduction, and tons of eye care modes. Outdoor visibility is still the weakest point of the experience, but it is significantly better than any previous NXTPAPER display by a wide margin. It's not hard to see in sunlight, but it's not as easy as E Ink or some OLED displays.</p><p>The overall appearance of the display is incredibly captivating thanks to a combination of several bespoke visual filters and a matte surface, giving it a unique look and feel. Readability is much better on this display than most, and I found myself entranced by the display over the past week. It's gorgeous to look at, and ushers in a new era for IPS displays and TCL as a new quality contender.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="54d20a26-b090-4559-bd2e-ce372247d2a0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrtZBDCaBLATEkpdKWLXBJ.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra black colorway"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With eye comfort at its core, the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra is the best choice for anyone concerned about eye health without sacrificing visual quality.

This much-requested feature is now live across Android, iOS, and the web.</p><p>The update supports MP3, M4A, and WAV files. Once you upload, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will transcribe the audio, pull out the key points, and give you a clear summary (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/gemini-audio-upload/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This feature can be accessed via the plus menu on Gemini’s mobile app or “Upload files” on the web. Once you upload an audio clip, the app analyzes it, turning meetings, interviews, lectures, or voice notes into easy-to-digest summaries and key takeaways.</p><h2 id="top-user-request-comes-to-life-2">Top user request comes to life</h2><p>Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1965057589718499756?s=19" target="_blank">shared on X</a> that this has been the feature users have asked for the most.</p><p>However, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14903178" target="_blank">support page</a>, you can upload up to 10 audio files at once, but their combined length can’t exceed 10 minutes. Other Gemini usage limits still apply, so keep that in mind before sending a batch of files.</p><p>The audio upload limits aren’t infinite but are fairly generous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-likely-to-get-video-analysis-feature-via-google-search-app">compared to video</a>. Free users get 10 minutes for audio, which is double the five-minute video cap. Meanwhile, paid users get three times the one-hour video limit.</p><p>Another limit to keep in mind is the file count. You can upload up to 10 files per prompt, and this covers everything from code folders with up to 5,000 files to GitHub repos and ZIPs with up to 10 compressed files. The new audio feature counts toward this 10-file total, so it doesn’t expand the overall limit.</p><p>Beyond transcription, Gemini can highlight key points, distinguish speakers, and pull out action items or quotes. This, in turn, makes any audio file a neatly structured, searchable document.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company introduced many new features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, Magic Cue, and more, but one of the most interesting additions was the Daily Hub.

It works like a hub where users can see their daily events, weather information, reminders, and even things like bills from Gmail. For some users, the Daily Hub even pulled up some relevant notes from Google Keep.</p><p>In addition to this, Google also includes media recommendations from apps you've opted into (with information pulled from Google TV), as well as suggestions from YouTube and YouTube Music. The Daily Hub essentially acts like a digital newspaper that updates in real time and surfaces content relevant to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, while promising in theory, the feature has been hit or miss.

That’s a jump from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>’s f/3.4, meaning it should capture more light and handle low-light shots better.</p><p>Ice Universe also states the S26 Ultra's 200MP main sensor will get a wider aperture, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-could-make-taking-night-shots-a-lot-more-effortless">reiterating a previous statement</a>.

This combination is key to sharper, clearer images with less motion blur, whether you're shooting at night or in a dim room.</p><p>As per the new rumor, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s main camera could soak up 47% more light than the S25 Ultra, while its 5x telephoto lens might pull in 38% more.</p><p>Meanwhile, the aging 10MP sensor on the 3x telephoto lens is set to be swapped for a 12MP unit. The new Samsung S5K3LD sensor should pack around 20% more pixels than the S25 Ultra’s version.</p><p>Additionally, a wider aperture also gives a shallower depth of field, letting portraits show off smoother, more natural bokeh.

This can include security enhancements, new features via Pixel Drops, OS upgrades, bug fixes, and more. The Watch 4 will officially be supported till at least October 2028.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-pixel-watch-4-is-smarter-slicker-and-more-powerful-2">The Pixel Watch 4 is smarter, slicker, and more powerful</h2><p>It's clear that Google wasn't aiming for any major redesign of any of its new launches since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a> looks nearly identical to the Watch 3. The bezels around the display are slimmer, which makes the screen look larger, and the slightly domed display pushes even closer against the outer glass, making the UI feel better to interact with. Wear OS 6 looks vibrant and fresh, and the new Material 3 Expressive design makes interactions fun.</p><p>The power bump is welcomed on the Pixel Watch 4 thanks to the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 SoC. You get on-device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> capabilities like smart replies to messages and a Raise-to-Talk feature. The Watch 4 is also the first commercially available smartwatch to have satellite SOS connectivity. The faster charging and significant battery boost are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/should-you-buy-the-google-pixel-watch-4">big reasons to upgrade</a> to the Pixel Watch 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U" name="Pixel-Watch-4-charging" alt="Pixel Watch on the side mounted charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, in Matte Black or Polished Silver. You can also get the 41mm variant in Champagne Gold and the 45mm in Satin Moonstone. Prices start at $349 or $449 for the Wi-Fi and LTE versions, respectively. The 45mm variant gets a $50 bump in price for the individual variants. If you've been holding off on upgrading your Pixel Watch 2, now would be a good time to trade it in for the Watch 4. It's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> to buy in 2025, and a great companion for your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ac4ab0b-8126-448d-abbe-166125a85d72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEompPFnaagkMfe5Jj2GmG.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Smarter time keeper</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is one of the most powerful Wear OS smartwatches available, thanks to a new chipset, on-device AI features, satellite SOS, and more.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It notes that Google has changed its old AI Mode (google.com/aimode) to a much simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=50&aep=11">google.com/ai</a> URL. There's nothing else different with this change. The main takeaway is the "shortcut" to get there has changed, presumably to help people remember and get there faster, as you're not forced to remember the name of the feature—just AI.</p><p>The publication speculates that this change could signal more to come from Google, as its URL is shortened simply to AI.</p><p>It makes sense; if Google has created a much broader AI link, which, for now, takes users to Search's AI Mode, more of its software could end up here as new tabs or overhead links. Elsewhere, the publication discovered that Google has shifted its AI Mode icon within its main app on Android and iOS.</p><p>Now, users won't find the colorful icon <em>in </em>the search box. Instead, it's placed beneath it, alongside the voice query button and the Lens icon. It's unclear why Google changed this, as the colorful AI Mode icon is still within the search box in new Chrome tabs on Android.</p><h2 id="opening-the-doors-for-more-ai-2">Opening the doors for more AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC" name="ai-mode-google-search-io2025" alt="AI Mode at I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1580" height="889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI Mode has had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">pretty productive year so far</a>, in terms of bringing new features to users interested in the software. During I/O, Google announced the "Deep Search" feature for AI Mode, which users should now see more frequently whenever AI Overviews appear during a query. The purpose of this is to allow the AI to give you a more "in-depth" response about a topic, helping you to understand those nitty-gritty details.</p><p>It's a feature that enables the AI to scour multiple websites and do all the heavy research for you, before delivering a "comprehensive" overview of everything to your benefit. At I/O, Google said AI Mode's Deep Search goes through "hundreds of websites" and uses its ability to draw conclusions and more to help you with harder topics and things you want to learn more about.</p><p>In July, Google updated AI Mode again, but that came with the ability for it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">to place phone calls for you</a>.

There's a chance the buds could play nice with its recent AI suite on its flagship Nothing Phone 3. Perhaps users can record voice notes using their buds and interact with their handheld even more just by touching the buds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update carries AYI1 at the end of its version number for September, bringing the current month's security fixes, but also two new features for pre-existing One UI 8 elements. As Vats notes, Samsung is bringing an update to its Now Bar that lets users view finance information from their lock screen.</p><p>The changelog states, "Check stock prices without unlocking. If there's a significant price change in a stock you've added to your watchlist in Google Finance, it will appear in the Now bar at the end of the trading day."</p><p>Additionally, the publication discovered the rest of the Korean patch notes, which hold another update for Samsung DeX. The September patch lets users "add widgets to the home screen in the Samsung DeX mode." The notes mention that users can add widgets like a calendar, clock, or "decorative" images. A user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1965030576962093374">X also spotted the change</a>, showcasing what it will look like once users receive it.</p><p>On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Samsung's security side</a>, both foldables are receiving a heavy dose of "High" level security fixes, as well as two critical software fixes. The critical fixes are something Google mentions in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-09-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> for September. One of the fixes for CVE-2025-48539 regards an Android System fix. The other, CVE-2025-27034, is a critical fix for a Qualcomm closed-source component vulnerability.</p><h2 id="foldables-in-the-news-2">Foldables in the news</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Vats states on X, this update is rolling out for users in South Korea as of today (Sep 8). Typically, updates like this begin on home soil for Samsung's devices before rolling out to other regions. We should slowly begin to notice this patch hit devices in more regions as the week progresses (and hopefully the U.S. by the end of the week).</p><p>Moreover, the user on X who spotted the DeX widgets states this feature is expected to hit other devices, like the Galaxy S25 series, and "older" models once Samsung drops the update.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> made some headlines last week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">due to its popularity</a> and how Samsung is scrambling because of it. It's been reported that Samsung is changing up its production plans for the Fold 7 in September, looking to produce 260,000 new units, instead of 200,000 like it originally planned. We can't say we're surprised, as reports from South Korea showed that the Fold 7 was incredibly popular during its pre-order phase, beating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The Flip model, in the past, was typically the one people leaned toward. However, this year, the Fold 7 took up 60% of the pre-orders.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While both phones are rectangular with curved corners, they feel entirely different in the hand.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL keeps a design similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> with flat edges and a pill-shaped visor running across the back, housing all the camera sensors and the temperature sensor. There's also the now slightly larger (and more prominent) "G" logo centered on the rear.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 has a different design with a circular camera module at the top left. It also has curved corners, but unlike the Pixel, it comes with a curved display and curved back edges that melt into the frame, making it easier to hold.</p><p>Both phones have similar screen sizes and dimensions. The OnePlus 13 sports a 6.82-inch display and measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5–8.9 mm. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a slightly smaller 6.8-inch panel but with comparable dimensions of 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="54x2xzyPbEUy3MXqSeYCum" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/54x2xzyPbEUy3MXqSeYCum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you do feel in your hand, though, is the weight. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is heavier than before at 232 grams, while the OnePlus 13 (despite keeping a larger battery, more on that later) comes in lighter at 210 grams.</p><p>Although the Pixel 10 Pro XL is a bit heavier, Google offsets this with a feature no other flagship Android maker offers right now: built-in magnets for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">MagSafe-like Qi2 wireless charging</a>. This means you won't need third-party cases or stickers to attach the Pixel 10 Pro XL to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> like wallets, power banks, mounts, and chargers, as the phone supports all these accessories natively.</p><p>In fact, the Pixel 10 Pro XL also supports the highest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2 standard</a>, allowing fast 25W wireless charging.

Starting with the former, you get a physical SIM card slot on the OnePlus 13, so you can just push your SIM in and start using the device. On the Pixel 10 Pro XL in the U.S., you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">only get an eSIM option</a>.</p><p>In terms of durability, technically, the OnePlus 13 is more durable than the Pixel 10 Pro XL thanks to its dual IP68 + IP69 rating, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL only carries IP68 dust and water resistance. Both phones can handle occasional rain and even short underwater video capture, but the OnePlus is also rated against high-pressure, high-temperature water jet sprays. You may never need it, but it's reassuring to know your phone can survive those conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yWqoRgJkkvcVhuRzagUPE7" name="oneplus-13-display-home-screen-01" alt="The beautiful, eye-friendly display on the OnePlus 13 showing the home screen with a vibrant wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWqoRgJkkvcVhuRzagUPE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the front, both phones pack large 6.8-inch AMOLED panels.

This includes periodic Pixel Drops and Android feature drops. The phone will continue to get updates until 2032.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-is-google-s-finest-foldable-yet-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google's finest foldable yet</h2><p>Just like the rest of the Pixel 10 series, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> might not look too different on the outside, but it has some pretty significant upgrades on the inside. One of the biggest in my book is the IP68 rating for dust and waterproofing. No other foldable has managed to achieve this level of rating yet, making the 10 Pro Fold the first to do it. The best we've had so far is an IP48 rating, which debuted with Samsung's foldables in 2024.</p><p>The other big change is the Tensor G5 chip, which unlocks more advanced on-device AI capabilities and performance. The latter is still not quite up to par with the competition, as we found out in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10 review</a>. The addition of magnets underneath the back panel of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold makes it the first foldable to natively support Qi2 wireless charging. Google calls this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, but it's essentially a way to use any MagSafe accessories directly with the 10 Pro Fold, without a case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is currently one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around. It comes in Moonstone and Jade trims, and you can pre-order it now, with open sales starting from October 9, 2025. The Fold still offers a physical SIM slot, unlike the rest of the series that have done away with it. Prices start at $1,799 for the base 16GB/256GB configuration, and the storage goes up to 1TB.</p><p>One impressive fact about the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that Google claims it can "handle over 10 years of folding." Google is confident about its new gearless hinge and the other durability improvements made to the folding display. The phone also has a sizeable battery which should easily let it last for more than a day on one charge. We'll be putting the 10 Pro Fold through our rigorous review process and will have the final verdict on whether it's worth it or not very soon.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ac4ab0b-8126-448d-abbe-166125a85d72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Folding like a champ</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the latest flagship from Google, sporting improved durability, an IP68 rating, Pixelsnap charging, and a more powerful Tensor chip than ever before.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

We've also seen companies like Apple, Samsung, and Strava add AI coaching options for their products.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai" target="_blank">AI software</a> in the fitness space is only one piece of the puzzle. Hardware companies are also developing new wearable concepts with AI at the core. To get an idea of where we're at and where we're headed, I tested Samsung's Running Coach software and Hypershell's X Ultra exoskeleton hardware at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2025</a> in Berlin, Germany.</p><p>As an amateur distance runner, I wanted to find out if adding AI to my training could really help. Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="personal-trainers-aren-t-going-anywhere-yet-2">Personal trainers aren't going anywhere... yet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-2" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung debuted Running Coach alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">wearables expert Michael Hicks put it through its paces</a>. His experience was less-than-stellar, as Running Coach underestimated his abilities. That got me wondering whether a more amateur runner like myself would be a better fit for the software.</p><p>At Samsung's mobile devices booth at IFA 2025, I filled out a quick survey about my sleep and running habits, and was then given a slip with my running level and a QR code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6" name="Samsung-Running-Sleep-Test" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, I still ran into Running Coach limitations. The feature is built around fixed goals that are linked to your running level — I got Level 5 after the quick survey at IFA — with little room for personalization.</p><p>I think this strategy is a mistake, because it makes Running Coach too centered upon the goal of finishing a race length you may not be interested in. Additionally, when you reach a goal, you simply move to the next level without much focus on being able to complete those distances during training on a week-to-week basis.</p><p>For instance, the Level 5 training plan has me trying to finish a 10K under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile) — something I can already do. I can't tell Running Coach that I'm trying to cut my 5K time rather than build up to longer distances, or that I'd rather gain the strength to run five times per week before scaling distances. This seems like something that would be easy enough for Samsung to add with a few extra survey questions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-1" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll skip using Running Coach for my own training plan for now, but using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> on the Galaxy Watch 8 has actually been a big help.

The $2,000 exoskeleton utilizes AI and machine learning to anticipate your next move and provide motorized assistance accordingly. It uses data from more than 12 sensors and its AI MotionEngine Ultra, built on training data, to adjust to your individual stride signature. No one walks the same way, and that's why AI and ML are necessary.</p><p>The device connects to an Android app and is designed for physical activities, like walking, hiking, and running.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT" name="Hypershell-X-Plus-App" alt="The Hypershell X Plus app running on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's something you really need to <em>feel</em> to believe, but the motorized exoskeleton actually does help lift your leg up in alignment with your stride to reduce exertion.

However, I <em>do</em> see runners potentially using exoskeletons for training.

It can also reduce impact stress while going downhill, possibly lessening knee and joint pain.</p><p>It might sound like torture, but advanced runners already do this with devices like speed parachutes.

I'd never use it in a race, but I do think it can help you become a better runner.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Hypershell provided travel and lodging for part of my trip to IFA, but had no input in this article. </em></p> ]]></dc:content>

This lineup has been around for a few years, with pricing usually hovering between $300 and $400. This model in particular, retails for $329, but you can now save $180 from Best Buy.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="HP Chromebook 14-inch (14a-ne1013dx): $329" data-dimension48="HP Chromebook 14-inch (14a-ne1013dx): $329" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hp-14-chromebook-intel-celeron-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-modern-grey/JJGQJQJK9P" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7sBdxCvSPS5wWKzPGcEWxH" name="hp-chromebook-14-inch-14a-ne1013dx-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sBdxCvSPS5wWKzPGcEWxH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>HP Chromebook 14-inch (14a-ne1013dx): </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-11-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/J3ZYG26H99" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="HP Chromebook 14-inch (14a-ne1013dx): $329" data-dimension48="HP Chromebook 14-inch (14a-ne1013dx): $329" data-dimension25=""><del>$329</del> <strong>$149 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The Chromebook 14-inch might be the best option if you need a "family laptop," or something just to browse the web, check emails, and watch some YouTube or a movie.

Over the years, I've also been fortunate enough to spend some time with HP's less-expensive options and still manage to come away impressed, most of the time.</p><p>The Chromebook 14a is one of those devices that I would recommend to most people looking for a basic computing device. It just provides a solid experience, won't empty your wallet, and has a battery that will last for days.</p><p>Sure, there might be more enticing Chromebooks out there, but there are also so many less-than-stellar options that it's nice having a line that you can trust. And that's kind of where HP falls for some, as it very rarely goes for the catchy headlines or gimmicky features, and instead, just provides a fantastic overall experience.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's because, according to Sien Chang, product manager for Pixel Display, Google believes that most of its users are looking for a display that tops the charts for brightness and color accuracy.</p><p>It's a goal I surmised was at the root of the problems I started experiencing three years ago, after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a> was released. After months of increasingly painful headaches and eye pain, I learned the display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">was the root of the problem</a>.</p><p>Since then, I've learned a lot about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a> and spoken with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">companies like OnePlus</a> and Honor who are working towards making ultrabright modern displays more comfortable for people who are, effectively, allergic to them. It's a goal I had hoped Google would also adopt when the company launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting" target="_blank">new 'sensitive eyes'</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting"> feature</a> on the Pixel 10 Pro series, but it turns out the new feature simply doesn't do enough.</p><h2 id="still-stuck-in-the-mud-2">Still stuck in the mud</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LH7hNMzQZVe5siPT3E34FM" name="PWM-explainer" alt="Viewing default dimming rates using a 1/6400 shutter speed of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Honor 400 Pro, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LH7hNMzQZVe5siPT3E34FM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not long ago, Samsung debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">a new 480Hz PWM rate</a> on its phones, slightly exceeding that of the iPhone. This was followed by companies like OnePlus, Honor, Nothing, Xiaomi, and others that have launched phones with PWM rates in the thousands of hertz or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025" target="_blank">eliminated</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025"> PWM dimming altogether</a>.</p><p>So imagine my surprise when the Pixel 10 Pro launched with a feature that would "adjust the dimming rate for sensitive eyes" like mine. I hoped that Google would join the ranks of the aforementioned companies and show Samsung and Apple a new way forward for display excellence, but my hope was misplaced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WavtphM5v4m2shnJHQcvWL" name="google-pixel-10-pro-sensitive-eyes-accessibility-feature" alt="Testing out the new sensitive eyes dimming feature on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WavtphM5v4m2shnJHQcvWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I asked Google's display team why the company used 240Hz dimming for so long, only to settle on 480Hz for this new accessibility feature. After all, this is just catching up to the competition, not getting ahead. The response was, unfortunately, exactly what I expected.</p><p>"We always aim to deliver the best overall display experience of our users," Chang told me. "To us, this means delivering the best image quality that is comfortable to view in any condition. The EM (PWM) frequency, along with other specs, are driven by this comprehensive goal and therefore is not determined by any single factor."</p><p>Essentially, this means that Google's reason for choosing any specific display spec was entirely reliant on its goal of achieving "display excellence," as the company refers to it. In a way, it's similar to what we saw happen on the Nothing Phone 3 when the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-confirms-phone-3-pwm-rate-priortizes-picture-quality">lowered its PWM rate after launch</a> to "prioritize screen quality."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DZJGVmVcRmmnVdXv4PBZCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-0205" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZJGVmVcRmmnVdXv4PBZCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I respect the desire to top the charts and differentiate your product from a benchmark-worthy perspective, it doesn't make sense here. Google regularly discourages the use of benchmarks when assessing its Tensor processor performance. Why does the company care so much about display benchmarks? Shouldn't it focus on something that's better for the overall user experience?</p><p>Additionally, developing an accessibility setting should be based <em>on the disability</em> rather than following the same logic that led to Google's displays to this point. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">Several studies</a> on flicker show that Google should use <em>at least 3000Hz</em> PWM dimming based on brightness level and modulation rate. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/">the IEEE standards for flicker</a>, established back in 2008, prove this point.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VLWf4HsQuezz6okUWhEFKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-honor-magic-7-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLWf4HsQuezz6okUWhEFKU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Chang told me the Pixel team "investigated a solution for flicker-sensitive users and determined that enabling this new feature to adjust the EM frequency to 480 Hz would deliver an improvement for most people." I'm not sure where this idea originated, but it wasn't based on scientific evidence.</p><h2 id="there-s-another-option-2">There's another option</h2><p>PWM dimming isn't the only option for OLED displays. DC-like dimming helps many flicker-sensitive users and has become a standard on nearly every smartphone except those made by Apple, Samsung, or Google.</p><p>I asked about the possibility of future updates (or even Pixels) delivering a similar dimming mode, but I was again disappointed with the answer.</p><p>"We're always exploring new tech to make our products even better," Chang told me. "We also believe that new technologies should only be used when they're actually helpful and meet our high quality standards.</p><p>In this case, Pixel’s display already uses a combination of different dimming methods, and we're always looking for opportunities to improve our approach with each new generation based on our users’ feedback and as technology evolves."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AgLVxQVutBJR69pAoQYnJb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-homescreen-01" alt="Holding a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL while looking at the homescreen with weather and Gemini widgets on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AgLVxQVutBJR69pAoQYnJb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That last part gives me hope that Google isn't done listening to users like me. I wanted to be excited about finally using a Pixel full-time again without worrying that it would worsen my flicker sensitivity, but it looks like I'll have to wait for that to become a reality.</p><p>Chang also told me that "the Pixel display driver utilizes dithering in various places in our display pipeline." While I'm thankfully not negatively affected by dithering, a technique that alters colors on a display by rapidly flickering pixels on and off, many users are and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">filed grievances with Google</a> over the process.</p><h2 id="the-real-goal-2">The real goal</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="idKGfsTxrzQF3YGNHtra2Z" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-display-settings" alt="Display options on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with colorful flowers in the foreground" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idKGfsTxrzQF3YGNHtra2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For me, a good display isn't defined by its brightness level, color accuracy, or how far over 100% a display can reproduce a color spectrum. It's defined by comfort, with any other metrics and wins as secondary. If I can't use a display, I don't care about other specs; they're simply a nonstarter if I get a headache the moment I look at it.</p><p>No normal customer is going to look at any modern smartphone and see an image quality difference. It simply isn't reality, and the silly metrics these companies chase with their displays aren't just unrealistic, they're legitimately painful for those of us who can't look at them.</p><p>This is where the Pixel display team — in addition to both Samsung and Apple's display teams — seems to fully misunderstand the goal at hand.

If you thought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> or the rumored iPhone 17 Air were thin, the Spark and Pova Slim will blow you away. The former measures just 5.93mm thick, and the latter is only 5.95mm while adding 5G and still delivering a flagship experience.</p><p>TECNO managed to cram a 5,160mAh battery inside the Pova Slim, addressing the biggest drawback that comes with thin phones — battery life. When it's time to charge, 45W fast wired charging will get you topped off in a pinch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vHaRiRCCVdSqTft42kyrwT" name="Tecno-Pova-Slim-2" alt="The TECNO Pova Slim in the hand at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHaRiRCCVdSqTft42kyrwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6400 chipset and runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Best of all, it's no longer a concept and will soon be available for purchase in certain markets. Pricing and availability are to be announced, but nevertheless, TECNO's new Slim lineup is a feat of engineering that represents the best of smartphone technology at IFA 2025.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-concept-lenovo-thinkbook-vertiflex"><span>Best concept: Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NEkMWcmXQb3itwKGR8vp7g" name="Thinkbook-Vertiflex-2" alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEkMWcmXQb3itwKGR8vp7g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android phone lovers are very familiar with emerging form factors, like foldable phones and rotating screens (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg/revisiting-the-lg-wing-in-2025">LG Wing, anyone?</a>). Now, Lenovo is showing off a proof-of-concept at Lenovo Innovation World 2025 that brings a rotating screen to the ultrabook category. The Lenovo ThinkPad VertiFlex concept feels like your average 14-inch notebook until you flip the display upward, switching from horizontal to vertical orientations.</p><p>At 17.9mm thick and weighing just over three pounds, the ThinkPad VertiFlex won't feel out of place at a coffee shop or in your bag while packing a neat party trick. Switching to a vertical orientation on the fly might make common tasks like writing or coding easier in a way we've never seen on a laptop.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HnTqfjPRnLPkVztvsr4MQg" name="Thinkbook-Vertiflex-1" alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HnTqfjPRnLPkVztvsr4MQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I briefly played around with the VertiFlex concept and was surprised at how natural and premium the experience felt. Despite the moving parts and complex engineering, rotating the display back and forth was natural and simple. It's also cool that you can place a phone or tablet next to the rotated display when it's in a vertical orientation.</p><p>While the ThinkPad VertiFlex might never see store shelves, it's the best new concept to come out of IFA 2025.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-tablet-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra"><span>Best tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No one in the tablet space is doing what Samsung did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on#section-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a>. While it might not be my personal choice for a daily driver, it's impossible to ignore this tablet — it's the biggest and best on the Android side of things. You get a massive 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen and a chip upgrade in the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus.</p><p>This time around, it's only 5.1mm thin. You might be thinking, "Why does a tablet need to be thin?" It doesn't, unless you want to use it as a laptop alternative with a keyboard case. The thin tablet paired with Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard Slim helps make the entire package more compact.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More importantly, Samsung is taking real steps to make sure tablet users can actually take advantage of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra's raw power. There is still work to be done, but the new version of Samsung DeX called Extended Mode is a major addition. It lets you take advantage of both your Galaxy Tab S11 screen and an external monitor at the same time. With workspaces, you can create up to four separate desktop environments for different processes and goals in DeX mode.</p><p>It's not for everyone, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is the best tablet we saw at IFA, by a long shot.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wearable-hypershell-x-ultra"><span>Best wearable: Hypershell X Ultra</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJwgRPvGYwZ8M3HvXb7Qk" name="Hypershell-X-Ultra-1" alt="The Hypershell X Ultra on display behind a treadmill at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJwgRPvGYwZ8M3HvXb7Qk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Robotics, machine learning, and wearable tech always make for an interesting product. The Hypershell X Ultra is an exoskeleton that combines all three, and after a natural degree of skepticism, my extended hands-on time with the gear left me amazed. It uses ML algorithms to analyze your walking patterns and motions, anticipating your next step while using motors to lift your leg up before you do. This is all happening in real-time with low latency.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cL7wGn3qnLE3FPAUdbmTc3" name="Hypershell-X-Ultra-2" alt="The Hypershell X Ultra at IFA 2025 being worn showing the battery pack." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cL7wGn3qnLE3FPAUdbmTc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hiking with the Hypershell X Ultra is still physically taxing, and you might end up out of breath depending on your cardiovascular endurance. However, it requires significantly less leg power and reduces stress on your legs and joints. I walked, hiked, and ran with the exoskeleton, and immediately noticed a difference between turning assistance on and off.</p><p>It sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but following an announcement at IFA, you can actually buy this.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-home-philips-hue"><span>Best smart home: Philips Hue</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZCmbMAHbpiR8k3rrvJCBMY" name="philips-hue-a19-bulb-spec-up-3" alt="The Philips Hue A19 lightbulb and Bridge Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCmbMAHbpiR8k3rrvJCBMY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Philips)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/philips-hue">Philips Hue ecosystem</a> received a major refresh at IFA 2025, taking one of smart home's best brands to the next level.

The smart lightbulbs now work with Matter-over-Thread, and that's a big deal. The functionality allows users to connect A19 lightbulbs with any Matter platform, including Apple and Google Home, without needing an expensive Philips Hue bridge. All these upgrades are also available on Philips' more expensive bulbs, too.</p><p>The addition of Matter-over-Thread support to the best lightbulbs in the market makes Philips Hue our pick for best smart home tech at IFA 2025.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-ai-innovation-rokid-glasses"><span>Best AI innovation: Rokid Glasses</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KeTUWvKvPVcUjyw9QfRwJA" name="Rokid-Glasses-1" alt="The Rokid Glasses on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KeTUWvKvPVcUjyw9QfRwJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rokid Glasses are the XR wearable that Rokid has been building up to for years, and they incorporate AI at the core.

At only $599, these smart glasses, currently in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.rokid.com/pages/rokid-glasses" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> stage, are the best AI innovation to launch at IFA 2025.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Lenovo and Hypershell provided travel and lodging for part of my IFA 2025 trip, but had no input in this article.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/alleged-galaxy-s26-dummy-units-edge-might-look-like-apple-leak">renders that leaked recently</a>, its back is dominated by a camera island that spans nearly the phone’s entire width.</p><p>The design looks strikingly similar to what’s been leaked for Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, suggesting Samsung might be borrowing some cues.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Ultra stay in the comfort zone, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/a-first-look-at-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-suggests-samsung-is-playing-it-safe/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>.

The S26 Edge drops from 5.8 mm to about 5.5 mm; the Pro goes from 7.2 to 6.7 mm; the Ultra trims to 7.8 mm from 8.2 mm. If anything, these numbers are flirting with featherweight territory.</p><p>On the hardware front, the Pro model is shaping up with a clear set of specs. It's reportedly configured with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. For photography, it leans on a triple-camera array: a 50 MP main sensor, joined by a 12 MP ultrawide and a 10 MP telephoto lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-render" alt="Galaxy S26 Pro CAD render  showing the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Power will likely come from a 4,300mAh battery, supporting 45W wired charging and Qi2 wireless with integrated magnets.

Configurations could go up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p><p>The rear setup is expected to include four cameras: a 200MP main, a 50MP periscope with a wider aperture than the S25 Ultra, a 50MP ultrawide, and an upgraded 12MP short-range telephoto. Reported dimensions come in at 163.4 x 77.9 x 7.8 mm.</p><p>The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultras-updated-design-could-make-it-the-most-comfortable-yet">expected to shift away from the sharp, boxy look</a> of earlier models, adopting a rounder, more curved design similar to the S25 Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="dBjTLfwvBKNyqiPbVXtDEP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Ultra-render" alt="Galaxy S26 Ultra render showing the back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBjTLfwvBKNyqiPbVXtDEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This leak doesn’t show fresh images of the Galaxy S26 Edge but does lay out its rumored specs.

It may offer up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, along with a 200MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 4,300mAh battery.</p><p>All three models seem to feature Qi2 magnetic charging, meaning better alignment and possible accessory perks, like magnetic cases or snap-on batteries.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> introduced a new design language with much better build quality, and it addressed long-standing hardware issues. That said, the underwhelming nature of the Tensor G4 meant the 9 Pro XL wasn't quite up to scratch.</p><p>Thankfully, that's changing with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone retains a similar design as last year, and that's a good thing. Although it makes it look unquestionably like an iPhone, the build quality is fantastic, and it has a good presence — particularly in the Moonstone variant I'm using. The dull blue luster accentuates the design quite well, and the in-hand feel is pretty good thanks to the matte texture.</p><h2 id="a-design-that-s-unquestionably-google-2">A design that's unquestionably Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The camera bar at the back gives Google's phones a distinctive look, and it looks great while ensuring there's no wobble when using the phone on a table.

Google somehow managed to ace this category, and the 10 Pro XL has fantastic color vibrancy and brightness levels. There are no issues with the ambient light sensor (something that plagued previous Pixels I used), and it does a good job maintaining 120Hz refresh.</p><p>There's good news on the hardware side of things as well, with Google switching to TSMC's 3nm node this time. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> brings much-needed upgrades, and it is noticeably faster than its predecessors. Google is using the same Cortex X4 core to do the heavy lifting this time around, but the increased 3.78GHz clock means it doesn't need to be active for as long.</p><p>The switch to Imagination Technologies' PowerVR DXT-48 means the Pixel 10 Pro XL isn't hobbled at gaming. It does a much better job in this regard, and while it still tends to throttle earlier than other phones, it isn't anywhere as extreme as previous Pixels. That alone is a huge deal, and it makes using the 10 Pro XL that much better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="yuHwjvLiV2r9Q26vMpGgDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuHwjvLiV2r9Q26vMpGgDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5066" height="2854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't get me wrong; the Tensor G5 still lags behind what Qualcomm and MediaTek have to offer, but it doesn't feel as limiting as previous generations. The 10 Pro XL manages thermals better, and it doesn't have any of the overheating issues that plagued earlier models.</p><p>The Tensor G5 also has much better efficiency, and while the Pixel 10 Pro XL doesn't last as long as its Chinese rivals, it goes a day without breaking a sweat. I'm still annoyed that Google continues to limit its charging protocol to 45W — it's time the brand started leveraging the 100W standard available with USB PD 3.0.</p><p>On the subject of charging, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has the distinction of being the only Android phone to have Qi 2 integration natively; the phone has the requisite magnets built in, and it's a good move by Google. It's exciting to be able to use Qi 2 accessories without needing a case, and the 10 Pro XL manages to hit 25W over the Qi 2 standard with relative ease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7CdkRkJNRuETWFDy5NXYv9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CdkRkJNRuETWFDy5NXYv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's a small thing, it's good to see Google finally switch to 256GB of storage in the base model of the 10 Pro XL.

I have no doubt that I'll fill up the storage on the phone in a matter of months, and Google annoyingly doesn't sell the 512GB or 1TB variants of the device in India, limiting the phone's potential.</p><p>The brand instead points to the 2TB Google One storage tier that's bundled with the phone (all Pixel 10 Pro XL buyers get a year of Google AI Pro) as an alternative, but that doesn't get away from the fact that you'll need to pay over $200 from the second year just to store your data.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-stand-out-2">Cameras that stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4879px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4879" height="2748" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixels always delivered great cameras, and that's no different this year.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Looking to pick up a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses this year? You might want to hold off on that decision, as Meta's annual product conference will kick off on September 17, and we're expecting the company to unveil new smart glasses.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> have been one of Meta's most successful products to date, garnering tons of attention worldwide and selling millions of units. You may not be aware that these glasses are actually second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses, as the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> weren't nearly as popular.</p><p>Part of the success was greatly improved hardware between the first and second generation, while the other part has been the excitement of Meta AI being built into Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</p><p>Since we're anticipating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)</a> to be announced at Meta Connect 2025, my recommendation is to wait and see what Meta will unveil and how much better they might be over Ray-Ban's current offerings. For now, let's go over the potential differences based on what we know to help you make a decision now.</p><h2 id="the-upgrades-we-could-get-with-the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-2">The upgrades we could get with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-inspecting-01" alt="Inspecting the inside of transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses before putting them on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) are expected to come in two main varieties: sunglasses and prescription glasses. The currently available Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are offered in three different traditional Ray-Ban styles, each with a selection of colors and lens types. However, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again" target="_blank">is unable to offer all types of prescriptions</a> due to the frame styles.</p><p>Separating prescription and sunglasses styles would likely allow these prescription glasses users to utilize the new generation of smart glasses. If you've already taken a look at the available prescription options for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and can't get what you need, you should definitely wait and see what's available with the new rumored style options.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.83%;"><img id="jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="882" height="854" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Folks who are looking to primarily take photos or videos with their smart glasses should also wait to see what upgrades Meta will deliver with the camera on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3). The recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> smart glasses offer a notable camera upgrade for folks recording active video. If you plan to take your smart glasses out for a run, hike, or even while playing sports, waiting for a potential camera upgrade is a good option.</p><p>That's because the higher-resolution camera allows Meta to offer better image stabilization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">keeping the video jitter-free and bump-free</a>, almost no matter what you do. We don't expect any other camera upgrades over what Meta just delivered with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, though, but Meta could always surprise us with AI super resolution or something.</p><h2 id="meta-ai-but-better-2">Meta AI, but better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.53%;"><img id="yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1038" height="867" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of Meta AI, we're expecting a big upgrade for Meta AI on all of the company's upcoming smart glasses. That should include Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), as it's likely the company will include a new chipset that's able to do even more than the two-year-old chipset in the current Ray-Ban Meta product.</p><p>This upgraded Meta AI is said to be able to provide longer interaction sessions, including additional live AI time with recording storage. Meta AI will be able to pull up data from your personal recordings on request, helping you remember where you left your car keys, the coffee mug, or even someone's name whom you previously addressed.</p><p>Google's upcoming Android XR-powered smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">are also able to perform these functions</a>, and we fully expect any competing Meta smart glasses to be able to do it, too.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-price-2">What about the price?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-case-and-meta-ai-app-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses next to the glasses charging case and the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, any upgrade discussion isn't complete without a price. While there are currently no rumors regarding the price of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), we don't expect Meta to launch them at a wildly different price range than what's currently available.</p><p>At the most, they'll probably retail for $400-500, just like Oakley Meta HSTN. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-hypernova">Meta Hypernova</a>, the other, more advanced smart glasses that we expect to see unveiled at Meta Connect, are rumored to retail for $800, and there's no expectation that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) will cost anywhere near that price since they aren't expected to feature any display technology like the Hypernova.</p><p>Still, there's a high chance that they <em>could</em> be more expensive than the $250-300 price tag you would spend on the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but we'll have to wait and see. At the least, if Meta does release its new smart glasses before the end of the year, you could always pick up a discounted pair of Gen 2s during this year's Black Friday sales in November.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c1735587-6b06-45b0-9158-2d5ac1458a8b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBRsqTgAExr7KEXFFcCH9N.jpg' alt="A render of four different styles of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses stacked atop one another in a white void."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Style meets intelligence with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses!

But Garmin keeps reporting record-setting profits on watches while bumping up prices across its entire lineup. Who's to say the Fenix 8 Pro won't find a credulous audience? It's still cheaper than a Rolex!</p><p>In 2025, Garmin fans have grumbled about higher watch costs, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus subscription</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watches-are-reportedly-crashing-displaying-a-blue-triangle">massive bootloop crash</a>, and especially when Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/has-garmin-abandoned-the-fenix-7-pro-after-just-1-5-years/">cut off new features for the year-old Fenix 7 Pro</a> to push the Fenix 8. "I'll never buy a Garmin watch again" has been a pretty common refrain on forums, and rivals like COROS and Polar would happily take their business.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6986px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-3" alt="A photo of a man in the mountains wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to check his nearby mapped location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6986" height="3929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The 4,500-nit Garmin Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This hasn't stopped Garmin from climbing into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP53613925">5th-best-selling wearable brand in 2025</a>, with a nearly 30% year-over-year growth, closing in on Samsung in 4th.

It usually takes 2–3 years to sell a new watch in each lineup, and it charges more for every new feature.

Displays and side rails are almost universally flat across companies and product lines. Batteries are big. Ultrawide and telephoto cameras are all but standard. Even the corners of phones are nearly all rounded out. Some of these trends are great, others I could do without.</p><p>But, for far too many years, companies have used ugly, annoying protruding lenses that are too often aligned to the top-left of the phone. This not only makes the lenses prone to breaking if the phone is dropped, but it also makes the phone uneven. Everyone knows how much phones wobble when placed on a table, and it's annoying as heck.</p><p>However, the upcoming iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S26 both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge" target="_blank">appear to be adopting</a> Google's superior camera bar design, one that not only centers the camera configuration but also creates a nice, even, horizontal camera island in place of raised lenses. I think it's better for any number of reasons, and it looks like it's finally becoming the standard.</p><h2 id="down-with-raised-lenses-2">Down with raised lenses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DUcrUhphpMsCLyfbKF6m28" name="pixel-10-pro-vs-iphone-17-air-vs-iphone-17-pro-vs-samsung-galaxy-s26" alt="Leaked renders of the iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Air, and Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge alongside an official render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUcrUhphpMsCLyfbKF6m28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Galaxy S26 render via Android Headlines, Pixel 10 render via Google, iPhone 17 render via Majin Buu (on X))</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above, you'll see leaked renders of the Apple iPhone 17 Air, Apple iPhone 17 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge, and an official render of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a>. There's no denying the similarities here.</p><p>Ever since the Pixel 6, Google has shown the world that a camera bar is the superior way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">to house all that clunky camera hardware</a> in an elegant fashion. After all, there's no way to keep a phone feeling thin and still deliver the camera quality people want without a big ol' camera lens sticking out of the back. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are probably the epitome of this concept.</p><p>However, many companies attempted to take the "simple" approach by placing the camera sensors behind large, protruding lenses on the backs of phones.

That's right, both Samsung and Apple seem to have misunderstood <em>the entire purpose</em> of the camera island.</p><p>Instead of flattening the backs and completely solving the problem of asymmetry and wobble, both of these companies have only reduced those issues. The lenses still protrude, and while there's little doubt that these all will wobble less than previous designs, this should have solved those issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's excellent camera visor design is not only completely flat across the entire surface, but it has a really classy layer of metal trimming the outside and the right quarter of the design. This helps beef up durability over time and reduces the number of glass surfaces that could break in the event of a drop.</p><h2 id="google-is-setting-a-design-standard-2">Google is setting a design standard</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3671px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-21" alt="The Pixel 10 lying flat on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3671" height="2065" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm really glad to see the camera visor making its way into a more standardized smartphone design format, even if Google still does it best.

With 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, you have the power and storage necessary for speedy Wear OS apps and music storage. And it has a rugged design rated MIL-STD-810-H for protection.</p><p>Considering most cheap Wear OS watches cost about $200, snagging a new model for a little over $100 is about as cheap as you'll find. <a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d210a6bc-2424-41a9-9bb4-e90ef736fece" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="TicWatch Pro 5: $349.99" data-dimension48="TicWatch Pro 5: $349.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a fast, rugged watch that prioritizes third-party apps; you hate having to charge your watch daily; and your first priority is saving money, followed by good Android integration.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the newest Wear OS software with Gemini; you care more about a small, comfortable design than battery life; or you don't really need watch apps.</p><p>The closest Wear OS equivalent to the TicWatch Pro 5 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which has an identical 1.43-inch display, Snapdragon chipset, and a battery life average of three days.

Why is this watch so inexpensive?" The answer is that TicWatches have a downside compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>: They don't support Gemini or Google Assistant. For whatever reason, Mobvoi hasn't managed to get the signature app working on its watches.</p><p>You also have to accept that it still runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, though it will hopefully jump to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> soon. For comparison, newer Android watches will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, supporting all the latest app upgrades and UI improvements.</p><p>We wouldn't recommend getting the TicWatch Pro 5 at full price ($349) when you could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> for the same price. But at $109? You'll never see a new Google or Samsung watch at that price; you'd have to compare the TicWatch Pro 5 against budget brands like Amazfit that can't compete with Wear OS for software, even if it's an older version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what I didn't expect to like as much as I did is Google's flavor of Android 16. It's vibrant, responsive, and it brings some welcome changes that I've been hoping to see on Pixel software.</p><p>That said, the Pixel UI has never been my favorite, and while I like the changes Google has made with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, there are still some things I would like to see Google implement in future versions of Android. In fact, many of these features feel so commonplace on other Android phones, I'm surprised Google hasn't implemented them on Pixels.</p><h2 id="quick-settings-2">Quick Settings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-03" alt="Quick Settings on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4183" height="2353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps my favorite change to Pixel UI is with the Quick settings. I wasn't a huge fan of the unnecessarily large tiles in previous versions, which limited the number of tiles you could view at a time compared to One UI. But now, Google lets you customize the Quick Settings panel more than I thought it would ever allow.</p><p>You can now resize any tile simply by long-pressing it. You only get two choices, which are essentially 1x1 or 2x1, but it allows you to fit more tiles onto the panel and provide it with more personality, letting you highlight the most important tiles if you so choose.</p><p>That said, there still are some annoying quirks that haven't been addressed with Android 16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-4" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4223" height="2375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a feature called "Quick Settings," I feel like it's not that great at actually offering quick access to some essential settings. For some reason, it takes two swipes of the panel in order to access the brightness slider, which is annoying when I want to quickly adjust it beyond the auto brightness.</p><p>Additionally, the actual Settings button is also inaccessible until the second swipe. Sure, I could have an icon on the home screen or swipe through the app drawer, but I prefer not to clutter my home screen with apps/widgets. I may just be spoiled by Samsung's Quick Settings, which gives you immediate access to the Settings icon after one swipe down.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-08" alt="Holding the Moto G Power 2025 and showing the quick settings panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I would love to see Google add an option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-change-back-to-single-notification-quick-settings-panel-one-ui-7">separate the notification panel and Quick Settings menu</a>. I've gotten used to this on Samsung and Motorola phones, and I have started to prefer it since it shows more tiles or notifications at once, and I can easily swipe between the two panels.</p><h2 id="multitasking-2">Multitasking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-5" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with the multitasking view open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Google is focused on improving the multitasking experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, the experience on its traditional phones feels a bit lacking.</p><p>The Open Apps view simply displays large cards side by side, which doesn't offer a particularly helpful view of your apps. This isn't a huge deal, but it doesn't feel as useful as the Open Apps view from other OEMs. Furthermore, while access to features like Screenshot and the text selector are useful, I would like the option to see recommended apps to quickly jump into one.</p><p>Also, it doesn't make sense to me that I have to swipe all the way to the right in order to find the Clear All button. Even Motorola allows me to open the view and tap Clear All without swiping. I can also lock an app to the Open Apps view so that it stays open when I clear the rest, which is helpful when I'm streaming YouTube Music, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-6" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Razr Ultra 2025 with an open side panel of apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One feature I've been begging to see on Pixels is a native side panel. This is a space to quickly access your favorite or most-used apps simply by swiping from the side of the display on nearly any screen. It's incredibly useful, and usually the first thing I set up when using a new phone. It's also available on just about every other smartphone I've tested, from Samsung to TECNO, so it's odd that Google <em>still </em>hasn't included an option for it, despite giving us a taskbar on foldables.</p><h2 id="more-customization-2">More customization</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-7" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> come with some level of customization, and the Pixel UI has improved on this front, especially with the aforementioned Quick Settings. That said, while there is a decent amount of customization, I would like to see more.</p><p>The Open Apps view is just one example; Google should let us <em>choose</em> the style in which apps are presented. Same with the Quick Settings menu; we should be able to further rearrange, resize, and change the style of the tiles and panel. Samsung does a great job of letting you rearrange the different elements on Quick Settings, and that would be a great starting point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-stacked-widget" alt="A stacked widget on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3008" height="1692" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But even more than that, Google should let us customize other aspects of the Pixel UI, such as the shape of app icons and content shown on the status bar, allowing us to choose which icons we want presented and how. OnePlus offers this on its phones, and I always appreciated this as a way to declutter the top of my screen.</p><p>And as someone who prefers a cleaner home screen, I would also love to be able to stack widgets.</p><h2 id="best-of-both-worlds-2">Best of both worlds?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-1" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with Google Lock open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of smaller things, too, which could add up to some pretty granular customization options. However, Android has always been about providing its users with options, and while many like the Pixel UI for what it is, offering the option for deeper customization could go a long way.</p><p>Maybe Google could launch a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>-style app (perhaps called "Pixelate"), which gives users more ways to customize their phones without Google needing to mess with the core Pixel experience.

While they may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1963012916875231354" target="_blank">complaining on social media</a>, CEOs of companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/brave-browser-secretly-installing-vpn">Brave</a> know that nobody will continue to support the code base that makes their product possible the way Google has been doing.</p><h2 id="who-are-the-losers-2">Who are the losers?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo" name="Microsoft-logo.jpg" alt="The Microsoft logo at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3774" height="2123" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When someone "wins," it means someone has to lose as well. I see two outright losers from this decision: Microsoft and Internet publishers.</p><p>Microsoft doesn't need Google to continue to support and maintain Chromium, even though its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/have-you-tried-microsofts-new-edge-browser">Edge browser</a> uses the engine. It's entirely capable of doing it and would have been happy to do so if it meant its web browser market share could grow as Chrome collapsed. Having Google still doing most everything it has been doing means Microsoft will need to spend more money to compete.</p><p>Lastly, internet publishers will now see Google, whose AI is already affecting business models, sharing some of the data it collects with competitors. That means even more AI companies will be able to sidestep actual web articles in favor of an AI-generated response, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">reducing web traffic and revenue</a> for the companies producing the content. Many had hoped for some sort of "opt-out" of AI web indexing without being penalized in proper search results, but that was not part of the ruling.</p><h2 id="so-what-about-us-2">So what about us?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV" name="google-io-2021-keynote-3-billion-android-devices.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2021 Keynote 3 Billion Android Devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's interesting to see how this court ruling will affect the finances of tech companies, what's most important to me (and many of you) is what it means for us, the over 3 billion Google customers who use the company's products and services.</p><p>The news is decidedly neutral. The suit may have been brought to protect users like you and me, but the result doesn't really do much there.

The latest leak comes from Android Headlines via prominent tipster On Leaks, which got their hands on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge">official-looking CAD renders</a> of the Galaxy S26 Edge, giving us a closer look at the device.</p><p>Right off the bat, the renders showcase the device from all angles and seem to have a flatter display, with a front camera at the top. You can also spot thinner bezels on the device, with the power button on the right side, with the volume controls right above it.  The frame of the phone is also slightly more sqaured off as well.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad...

Instead, in 2025, we're seeing the Ear 3 finally come around. While the Nothing Ear can handle rumbling bass and sub-bass, with other such audio refinements, it remains to be seen how the Ear 3 takes things further.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Screen protectors are Android phone accessories that feel almost mandatory to keep your gadgets safe against cracks and scratches. However, as a review that tests many phones and even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a>, I find them to be wildly inconvenient. They're difficult to apply, it can be hard to find them in stock at stores near you when you need them, and can need replacing often. There might be a better way, and I tried it at the Zagg booth at IFA 2025.</p><p>Zagg's On-Demand InvisibleShield machine is sort of like a kiosk for custom screen protectors. Name just about any device model and pick a film screen protector variant, like matte or privacy, and order it like you would a coffee. There is information for thousands of devices stored in the Zagg On Demand machine, with the precise measurements for each.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-4" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This wide-ranging support for phone and device models is extremely useful for niche models, or new and old ones. For instance, if you want to get a screen protector in your home country for a phone that isn't generally available there — think using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> in the U.S. — you're probably out of luck at a big box retailer. However, a shop with an On Demand machine can cut a film for your uncommon device or ten-year-old phone in minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-5" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you name your device, you'll need to pick a film screen protector type. A notable limitation of the On Demand machine is that it can't cut tempered glass screen protectors, only TPU film. A Zagg representative told me that's why there aren't as many Zagg On Demand service providers in the U.S. as there are in Europe; the American market prefers tempered glass over film.</p><p>Personally, I find matte film screen protectors to be the perfect mix of feature set and protection. The matte finish helps diffuse sunlight for better visibility, and the film protects your screen from scratches without being another thing for you to crack.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-3" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can choose from Zagg's InvisibleShield Defense, Elite, or Extreme film screen protector types depending on the feel you're looking for. From there, you can choose either Ultra Eco (biodegradable), Ultra Matte (anti-glare), Elite VisionGuard (blue-light blocking), or Privacy Matte versions. After that, an operator will put your chosen film into the machine, it'll precision-cut it, and soon it'll be ready to be applied.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-1" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In just a few minutes, you'll end up with something like I did in the photo above — a phone with a cut-to-order screen protector. I was fascinated by the process, and find there to be a few major advantages to this kind of service. For one, you're getting an expert to install your screen protector. If you don't like how it turns out, you can address that right then and there without having to go through a return or warranty process.</p><p>There's also the fact that this process allows stores to provide screen protectors for far more devices than they ever could with pre-packaged kits. It's an approach that uses less waste as well. Even large retailers like Best Buy struggle to keep a variety of screen protectors in stock for same-day pickup, but with Zagg On Demand, it's nearly instant.</p><p>Zagg has been using On Demand machines for over five years now, and I hope they catch on more. It's cool to watch, and has too many practical benefits for both businesses and customers to ignore.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lau confirmed that OnePlus is in the process of developing its new DetailMax Engine to deliver "clarity and authenticity" for users and their captured photos. Lau states that, to create the DetailMax Engine, he was involved in interviews with a wide range of users about what they want most out of such software.</p><p>Users informed OnePlus that they want "clear and real" photos, and pictures that remain crisp and detailed even when pinching to zoom.</p><p>Lau says the company's DetailMax Engine computational imaging software has evolved to a point where it can "capture and interpret vastly more data, delivering images with unmatched depth and realism." The company states its new in-house engine will never mask photos with "over-beautification or distortion," once again highlighting the true-to-life, in a way, appeal of a user's photography.</p><p>Lau informs users that testing for the early prototype is underway, and that he's been involved in it so far. The company says the engine should be ready by launch, meaning all the wrinkles and things should be ironed out. Lau thanks Hasselblad for guiding OnePlus toward this imaging future it's racing toward and states it's excited for new opportunities, whatever those may be.</p><h2 id="the-end-of-an-era-2">The End of an Era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/more-rumors-oneplus-15-in-house-camera-system-reported">settle with rumors</a> about OnePlus' supposed departure from Hasselblad thus far, and the most recent ones shed more (alleged) light on it.
