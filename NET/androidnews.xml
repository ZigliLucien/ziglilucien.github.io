Do you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">tablet for reading books</a> or streaming TV shows? Do you need a powerhouse of performance for gaming or heavy file management? Answering this question first is crucial to deciding which tablet is right for you.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-cheap-android-tablet-2">What is the best cheap Android tablet?</h2><p>If I had to pick one tablet around 200 bucks (or less), it'd be the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. Regularly discounted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Speakers-Upgraded-Graphite/dp/B0CLF3VPMV"><strong>around $199.99,</strong></a> this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a> boasts a lightweight aluminum build with great battery life and a few premium specs you don't usually get in this price range, such as stereo speakers and a microSD card slot.</p><p>If you want to spend even less, it's worth mentioning that the Amazon Fire line of tablets offers great bang for the buck. The Amazon Fire HD 8, for instance, is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Display-designed-portable-entertainment/dp/B0CVDS6WFQ"><strong>chilling at just 70 bucks</strong></a> during Amazon's holiday sale.</p><h2 id="can-i-use-a-tablet-instead-of-a-laptop-2">Can I use a tablet instead of a laptop?</h2><p>Definitely! Many of the best Android tablets deliver as much performance as a modern laptop, and it's an easy way to have a dual-purpose device that you can take with you wherever you go. You can even pair your new device with a keyboard case for the full laptop experience. The only catch is that you should expect to pay a pretty penny for models that offer laptop-level performance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But other than that, there isn't anything remotely exciting about the 15R, and it is about as interesting as a middle seat on a 16-hour flight (trust me).</p><p>It's almost as if the designers had a month at an exotic location design inspiration journey to come up with the look of the phone, had a whale of a time, realized on the last day that they didn't get any actual work done, and just stretched out the 13s to "create" a new device.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Nj2iccdBjHgqR59mM9rZ6T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nj2iccdBjHgqR59mM9rZ6T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Xn4qQsrJmjFLdFvPyxKGXT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xn4qQsrJmjFLdFvPyxKGXT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="r6fA6TUETLdjmKndmMMZ4T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6fA6TUETLdjmKndmMMZ4T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The only fun thing with the design is an Electric Violet color variant, but in characteristic OnePlus fashion, it is limited to India. Now, I would've had something to talk about the design had I got that variant, but there just isn't much to say about the black model other than it's mundane.</p><p>Thankfully, the device gets the same IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance as the OnePlus 15, so you can use it outdoors without any worries. That said, the phone uses the custom Panda glass, and it isn't quite as resilient to tumbles as Corning's solution.</p><h2 id="cameras-you-ll-be-embarrassed-to-use-in-public-2">Cameras you'll be embarrassed to use in public </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest issue is with the camera; the OnePlus 15R doesn't have a telephoto lens, instead offering a 50MP main camera and an 8MP wide-angle lens. Last year's OnePlus 13R came with a 50MP telephoto (which was actually good!), so you're basically getting a phone that's not even as good as its predecessor.</p><p>Obviously, this was something I asked the manufacturer in a product briefing, and I got a truly ridiculous answer: OnePlus says that its DetailMax imaging engine is so good that it didn't see the need to fit a dedicated telephoto lens on the 15R. Great! Now we can tell OPPO, Vivo, Samsung, Google, Huawei, Honor, and all the other brands to ditch their efforts in this area, and focus solely on software.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

The OnePlus 15R has objectively worse cameras than the 13R, and the lack of a telephoto lens is egregious enough to be a deal-breaker. But hey, OnePlus says the 15R has the best selfie camera of any of its phones, using the same module as last year's OnePlus 13s.</p><p>The main camera itself is decent — it uses the same Sony IMX906 module as the OnePlus 15, and it does a good enough job in challenging situations. I don't have an issue with the main camera, but it is annoying to see OnePlus once again intentionally hobble the device by not including a tele lens.</p><h2 id="you-get-great-internals-and-the-same-old-foibles-2">You get great internals — and the same old foibles</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus put a 6.83-inch 1.5K LTPS AMOLED panel on the 15R, and it is very good. It has standout colors, gets bright, and is easy on the eyes. It doesn't go down to 1Hz, and while it is billed as a 165Hz panel, it doesn't use the 144Hz or 165Hz modes outside of six games. In all other scenarios, you get the same 120Hz refresh as all other devices in this category.</p><p>It's annoying that most games are still limited to 60fps, and although OnePlus says it is focusing on gaming, I don't see that in real-world use. The phone does a good job while gaming, and the bigger panel is particularly good in this regard, but I would've liked to see it hit its full potential.</p><p>On that note, the device is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, and I'm just as confused as you are when it comes to Qualcomm's naming convention. It isn't clocked as high as this year's Elite variant, and you get pretty good performance — it is similar to that of last year's iQOO 13. OnePlus says it added a new 360-degree cooling system on the device, but it doesn't do much to curtail overheating.</p><p>Another new feature OnePlus added is a G2 Wi-Fi module, noting that it delivers better connectivity. Having used the phone, I didn't see a difference in connectivity versus other devices that use Qualcomm's built-in Wi-Fi modem, and I don't really understand why OnePlus even bothered.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eT22gWcWqhXXFvWWPMvtST" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eT22gWcWqhXXFvWWPMvtST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus indicated that the DRAM situation isn't going to cause any bottlenecks, but it's clear that it is affected seeing as how there's no 16GB model this time: both the 256GB and 512GB storage variants come with 12GB of RAM as standard.</p><p>There's no doubt that the battery is the best feature on the 15R. The 7,400mAh battery is even bigger than that on the regular model, and it lasts up to two days without issues. Even with heavy use, you can easily get it to last a day and a half, and it uses 80W charging tech. It isn't a silicon battery, and you get a single-cell design to maximize density, but the battery life itself is among the best in this category.</p><h2 id="don-t-buy-the-oneplus-15r-2">Don't buy the OnePlus 15R</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't usually recommend older phones, but I will do so wholeheartedly here.

Since the Pixel 6, users have often reported their phones registering touches while locked and in their pockets.</p><p>Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that rely on proximity sensors and motion data to suppress touch input when a phone is pocketed, Pixel devices never shipped with a true accidental touch prevention or pocket mode.</p><p>As time went on, frustration grew in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/wlolb8/pixel_6_pro_pocket_dialing_emergency_contacts/" target="_blank">Reddit threads</a> and Google’s issue tracker. Owners shared stories of their phones dialing contacts without warning or waking the screen just enough to register unwanted touches.</p><h2 id="the-problem-runs-deep-2">The problem runs deep</h2><p>For some, the most worrying part was accidental emergency dialing, an issue that’s not just annoying but potentially serious. Google has recognized the problem before, but real solutions never arrived, so users had to rely on workarounds like turning off gesture-based wake features and giving up convenience to avoid pocket mishaps.</p><p>Now, things are changing. A Google engineer recently updated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/322569341#comment7" target="_blank">official issue tracker</a>, marked the accidental touch prevention bug as “fixed,” and told users to look out for future software updates (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/16/google-pixel-accidental-touch-prevention-fix-coming-future-update/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>).</p><p>While the company hasn’t announced the feature publicly or detailed how it works, this status change strongly suggests that Google has implemented a system-level solution that better detects when a Pixel is in a pocket or enclosed space and suppresses touch input accordingly.</p><p>This fix isn’t included in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">December Pixel update</a>, and it hasn’t been released quietly through a server-side change. Instead, it looks like it will arrive in a future Android update or Pixel Feature Drop, possibly in early 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not only the first phone to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor, but it's also one of the only phones to sport a 165Hz refresh rate OLED, too. That, combined with the 3200Hz touch sampling rate, makes this a truly superb gaming phone.</p><p>Not only that, but the OnePlus 15R churns out top-tier brightness levels and excellent outdoor visibility, all without compromising on eye care features. It's the first OnePlus phone with a 3840Hz PWM dimming rate, helping make it the most eye-friendly OLED we've tested to date.</p><p>It's the premium OLED experience we didn't expect in a $699 phone, and it not only rivals phones twice its price in every regard but eclipses them in eye safety features. Read on to find out all the nitty-gritty details!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-brightness-and-colors"><span>Eye comfort, brightness, and colors</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R8dYFjgbeqDHSbVEaFoPGG" name="oneplus-15r-eye-care-display" alt="The eye care features on the OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8dYFjgbeqDHSbVEaFoPGG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R's display represents the best of the best in OLED tech. It's extraordinarily bright when it needs to be, gets impressively dim in a dark room, and uses a dimming method that doesn't flicker the way Samsung and Google Pixel phones do. In fact, this phone sets a new bar for OLED flicker-free tech.</p><p>OLEDs are different from tech like LCDs because each pixel emits its own light, producing beautiful contrast. But OLEDs have to re-adjust the brightness each and every frame that's drawn, making them prone to flicker. Some phones use an additional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> layer on top of this, making the effect even worse and making it impossible for some people to use them.</p><p>But the OnePlus 15R's display sets a new bar for flicker-free OLEDs. It sports the lowest modulation I've ever seen from an OLED. Modulation is the percentage difference between the brightest and dimmest points during the refresh cycle. Lower is always better. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> have 99% modulation, meaning they fully turn off before turning on again. The OnePlus 15R gets as low as 3.89% modulation. That's not a typo.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="epteUrD9DMSzJ79gHtA7gT" name="oneplus-15r-pwm-graph" alt="Display flicker measurements from the OnePlus 15R using a 1/6400 shutter speed camera and an Opple Light Master IV light meter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epteUrD9DMSzJ79gHtA7gT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R uses DC dimming above 25% brightness and 3840Hz PWM dimming below that. Samsung and Google use a mere 480Hz rate, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">been shown to cause health issues</a> in studies. Not only is 3840Hz well within the safe range deemed by the IEEE PAR 1789 standard, but it's also the fastest rate we've seen yet on a OnePlus phone.</p><p>To make things even better, the modulation rate, even during the PWM cycle, is a record low of under 10%. I've <strong>never</strong> seen that on any phone, regardless of the price. It's a monumental win for OnePlus and the flicker-sensitive community, and great news for anyone who regularly uses this phone at low brightness.</p><p>It's also a <em>true</em> 10-bit panel, ensuring the phone doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to fake colors and add yet another layer of flickering to the experience.

That's almost identical to even more expensive phones like the Honor Magic 8 Pro (1256 pixels), but slightly lower than some phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra (1440 pixels). Regardless, this is a 450ppi display, and it's unlikely you'll ever notice a difference, especially if you're using the high resolution option.</p><p>The slightly lower resolution enables OnePlus to push 165Hz in a select few games, including popular shooters like Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, and Battlegrounds Mobile India. Just select 165FPS from the game's settings menu, and you'll be blown away by how smooth things are. Here's the full list:</p><ul><li>Call of Duty Mobile</li><li>Clash of Clans</li><li>Brawl Stars</li><li>Real Racing 3</li><li>Standoff 2</li><li>Blood Strike-FPS</li><li>Battlegrounds Mobile India</li><li>PUBG</li></ul><p>To make things better, the phone sports the same 3200Hz dedicated touch response chip as the more expensive OnePlus 15R. That means games feel notably more responsive, even if they don't support the  165Hz display refresh mode.</p><p>Since this uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor, it has plenty of power to run games at that frame rate, too. By default, games that support 165Hz drop details a bit, but it's usually just down to medium, not low. I prefer resolution over frame rate any time, but 165Hz modes don't lower resolution, only object detail.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R uses an LTPS OLED, which only supports a handful of specific refresh rates: 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and 165Hz. An LTPO display like the one on the OnePlus 15 can dynamically adjust from 1-165Hz. LTPO certainly looks better on paper, but LTPS displays are generally better for people with flicker sensitivity. That's because the refresh rate mathematically aligns with the dimming rate more closely than on LTPO displays.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-verdict"><span>Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QMXdmeTpA3yp26CJ4vYMLR" name="oneplus-15r-green-back-pine" alt="Holding a mint green OnePlus 15R in front of a pine tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QMXdmeTpA3yp26CJ4vYMLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm beyond impressed with the OLED display on the OnePlus 15R. It's not just the most flicker-free OLED I've <em>ever</em> tested, but it features the fastest refresh rate I've seen on a phone this side of a dedicated gaming phone (or a more expensive model like the OnePlus 15).</p><p>It does all that without sacrificing outdoor visibility or low light comfort and gets closer to perfecting OLEDs as we know it. It's funny, because I was impressed by the OnePlus 15's display just a few weeks ago, and now the 15R — a $200 cheaper phone — pushes the same brightness metrics with even better eye comfort.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is an LTPS display, which means the main refresh rates are 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and 165Hz. The OnePlus 15's LTPO display can drop as low as 1Hz, which could offer better power savings in some situations, but I'm not convinced this will make a difference for most people.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is also missing the OnePlus 15's video enhancement modes, which can convert SDR content to HDR or even upscale lower resolution content on the fly.

That's the case with Google Opal, an AI-powered tool for creating custom mini apps available as a Google Labs experiment. Starting today, the technology behind Opal is available directly in the Gemini web app.</p><p>It's an experimental Gem from Google that lets you build "reusable mini apps" and "unlock even more customized Gemini experiments," according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/mini-apps-opal-gemini-app-experiment/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. For those unfamiliar, Gems are custom AI chatbots that are experts at a specific task. You might use a Gem to take the role of a coach or a chess champion, for example. In this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gems</a> created with Opal in Gemini are mini apps with visual interfaces and complex functions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.28%;"><img id="xsrcTr4tG5qGZmoNMUtHsg" name="Google-Opal-Gemini-1" alt="Screenshots from Gemini's mini app builder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xsrcTr4tG5qGZmoNMUtHsg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1882" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opal debuted in July 2024 as a way to build AI mini apps by stringing together "actions" to create "workflows." It's a simplified version of app building that anyone can understand, and it supports text-based prompts, too. Unlike Google AI Studio or Google Antigravity, Opal is considered a "no-code" development platform that's accessible to everyone.</p><p>Opal is not-so-secretly powering the enhanced Gems in the Gemini web app. However,  the feature isn't being branded as Opal in the Gemini app. Instead, a new banner in the Gems tab reads: "Build AI apps, a new kind of Gem from Google Labs." This makes sense, because Google Opal doesn't have brand recognition among average Gemini users, since it's still only a Labs experiment.</p><p>To create a mini app Gem, users can pick a suggested prompt or type one in the text box. For guidance, the Gem creation chat window starts with "an app or workflow that..." to steer users in the right direction. You'll want to describe in detail what you want your AI mini app to do, and Gemini and Opal will try to make it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2494px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.70%;"><img id="b8Aas5DbqSo79Fh9J77PLh" name="Google-Opal-Gemini-" alt="Screenshots from Gemini's mini app builder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8Aas5DbqSo79Fh9J77PLh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2494" height="1888" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can view a miniaturized and collapsed version of Opal's visual editor in the sidebar after your app is created.

The feature allows users to start a chat in NotebookLM, close it, and pick up where they left off another time. Previously, NotebookLM notebooks would forget a conversation after each session ended, unlike Gemini, which supports Gemini and chat history.</p><p>NotebookLM is a research and study tool that can help you aggregate data and learn more about a topic. You can create Audio Overviews, Mind Maps, Reports, Flashcards, Video Overviews, Quizzes, Infographics, and Slide Decks based on source material. However, a simpler way to engage with NotebookLM is through the chat feature. It can answer questions about your topics using the context provided by your sources.</p><p>Now, chat history is available on NotebookLM's web client. Google says that chat history can be deleted at any time. You can delete a chat's history by opening the notebook and clicking the three-button menu. This will reveal a <strong>Delete chat history</strong> button, which you can use at any time to clear your data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.03%;"><img id="b4XeCxfWSKRHEAQDJVwKFD" name="NotebookLM-Chat-History-1" alt="Chat history in NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4XeCxfWSKRHEAQDJVwKFD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2470" height="1878" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For shared notebooks, Google reminds users that only you can see your chat history. All of your chat history is "retained and kept private to you." That is, until you manually delete it.</p><p>Previously, the only way to save your chats in NotebookLM was to save a response as a note. Below the NotebookLM chatbot's response, there is a <strong>Save to note</strong> button that will add the response as a note in your notebook. This method came with a few limitations — saved responses are view only, and don't include your written prompts. You can still save NotebookLM chat responses to notes, but now there's chat history available as an alternative.</p><p>There's a disclaimer in the Chat window in NotebookLM that explains chat history is only saved on the web, but mobile app support is coming "soon." This is typical for NotebookLM, as new features typically debut on the web before making their way to the mobile iOS and Android apps.</p><p>You can try NotebookLM's saved chat history on the web starting now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You're in luck, as the Chinese OEM announces the OnePlus 15R.</p><p>The OnePlus R-series typically sits under its flagship line; however, the company tries not to compromise on strength, and that's done by leaning on Qualcomm. In a press release, the OnePlus 15R features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>, a chip that adds flagship-level strength and performance to affordable phones, such as the OnePlus 15R. Alongside this chip, OnePlus states it's deployed a "triple-chip architecture plus OP Gaming Core.</p><p>This works to deliver "sustained high performance for gaming, multitasking, and intensive workloads." OnePlus highlights an almost 40% CPU performance boost between the 15R and its past generation, as well as an 11% boost in graphical performance.</p><p>To take the 15R's gaming capabilities to another level is a 360-degree Cryo Velocity Cooling System for intensive mobile gaming sessions.</p><p>While the works under the hood, what faces consumers will be a 6.8-inch AMOLED that can reach a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. OnePlus takes its eye care seriously with the budget phone, adding tools to help reduce user eye strain during longer use periods. Design-wise, the OnePlus 15R features a flat display, rounded corners, and a clean, minimalistic back panel, like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="VySaYBw3vqRFaeL8qrbwBn" name="oneplus-15r-plus-mind-camera" alt="A model holding up the OnePlus 15R, using its camera to take a photo of a "RUN" poster." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VySaYBw3vqRFaeL8qrbwBn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus says its latest affordable device isn't all about speedy multitasking and gaming, as its photographic capabilities shine, too.</p><p>Unlike the 13R, the OnePlus 15R features a dual-camera setup: a 50MP main sensor and an 8MP ultrawide. The company says that its budget-friendly phone still leans on its DetailMax Engine, which excels at capturing smaller details in photos. The OnePlus 15R is also capable of Ultra Clear Mode when shooting. The press release states this is activated automatically during the day and works to "double the resolution of your photos."</p><p>For selfies, the phone is equipped with a 32MP lens with strong focusing features. The device's recording function provides users with a crisp 4K resolution and extremely smooth 120fps.</p><p>Handling all of your daily functions and apps on the OnePlus 15R is a massive 7,400mAh battery. This battery outshines its flagship counterpart this year. More importantly, OnePlus states that this is its biggest battery it's ever made, which is estimated to have roughly 80% capacity remaining after four years of use. The device is paired with 55W SUPERVOOC charging.</p><h2 id="oxygenos-16-and-years-of-support-2">OxygenOS 16 and years of support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.74%;"><img id="c5xr9NRnnZDfnVPkJkHKCn" name="oneplus-15r-eye-comfort" alt="The OnePlus 15R in its black option in the hands of a model inside a vehicle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xr9NRnnZDfnVPkJkHKCn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="899" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus AI is a major part of its OxygenOS 16 software on the 15R. Much like the flagship variant, users will find an upgraded Plus Mind experience with AI Recorder and AI Writer. The latter helps to summarize lengthy articles and create "visual mind maps from your notes." AI Recorder's transcription capabilities for interviews are said to "distinguish between speakers" for a more consistent summary.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Plus Mind now looks to Google's Gemini</a> to help with weather forecasts and more, as the AI can dip into your saved Mind Space content for additional aid. OxygenOS 16 also retains its clean and smooth scrolling/interactions that you'd find on the company's flagship model.</p><p>OnePlus announces that the 15R will be supported with four years of OS upgrades, beginning with OxygenOS 16. This is strengthened by six years of security updates.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is available in two RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB. The device starts at $699, as pre-orders begin on December 17 at 8:30 am ET on oneplus.com. Those looking to pre-order the device through Amazon must wait until January 8. Users will find the OnePlus 15R in Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But that isn't all, it will also bring the ability for Meta AI to suggest a song on Spotify based on your vibe and what you're looking at in real-time. Neat eh?</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzqPxlYoyfU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Meta is rolling out the "Conversation focus" feature, teased earlier this year at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect</a>, exclusively to users who've signed up for the early access program for either the RayBan Meta or Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><p>So, if you're at a restaurant, on a subway, or even at a live music festival, this will ensure that the person you're speaking to is amplified. This "amplification" can be adjusted just like the volume, by swiping the right temple of your glasses, or via device settings, making it a breeze to adjust the volume levels based on the environment you're in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify icon on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4072" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the Spotify feature, Meta says it is the first ever "multimodal" AI music experience, which literally combines computer vision and recognition with Spotify's personalization suggest music, for instance, if you're looking at an album cover or are at a local Christmas market, you can just say "Hey Meta, play a song to match this view." This will prompt it to play tunes from Spotify based on your taste or even create a playlist for that moment.</p><p>That said, the conversation focus feature is currently only available in the U.S. and Canada. However, the Spotify AI music experience is available to early access users in Australia, Canada, India, the U.S., and several other countries. You can find the full list on their blog, and sign up for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ca/ai-glasses/early-access-program/">Early Access Program as well. </a></p> ]]></dc:content>

It did not take over the full screen and instead showed your wallpaper in a translucent view, with a pull-down swipe gesture at the top to quickly close the search screen.</p><p>However, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/16/pixel-launcher-search-google-app/">9to5Google</a>, Google has started replacing this with what it calls an "upgraded home screen search bar." This new search bar is actually the older Google Search UI powered by the Google app.</p><p>Now, when you tap the search bar on your Pixel's home screen, you're greeted with a new search interface that takes up the full screen and looks identical to the Google app's search UI. It's essentially the same experience you get on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a> when you tap the Google Search bar on the home screen.</p><h2 id="pixel-s-home-screen-search-now-opens-the-google-app-instead-2">Pixel's home screen search now opens the Google app instead</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HYvHhrFimNQCkTaSDnJJfT" name="google-pixel-launcher-search" alt="Old vs. New Pixel Launcher search UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYvHhrFimNQCkTaSDnJJfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Old vs. new Pixel Launcher search UI </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You still get access to app shortcuts, but you can no longer search for contacts or quickly access device settings like toggling Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from this screen. Because of this, it feels like a downgraded experience.</p><p>Google says this new search experience is part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Feature Drop</a> that rolled out recently for Pixel devices. The reason behind this change, as many would've guessed, is faster access to AI.</p><p>Google says the new search makes it easier to jump into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-search-live-conversations-in-ai-mode-are-now-more-fluid-and-expressive">AI Mode</a>. According to the company, it "lets you quickly start and resume AI Mode journeys, so you can dig deeper on the web. You'll also see more suggested apps in the top row, making it seamless to continue exploring on your device."</p><p>We're not sure how this qualifies as an upgraded experience, especially when it removes basic features like searching your phone's settings and contacts. But with Google pushing AI features with almost every update, we're not saying we didn't see this coming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The AI agent will display additional reminders that are important, but aren't time sensitive for that particular day, under an "FYI" listing. Additionally, CC dives into your Calendar to surface important events that day, including the time, location, and potential duration of the event.</p><p>Google states that what CC surfaces is what's "important to you," as it uses what you've set in Calendar, Drive, or received through Gmail. The personalization side of CC is through emailing. Users can email CC, telling the AI agent to add a new event. CC is said to do so accordingly by throwing that event into the Calendar if necessary.</p><h2 id="cc-google-s-ai-2">CC Google's AI</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mxixh5rNqn8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google says users who email CC with custom requests are "teaching it things" about them. Moreover, users can email CC to remember "ideas and todos." Creating an overview isn't everything the AI can do, as Google highlights its ability to prepare email drafts for your morning brief. Similar to events mentioned in the daily brief, CC will offer direct links to your Calendar events "to help you take action quickly."</p><p>If interested, Google says users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/cc">can sign up</a> for its CC waitlist via Labs. Early access starts today (Dec 16) for users 18 and older in the U.S. and Canada. However, Google AI Ultra and paid subscribers get in first.</p><p>Google Labs has been busy recently, as it also announced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-disco-experiment-is-an-ai-browser-that-turns-your-tabs-into-mini-apps">Disco</a>," an AI-fueled browser that can create mini apps from your tabs. The feature is called GenTabs, which takes information previously given by the AI and turns it into an interactive experience. If you're researching meals to build muscle or adhere to a specific health requirement, Disco's GenTabs can turn that into a comprehensive app that shows what meals to make on specific days.</p><p>Users can plan trips with Disco's GenTabs, which can create a map based on the location you're going to with pins about places to eat, visit, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you.

If this is something you might want or need, it's a great deal.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN" name="Roku-sports-experience.jpg" alt="Roku sports experience" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to stream media from the internet to your eyes, but most of them are extremely expensive, not so with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-vs-chromecast-google">streaming sticks</a>. These tiny gadgets plug into the HDMI port on a television and connect through Wi-Fi to stream all sorts of live TV, sports, and movies. Here's what's great about the Roku.</p><p><strong>It's cheap</strong>. You're going to waste $30 this week on something. If you give up a couple of lattes or cook at home one extra evening, you can buy this instead.</p><p><strong>It's easy</strong>. Roku's interface seems cluttered at first, I'm not going to lie. But if you take just a minute and zip through it, everything is categorized nicely, and there is no Google or Amazon changing everything on your home screen to infuriate you.</p><p><strong>It works with everything</strong>. It simply sends an audio and video signal through HDMI. That means it works on every TV made in the last 20 years, and even a computer monitor. As long as you can get an unfettered Wi-Fi connection (more on that further down the page), it just works.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1365px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH" name="tp-link-archer-wi-fi-7-announcement.jpg" alt="TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 router announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1365" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TP-Link)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is perfect, and there are some things to think about before you fork over your money. Everything works that way.</p><p><strong>It's not very powerful</strong>. I have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> and an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019-vs-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k">Amazon Fire TV</a>. One is really fast when scrolling through menus or getting a stream to start, while the other is ass. This Roku is right in the middle. It will show you what you want to see, but it might take an extra few seconds to get there.</p><p><strong>It's Wi-Fi only</strong>. We all have that spot in our home where the Wi-Fi isn't as fast as it is everywhere else. I happen to have a television in one of those spots, and because my Shield Pro can use Ethernet, it works fast. If I were forced to use Wi-Fi, I'd see some buffering, or the picture would suffer.</p><p><strong>It needs "open" Wi-Fi. </strong>No, not the public and unsafe kind of Wi-Fi, but a connection without a captive portal. Ever use Wi-Fi on a plane or in a hotel and have to start on a specific page or enter some sort of code? This isn;t going to work there. That's kinda bad because this gadget is the perfect price and size to carry with you on a business trip or vacation. There are workarounds, or you could tether from your phone's connection, though.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you buy the Roku Streaming Stick 4K?</p><p>If you want a cheap and easy way to stream videos and still get great video quality, the Roku is 4K (of course, it's in the name) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr10-and-why-does-it-make-galaxy-s10-screen-better">HDR10</a>. It will look as good as the screen it's attached to.</p><p>If you want Google or Amazon in the picture, so you can use apps or decent voice commands, pass on this one.</p><p>Finally, if you're looking for something to bring along on a business trip, check out the different ways to use a Roku with Hotel Wi-Fi and decide if you can live with them. if so, $30 gets you some entertainment instead of paying for PPV hotel movies.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6ddd924d-8741-4694-997c-455b80fa9255" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For just 30 bucks during Walmart's holiday sale, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K gives you instant access to all of your favorite streaming services with free live TV channels, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ support.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android fans are finally enjoying the convenience of magnetic wireless charging. Google officially added Qi2 support with built-in magnets to the Pixel 10 series via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, and Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-accessories-leak">rumored to do the same</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>.</p><p>When it's time to upgrade your phone, it'll also be a good idea to upgrade your wireless charger. There are a few first-party options from Google, but for the most part, Android users are looking to third-party accessory makers to fill the gap. Your next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2-supported wireless charger</a> might come from an unlikely brand: Ikea.</p><p>That's right — the Swedish home goods and furniture store that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ikea-launches-affordable-smart-sensors">also dabbles in smart home tech</a> now has a new lineup of official Qi2 chargers. The Ikea Västmärke is a donut-shaped Qi2 wireless charger with a few tricks up its sleeve. You shouldn't write it off as a gimmick, because it might be the best Qi2 charger for Android users on the market, and it's certainly the best value.</p><h2 id="wait-ikea-is-making-an-affordable-qi2-charger-2">Wait, Ikea is making an affordable Qi2 charger?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-3" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ikea's Västmärke wireless charger is available for just $10 in select stores, with delivery available as well. From a design standpoint, it's thicker than most other Qi2 wireless chargers. The product has a hybrid design, functioning as a portable wireless charging solution or a flat charging base for use on a desk or nightstand.</p><p>The donut shape is certainly striking, but it fits right in with Ikea's modern design language. It doesn't look like a tech product in the best way, complete with a "happy red color." There are no bland white, gray, or black color options that we're all too used to seeing in the tech space. It's available only in this intriguing circular shape and only in "happy" red.</p><p>The charging pad has a built-in cable that spans 47 inches, or just under four feet. It's a solid charging length that'll work for stationary desk setups but won't be too cumbersome on the go. The charging cable is made out of silicone. There's no power adapter in the box — you can use a 20W USB-C power adapter you already own or add one on from Ikea for an extra $4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-5" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's fully certified by the Wireless Power Consortium, supporting both the Qi2 Baseline Power Profile and Magnetic Power Profile. This means it'll work with older Qi devices without magnets, and it'll also support snap connection with newer Qi2 ones. Notably, Ikea's Västmärke supports Power Deliver 3.0 and Quick Charge 2.0.</p><p>In other words, the Ikea Västmärke is more than just a gimmick — it provides everything you might need from a Qi2 charger.</p><h2 id="ikea-s-charger-solves-a-few-problems-with-qi2-cables-2">Ikea's charger solves a few problems with Qi2 cables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-2" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wireless charging is somewhat controversial among tech enthusiasts due to a few of its downsides. It's less efficient, slower, and hotter than charging over a cable. However, I find it hard to build out a wireless charging ecosystem for a different reason. Wireless chargers are only useful if they're where you need them, and most of the Qi2 chargers on the market would look sorely out of place in a living room.</p><p>Ikea's Västmärke addresses the issue of wireless chargers blending in, and it does it while making a fashion statement. The bright red color and silicone exterior look great, but there's more to it than that. The Västmärke design serves a functional purpose, too. The 47-inch cable can be coiled and stashed within the donut-shaped charger for cleaner storage and peak portability.</p><p>What's more, the donut's silicone surface actually pops outward to reveal a phone grip. It's like having a built-in PopSocket in your wireless charger. That's helpful because any Qi2 wireless charger adds bulk to your phone, and Ikea's Västmärke lets you keep using it while charging.</p><h2 id="i-m-buying-this-donut-shaped-ikea-charger-immediately-2">I'm buying this donut-shaped Ikea charger immediately</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-1" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for the price, I probably wouldn't have given the Ikea Västmärke another look. But the official Google Pixelsnap Charger is $40 and is relatively uninteresting, save for the fact that it can charge <em>only</em> the Pixel 10 Pro XL at 25W speeds. Instead, I can get four Ikea Västmärke chargers for the same price to cover my home with wireless charging pads.</p><p>With the cable stashed away, this Qi2 wireless-charging "donut" looks more like a modern art piece than a charger.

I'm positive there are things I shouldn't do, so I'm asking you.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hiya Anon! And yes, at first this one was a pass for me, and I thought the question was a bit too simple. Then I got to thinking — I'm sure every one of us cleans their phone a different way, and I'll bet a lot of us do it the wrong way!</p><p>So, all in all, thanks for asking. The simple questions are often the most important.</p><p>I'm going to explain how I clean phones and tablets, but most importantly, I'm going to talk about what not to do. If it gets things clean without any sort of damage or wear, then it's the right way.</p><p>Every day I wipe the screen. I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Touchscreen-Microfiber-Cleaning-Solution-Fingerprint-Proof/dp/B0C8CKLSSF/" target="_blank">one of these little gadgets</a> (I love these things) for both the inside screen and front display of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a>. I have no idea what the fluid inside them is, but it works and is supposed to be guaranteed not to harm anything.</p><p>Speaking of fluids, <em><strong>never, ever</strong></em> use window cleaner or ammonia to clean your phone's screen. Both leave residue when they dry, and if even a single drop seeps inside your phone, it can be ruined. If you have a really bad spot (TMI: I once sneezed on my phone screen. Yuck!), use distilled water (not tap water or "drinking" water, distilled only!). Put a drop on your cleaning cloth and sort of scrub the mess away.</p><p>To be extra safe, when you're done (or if you sneezed on it), use a second cloth and some 90%+ Isopropyl alcohol all over the front, back, and sides. This kills germs and dries mostly streak-free.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="prMWfT5phMsX9raa2wnYuU" name="Google-Pixel-10-series-Pixelsnap-cases-3" alt="Pixel 10 and 10 Pro cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prMWfT5phMsX9raa2wnYuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2174" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it needs it (like every month or so), everything gets a proper cleaning. I shut the phone off and remove any case or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">doohickies</a> that may be attached. The case goes into the bathroom sink, and I wash it with warm, soapy water, then give it an alcohol rub. Set it aside and let it dry.</p><p>Next, I give the screen(s) a good cleaning as I described above. While I'm at it, I pay special attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera lenses</a> to make sure they don't have smudgy fingerprints or worse.</p><p>Then I want to clean the speaker and microphone holes, as well as the charging port. You can do this in several ways: use a soft-bristled <em><strong>dry</strong></em> toothbrush to go over them, use a wooden toothpick to flick out all the dirt and crusty stuff, or, what I think is best, use a chunk of BlueTak or Silly Putty. Just press it gently in place, count to five, then peel it — and the dirt — away.</p><p>Along the edge of the screen, I run a wooden toothpick along the tiny gap and weasel out any dirt that got in there next. When all this is done, I give the screen another wipe or two, then disinfect with some alcohol. Once the case is bone dry, I put it back on.</p><p>Done!</p><p>Notice I didn't mention things like ultrasonic jewelry cleaners or gadgets like the ones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phonesoap-pro-review">PhoneSoap</a> makes. I would never use an ultrasonic cleaner on a phone because that is a sure way to force liquid inside. Yeah, the liquid may be safe and dry without any residue, but I'd rather play it safe.</p><p>As for PhoneSoap and similar products, they should be safe to use for disinfection. I just like the cheap version of using alcohol. You need to wipe and clean your phone anyway, so it only takes a minute longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c3UEW7KfHH9rntjjC4KW9j" name="mud.jpg" alt="Mud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c3UEW7KfHH9rntjjC4KW9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lionsgate )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you <em><strong>can</strong></em> get things so dirty that you need to let someone who can open the phone take a look and clean it up. You probably shouldn't take your phone with you when you're doing something like mudbogging or riding in an airboat, but if you did and it got extra muddy or was dunked in muddy water, stop.</p><p>Turn your phone off right away, then take it to a repair shop. If you're the type that tears things apart yourself, take everything apart and hose it down thoroughly with <strong>CRC Quick Dry electronic cleaner</strong>; circuit boards, ribbon connectors, all of it. Give it an hour to dry completely, then try to put it back together. Good luck.</p><h2 id="jerry-s-big-list-of-things-to-never-do-2">Jerry's big list of things to never do</h2><ul><li><strong>Use ammonia or window cleaner on your phone screen.</strong></li><li><strong>Use bleach to clean or disinfect your phone.</strong></li><li><strong>Use compressed air to try to blow out the tiny holes and crevices.</strong></li><li><strong>Dunk your phone in any liquid, including water, to try to clean it.</strong></li><li><strong>Stick it in the dishwasher.</strong></li></ul><p>Any or all of these is a quick way to needing a new phone.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the app today in the Meta Instagram channel, stating that the company is "testing Instagram for TV — a new way to watch Reels on your TV." As you'd expect from this message, the app's TV presence focuses strongly on the platform's short-form content: Reels.</p><p>Amazon says the app is "organized into channels tuned to your interests." A few channels include sports, music videos, and trending topics. The app's main view showcases these Reels horizontally, including "For You" and "Popular with friends."</p><p>As it rolls out today, users will need to sign into their Instagram accounts on their Fire TVs. The press release states the app on Fire TV supports five accounts at a time, giving users the ability to switch between them. Instagram for TV features interactions similar to what you'd get on your phone. Amazon says users can quickly heart (like), drop reactions, and dive into the comments.</p><p>Consumers with a Fire TV Stick HD, Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> (1st and 2nd Gen), Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, or Fire TV Omni QLED Series can find the Instagram for TV app today (Dec 16).</p><h2 id="so-you-like-reels-2">So, you like Reels?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="DCWD3vXW4yXwZy5XVKtWKP" name="amazon-fire-tv-instagram-for-tv-reels" alt="Amazon introduces "Instagram for TV," a Fire TV app in collaboration with Meta that brings Reels to users on the big screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCWD3vXW4yXwZy5XVKtWKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1065" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no doubt that Reels on Instagram are always where the hype is at, and Meta knows this, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-is-trying-out-password-locked-reels-and-the-weeknd-is-first-to-test-it">why it continuously tests</a> new features for them. Earlier this year, Meta tested password-locked Reels for users. The first ones to take it for a test drive were The Weeknd, who showcased secret codes and hints for the locked Reels. It was marketed as a feature for creators to drive more engagement with the mystery of what's behind the lock.</p><p>Additionally, dropping exclusive content never became more, well, <em>exclusive</em>.</p><p>Most recently, Instagram announced a feature called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-hands-you-the-keys-to-control-your-algorithm-in-reels-plans-to-expand">Your Algorithm</a>." In short, the platform gave users in the U.S. the keys to control their Reels feed by telling the AI what they want to see and what they don't. Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, said that he envisioned a world where there was "transparency and control" with what users see on Instagram, and tuning the algorithm is a part of that.</p><p>Through this, users will see what the AI thinks they enjoy, with options to delete some supposed interests and add better ones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It often takes a while to truly understand the long-term health risks associated with something new. When social media became prevalent on smartphones and in schools, we didn't know how it would affect young people. Now, it's clear that social media use does negatively affect kids, with an advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General stating that "types of use and content children and adolescents are exposed to pose mental health concerns."</p><p>Although experts and regulators are beginning to acknowledge that social media use at a young age poses risks, no one can agree on what to do about it. Some countries, like Australia, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/is-youtube-bad-for-your-kids">enacting outright social media bans</a>. In the U.S., individual states and school districts are banning cell phones in schools while legislators mull what to do at the national level.</p><p>Bans might sound like an easy solution to a complicated problem, but teenagers are more optimistic about the future of technology and how it can be used for good, according to a Google-commissioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/future-report-teen-perspectives-europe-2025/" target="_blank">study</a>. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/build-the-internet-young-people-are-asking-for-instead-of-simply-banning-them-from-it/" target="_blank">analysis</a> by Jeffrey DeMarco, a senior technical advisor for Save The Children, sends a clear message: "the fix is not a blanket prohibition."</p><h2 id="what-the-research-study-found-2">What the research study found</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's study asked over 7,000 teenagers from across Europe what they want to get out of technology, and what they see as its future. Although the study was commissioned by Google, it was conducted separately by youth consultancy group <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://livity.co.uk" target="_blank">Livity</a>. It found that most teenagers already use social media and technology for learning. In the case of AI, students think they should be learning more about using it responsibly.</p><p>Australia's social media ban now covers YouTube, posing a problem for teens who have grown up using the platform for learning. The research study found that 74% of polled European teenagers have watched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> videos to learn something new for school. On a broader scale, nearly 84% of respondents said they watch educational or how-to videos at least a few times per week, and over a third say they watch these types of videos daily.</p><p>The study paints a picture of social media being a genuine learning tool for teenagers, and outright bans remove that element completely. "The point is not that feeds are not without their pitfalls and challenges, but that for the majority of teens, feeds are where they learn," writes DeMarco, the forensic psychologist who leads the Safer Digital Childhood program for Save The Children. "They are their classrooms, and they are asking for smarter, safer ones."</p><h2 id="pretending-social-media-and-ai-don-t-exist-won-t-help-anyone-2">Pretending social media and AI don't exist won't help anyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub" name="Gemini-3-1" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/is-youtube-bad-for-your-kids">Jerry Hildenbrand rightly points out</a>, kids are smarter than all of us. They'll thwart outright social media bans or restrictive measures without thoughtful guidance. I know because I was one of those kids not too long ago, bypassing my school network's internet blocklist with VPNs on a school-issued iPad (sorry, teachers). Young people will always find a workaround because they've grown up with technology, while the rest of us are forced to learn it.</p><p>If social media is banned and AI use is neglected in schools, kids risk being left behind. The research study revealed that 96% of older European teens used AI in the past year, and 40% of teenagers use it daily or almost daily. Young people are recognizing AI's value as a learning tool while also recognizing its risks. They'd rather see "clear, age-appropriate guardrails" instead of outright bans.</p><p>"That means spelling out what is OK, what is not, how to cite, how to verify," writes DeMarco. "That is what the teens are implicitly asking for, and the report’s recommendations explicitly call for through curriculum-level AI and media literacy, age-appropriate experiences and harmonized standards that preserve access to information while protecting younger users."</p><p>It's worth acknowledging that teens may be better at understanding the risks of AI and misinformation than adults. This particular study revealed that 55% of teens consider whether content is trustworthy, and 46% look for multiple sources for verification. Anecdotally, I've had to explain to my parents what "parody" accounts are on X and the realism of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-rolling-out-likeness-detection-for-creators">deepfakes</a>, but the younger people in my life are already tuned into the situation.</p><p>Another factor to consider is whether limiting social media and AI use among adolescents could hold them back in the future. In a November 2025 commentary by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2025/ec-202514-are-young-college-graduates-losing-their-edge-in-the-job-market" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland</a>, economic experts acknowledged "some of the long-standing job market advantages offered by having a college degree may be eroding." As artificial intelligence continues to impact the job market, recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals that young college graduates are having a harder time finding jobs than those with only a high school degree.</p><p>The commentary notes that there are "concerns about AI automation of entry-level positions traditionally filled by college graduates," underscoring the importance of AI education. Young people need to learn to harness AI as part of their secondary education to make thoughtful decisions about college and their careers.</p><h2 id="ban-predatory-practices-not-the-apps-themselves-2">Ban predatory practices, not the apps themselves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa" name="Instagram-hero-AC-2024.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether we're discussing social media use or AI use in schools, DeMarco's analysis of the research study argues "the real work is making those environments safer by default and raising the floor of digital literacy."</p><p>This study shows that young people are optimistic about technology, from social media to AI.

Grab the 512GB version of the phone from Best Buy and you'll score a straight $200 discount, or $300 if you activate through Verizon or AT&T.</p><p>If you want to save a little more, you can also buy the unlocked phone for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3"><strong>$749.99 at Amazon</strong></a>, but you'll be stuck with 256GB of onboard storage. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fbe148d4-4727-417e-a542-845d50f134ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Straight out of the box, the first thing you'll notice is the OnePlus 13's 6.8-inch OLED QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It's truly stunning to behold, and it helps that the OnePlus 13 is also the first phone to receive a DisplayMate A++ certification, meaning it'll work for folks with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>. </p><p>It's also one of the first devices to receive an IP69 water-and-dust resistance rating, which is why we harp on the dishwasher thing. It's just a huge relief to have a phone that you can accidentally drop into a puddle without causing any major issues. </p><p>The greatness of the OnePlus 13 doesn't just come from its looks, however. Under the hood you get the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, easily one of the fastest processors on the market, plus Oxygen OS 15 and 12GB of RAM. Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">the phone's camera tech</a> easily holds its own against the best devices from Samsung and Google, and the upgraded AI features are actually useful when taking pics or video. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NmES7DAjnQbcw5eobfrGYF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmES7DAjnQbcw5eobfrGYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5029" height="2833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's the catch? Well, no device is perfect, and it's true that the OnePlus 13 lags behind the competition when it comes to offline AI features. The phone also lacks Qi2 charging support, which was a welcome addition to both Samsung and Google's latest devices. </p><p>The six years of software support also falls (slightly) behind Samsung and Google's seven-year update promise. You'll still get security upgrades beyond that, but this could be a problem if you want to receive all the latest features beyond that timeline. If you're not in a rush and don't mind paying more, you also might want to wait until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> finally hits store shelves in late December/early January.</p><p>All things said and done, you have to get pretty nitpicky to find faults in the OnePlus 13. It really comes down to the experience you want. Are you super into AI features? Are you too accustomed to the Samsung or Pixel UI? Or do you simply want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone of 2025</a> at an incredible Black Friday price?

You might have Gemini open for brainstorming and quick answers, and NotebookLM in another tab for digging into your documents. This setup works, but switching back and forth can interrupt your focus. Now, Google seems to have released a feature that could help connect the two.</p><p>The company is said to be rolling out a direct integration that lets you pull your NotebookLM projects right into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> chat, according to @testingcatalog on X. The same source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-and-notebooklm-could-work-even-closer-together-in-a-future-update">spotted this change in November</a>.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING 🚨: Google is rolling out a NotebookLM integration for Gemini, where users will be able to attach notebooks as a context to their conversations.

Gemini is more of a creative generalist, offering broader reasoning but not focusing as much on your specific files.</p><h2 id="merging-two-ai-strengths-2">Merging two AI strengths</h2><p>Both tools are powerful, but keeping them separate made it hard to use Gemini’s advanced logic with your NotebookLM sources without extra steps. That is now apparently changing.</p><p>The update is surprisingly seamless. When attaching files to a prompt, some users are now seeing a NotebookLM option alongside the usual upload buttons. This shortcut lets you bring whole NotebookLM notebooks into a Gemini chat and ask questions based on the sources you have collected.</p><p>Rather than summarizing the open web or guessing what you mean, Gemini can now respond based on your PDFs, Google Docs, slides, and links stored in NotebookLM. This is important because NotebookLM was designed to help people make sense of large, messy sets of information while staying accurate.</p><p>Google hasn’t made a major announcement yet, and availability seems limited. Early reports suggest the feature is web-only for now and isn’t visible to everyone, even among paid Gemini users. This suggests Google is rolling it out gradually. Hopefully, it will be available on Gemini’s mobile version soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the executive, OnePlus is creating a new lineup that focuses on strong performance and long battery life.</p><p>The Turbo series will likely be just below <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus’ top flagship phones</a>, but should still offer strong features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Q44xMozHX" target="_blank">Early leaks</a> suggest these phones will use high-end chipsets, possibly including Snapdragon 8-series SoCs.</p><p>This strategy is similar to what OnePlus has done before with performance-focused phones. However, the Turbo name suggests a stronger and more consistent focus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:858px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.37%;"><img id="iZGt5nsgLcFYMhrdieH82f" name="OnePlus-Turbo-confirmation-Weibo" alt="OnePlus Turbo confirmation by Li Jie Louis on Weibo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZGt5nsgLcFYMhrdieH82f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="858" height="681" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Machine translation of a OnePlus executive's confirmation of a new phone series. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Li Jie Louis / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-oneplus-turbo-series-targets-a-specific-audience-2">The OnePlus Turbo series targets a specific audience</h2><p>Battery life may be a key feature for the Turbo series.

While OnePlus hasn’t confirmed exact specs yet, leaks hint at high-refresh-rate panels with resolutions around 1.5K.</p><p>The launch timing for the Turbo series is notable. Competition among performance-focused Android phones has increased, with many brands now promoting gaming phones or devices with long battery life.</p><p>Recently, OnePlus has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">gained momentum with its new flagship phones</a> and a closer connection to younger, performance-focused customers. The Turbo series seems to be a direct answer to this trend, offering a more focused option than a standard flagship without relying on gimmicks.</p><p>Pricing and global availability are still unknown, but the Turbo series is expected to launch first in China, possibly as soon as January 2026. Wider release plans will be decided later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Users can highlight any part of a book they're reading to get started with "Ask this book."</p><p>The elements the AI can respond to seem relatively wide-arching. The blog post states the AI can deliver details about the story's plot, character relationships, and thematic elements "without disrupting your reading flow."</p><p>Amazon adds that its generative AI software can answer questions about highlighted portions in a "spoiler-free" manner. It was stated that the AI responds quickly. When highlighting a section of a book, users will notice an "Ask" button in the hovering menu. From there, users can enter their query before being placed in a formal chat with the AI.</p><p>The post suggests using the pre-made queries if you're looking to get going even faster, as well as your personally crafted question. "Ask this book" is rolling out for iOS devices in the Kindle app for U.S. users; however, Android readers will have to wait until 2026. Joining this is "Recaps," a feature that lets Kindle and Kindle app users on iOS gain a refresher about their favorite series after the downtime between book releases.</p><h2 id="not-everyone-s-excited-to-dive-in-2">Not everyone's excited to dive in</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="DEKaWdYE9grGfCjLbvfr2Y" name="amazon-kindle-app-ask-this-book" alt="The Amazon Kindle app launches "Ask this book," a feature that lets users interact with its AI about story plots, character relationships, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DEKaWdYE9grGfCjLbvfr2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon's "Ask this book" has been making its rounds, and after the feature was highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2025/12/kindles-new-ask-this-book-uses-generative-ai-to-create-an-in-book-chatbot-without-permission-or-rights/">Publisher Lunch</a>, there's uncertainty behind its effects on rightsholders (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://writerbeware.blog/2025/12/12/kindles-new-gen-ai-powered-ask-this-book-feature-raises-rights-concerns/">Writer Beware</a>).

Beginning in February, Amazon started removing the availability of Kindle's download and backup to PC feature via USB transfer. It's been speculated that the move was to try to quell the DRM removal issue that's plagued its digital books.

It's great for watching movies or playing games, and is large enough so that you don't feel cramped when using split-windowed apps or working with a bunch of different apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-chromebook-plus" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one potential caveat with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and it has to do with the display. Unlike many of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/walmart-chromebook-deals-holidays-2025">best Chromebook options</a> out there, Samsung opted against offering a convertible design. As such, you'll need to look elsewhere if that's a key requirement for picking up a new Chromebook.</p><p>Even still, if the convertible design is not an absolute necessity, and you have the budget, then this is probably the Chromebook for you. And while it might not have the latest and greatest processor, there's still plenty of juice under the hood to handle much of what you can even think about throwing at it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="45YJPs2ZJszBfJawANLtHn" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus keyboard close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45YJPs2ZJszBfJawANLtHn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung and Google worked closely on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, as it was the first to feature a dedicated "Insert Key." This works in almost every app or browser window on your Chromebook. It also gives you quick access to basic things like an emoji picker, and of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>.</p><p>Speaking of which, if you do happen to snag the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, not only are you saving $150, but Google includes 12 months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/is-google-one-ai-premium-the-only-mobile-ai-suite-worth-paying-for">Google One AI Premium</a>. With this, you get 2TB of storage, access to the Gemini Advanced model, along with being able to make use of Gemini in your various Google apps.</p><p>With that in mind, you might want to move fairly quickly on this deal, as Christmas will be here before you know it. And as such, there's a pretty good chance you'll end up seeing the Galaxy Chromebook Plus return to its original retail price.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a press release, Motorola states that its latest G Power was built with speed in mind to keep up with your wild digital (and daily) life. Set for a January 8 market debut with a $299 price, the Moto G Power 2026 features a flat 6.8-inch FHD Plus display. Motorola builds on this with 120Hz refresh rate support and up to 1,000nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Another area Motorola sought to expand upon was the phone's durability. Specifications list 14 MIL-STD-810H resilience, capable of withstanding "drops, temperature extremes, and humidity." For the screen, Motorola leveraged Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, as well as an IP68 and IP69 rating for water protection.</p><p>Bringing the speed and reliability that Motorola claims the G Power is capable of is MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 SoC. It's worth mentioning that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">is the same chip</a> that empowered the G Power 2025 earlier this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-color" alt="Motorola G Power 2026 in a Cashmere color beside an iced coffee on a cream-colored table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Flip the G Power over to find its dual-camera array inside a square housing. The design is pretty similar to what Motorola brought with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">G Power 2025 edition</a>. Leading the duo is the main shooter: a 50MP lens with Quad Pixel Technology and OIS (optical image stabilization). In tandem, Moto states the device is capable of capturing your memories in greater detail. Flanking the 50MP is an 8MP ultrawide, macro vision lens combo.</p><p>The display houses the 32MP selfie camera. Motorola's photography-focused AI continues with Auto Night Vision, Auto Smile Capture, and Shot Optimization.</p><p>The AI features roll on with Google's involvement through Gemini and Circle to Search. Consumers will grab Android 16 with the Moto G Power 2026, alongside "Smart Connect." Motorola states Smart Connect lets users quickly transfer files and sync experiences. The company itself adds Moto Secure, Unplugged, Family Space, ThinkShield, and Hello UX.</p><h2 id="raise-a-brow-at-this-budget-phone-2">Raise a brow at this budget phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-evening-blue-options" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in its Cashmere and Evening Blue color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internal hardware specifications include a 5,200mAh battery that Motorola claims can sustain users for roughly two days. Battery Care helps users keep tabs on its health, as well as providing tracking support for optimized performance. Motorola combined this battery with 30W charging to deliver "hours of use" in a few minutes. The phone's 8GB of RAM helps with switching tabs and the demands of other key uses. The company highlights its AI-powered RAM Boost for up to 16GB of virtual RAM for "speed and responsiveness."</p><p>As previously stated, the Moto G Power 2026 will be available on January 8 for $299. The device is featured in two colors: PANTONE Pure Cashmere and PANTONE Evening Blue. Consumers can find the device on Best Buy, Amazon, and motorola.com when the time comes. Those in Canada can expect the phone to launch with a $449 price tag.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There’s now a new plus (+) button in the Search bar that does more than just handle keywords and nudges you into using generative AI.</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted Google to look at your document or photo and explain what’s inside, this update moves things closer to that. When you click the plus sign, a dropdown menu appears with two options: "Upload image" and "Upload file” (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/15/google-search-plus-menu/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>After you choose one of these options, you go straight into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a>. Here, Google’s generative models review your upload and give you summaries, explanations, or answers based on what’s in the file.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-direct-shortcut-to-ai-mode-2">It’s a direct shortcut to AI Mode</h2><p>This feature isn’t completely new. Google already allows file uploads in AI Mode. The main change is that it’s now easier to find. Google obviously wants people to see that Search is more than just typing questions.</p><p>For a long time, Google Search has focused on keywords. You type a question, Google searches the web, and you get links. That approach is still there, but now there’s more to it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.16%;"><img id="BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF" name="AI-Mode-plus-button" alt="AI Mode in search showing a plus button for uploading images and files" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1093" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past year, Google has been reshaping Search to feel more like a conversation than a list of links.

This is probably on purpose. Desktop users often upload PDFs, documents, or screenshots, so it’s a safer way for Google to see how people use this feature.</p><p>Here’s hoping this feature also comes to mobile next, where searching with your camera or images already feels normal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is wrapped in the company's Search Labs experimental environment. The Labs description for the feature reads, "make your Discover feed truly yours by saying what you want to see." It seems Google is fueling it with a heavy dose of AI to not only adhere to the user's request, but to hunt down that specific content.</p><p>Once you get down to it, "Tailor your Feed" is pretty receptive about what the user wants to see—and what it doesn't want to see, too.</p><p>There's a basic text box for the user to type their content preferences for the Google app's Discover feed. Once done, the fine print says "you'll be able to review before making changes." However, Google's early test shows that it's planning to offer a few suggestions, such as "stop showing me negative news." There were other suggestions listed, like "keep me updated on country music," which alludes to the AI briefly glancing over what's currently offered in your feed.</p><p>Once your prompt is in, "Tailor your feed" opens a chat thread with the AI. It will respond with the type of content you can "expect to see." Additionally, you can pile on more to really nail your ideal Discover feed. The post by 9to5 adds that you can even set the following content preferences: publishers, creators, formats, or "vibes."</p><h2 id="discover-more-2">Discover more</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-description" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" is a new Search Labs test that leans on the user's prompt to display content they want in the app's Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:263px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:228.14%;"><img id="k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-ai-chat" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" test will let users enter their own prompt, alongside a few suggestions for how their should tailor their Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="263" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While Google is slowly kicking off this experiment for users in the U.S., there was another test for the Discover feed earlier this year.</p><p>Google experimented with turning users' Discover feeds into a short podcast this year with its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-listen-to-your-discover-feed-with-daily-listen-experiment">Daily Listen</a>" test.

That said, I've been impressed by the latest Galaxy Buds, Pixel Buds, and AirPods models. Frankly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds for most users</a> are the ones that match their phone brand.</p><p>Of the bunch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> might be the most underrated. In terms of sound quality, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro can hang with the best. They're comfortable, with solid active noise-canceling and an excellent software suite. Although there are a few places where the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro could be improved, I'm not excited for the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 Pro.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Buds 4 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/leaked-galaxy-buds-4-icon-one-ui-8-5-another-new-look-for-samsung" target="_blank">first started leaking in October 2025</a>, and the leaks have continued at a rapid pace since then. Based on icons and graphics available in One UI 8.5 builds, we know that the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro will introduce a new design for the earbuds and case. However, it feels like Samsung is changing things for the sake of it. If that's the case, you should consider buying the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro now.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b8495d00-1434-464a-9685-2294521fc17e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" data-dimension48="The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro offer excellent sound and ANC, plus a striking design with LEDs on the stems.

It's not hard to figure out why. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were ridiculed by fans and haters alike for their appearance, which channel the AirPods Pro style in a very similar way. This model added stems for the first time and snap-attaching ear tips for the first time, similar to AirPods.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung executives were reportedly furious</a> that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro looked like a knockoff of the AirPods Pro. As a result, I'm not surprised at all that the company is set to make sweeping changes with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. I just didn't expect them to be this radical.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-leak-shows-a-slight-design-reboot">revealed in a One UI 8.5 animations leak</a>, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to have a revamped design with flatter stems, a different insertion angle, and a new mesh grill on the outside (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-look-3621013/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The triangular stems and their LED strips seem to be completely gone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-2.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Looking at the leaked Galaxy Buds 4 Pro renders, I'm prematurely mourning the loss of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I would've liked Samsung to improve the reliability of swipe gestures and pinch controls, which were too easy to accidentally trigger. I would've also welcomed sturdier ear tips and a refined connection system, as the current model's tips tend to tear when switched out often.</p><p>But a complete design overhaul? That feels excessive.</p><p>Considering the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were arguably my favorite earbuds until Bose released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> earbuds a few months ago, I'm worried the design changes could be for the worse. When it comes to headphone and earbud design, less is more. If it isn't broke, don't try to fix it.</p><p>It's a philosophy I'm all too familiar with, because Apple's revamped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a> design left me on the outside looking in. Although I've used AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 in the past, I simply don't find the newer model comfortable. That's the risk a company takes when it significantly changes the design of an audio product. What's frightening is that the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design changes look to be far greater than what Apple did with the AirPods Pro 3.</p><h2 id="samsung-might-revamp-the-galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-for-the-worse-2">Samsung might revamp the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro case for the worse </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-unboxing.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't stopping with just the earbuds — it's also rumored to be changing the case design as well. Instead of a tall charging case that the earbuds slide into vertically, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to use a flat, jewelry-style charging case. I'm not a fan of this earbud case style, as they're typically larger and harder to pocket than the alternative. I feel like the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro replacement could be a step backward.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-4-Pro-new-design" alt="new design and stem appearance of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="547" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The great thing I can say about the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro is that they're still expected to lean into what Samsung's audio gear does best — software. In addition to classic features like game mode and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Samsung Seamless Codec (SSC)</a> support, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to add a "Find Your Phone" button on the charging case.</p><p>This button would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-might-add-a-crucial-button-the-last-model-was-missing">let you ping your phone via Bluetooth</a> from the earbuds' case. The reverse could work, too, with a speaker grille on the charging case. This is clearly the bright spot of a rumored charging case design change.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-peak-samsung-earbuds-2">The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are peak Samsung earbuds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqcAtMQne48WELxTzwmK4U" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-IN-CASE.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqcAtMQne48WELxTzwmK4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's far too early to say whether the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro will be a hit.

Then you simply select the device you want to stream to and playback will begin. As with other Chromecast playback, you'll be able to control everything directly from your phone.</p><p>The feature is already rolling out starting today. We were able to use it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> with the latest version of the Apple TV app (version 2.2.0). If you don't see the Cast icon yet, just update the app through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv">Google Play Store</a>.</p><h2 id="casting-from-apple-tv-app-on-android-is-now-possible-2">Casting from Apple TV app on Android is now possible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr" name="apple-tv-google-cast-support" alt="Apple TV app with Chromecast support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple notes that this feature will make it easier for users to stream "award-winning" shows and movies like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Slow Horses</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>Pluribus</em>, and <em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Apple TV is slowly becoming a serious sports-streaming app with support for Major League Soccer, Friday Night Baseball, and Formula 1 races in the U.S. This expansion is great for users who don't own Apple devices but still want to stream content on the big screen.</p><p>The rollout comes at an interesting time.

It's only available in South Korea for now but global availability is expected to improve in 2026. The Z TriFold has similar dimensions as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when folded, but it opens up to reveal a massive 10-inch display.</p><p>The third folding portion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> has allowed Samsung to increase the battery capacity to 5,600mAh. It also supports Super-Fast Charging 2.0 at 45W which is said to deliver up to a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. The phone also supports 15W wireless charging and Samsung's Wireless PowerShare feature for reverse wireless charging. This is the fastest wired charging foldable from Samsung yet, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> tri-fold phone charges at 66W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a first attempt, we feel Samsung has done a splendid job and we can attest to this as our Senior Editor, Harish Jonnalagadda, went hands-on with it at Dubai Mall. The folding pattern is also different from Huawei's approach which has an accordion-style design while the Galaxy TriFold opens up like two flaps of a box. Samsung has armed the Galaxy Z TriFold with solid specs as it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 16GB of RAM, 512GB or 1TB of storage, and an IP48 rating.</p><p>The camera setup is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with a 200MP main sensor on the back. Noteably, the Galaxy Z TriFold only comes in one color called Crafted Black, with a Kevlar texture on the outside that looks pretty cool. When unfolded, the phone measures 3.9mm at its thinnest point. Because of the extra fold, the folded dimensions are much thicker than the z Fold 7 at 12.9mm. It's also a lot heavier at 309 grams.</p><p>Samsung is testing the waters with the Galaxy Z TriFold but it's already proving to be a huge hit. Despite the ~$2,430 price tag (when converted), the initial batch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-sold-out-like-hot-cakes-in-its-overseas-debut">reportedly sold out</a> in South Korea and it could prove to be a popular premium product in other markets too. It's no doubt one of the most unique <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> out there that many mobile productivity enthusiasts will be waiting to get their hands on in 2026.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fc89202f-1d11-4574-b79e-5cc19e6e2ed0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still great for the rest of us</strong></em></p><p>While all eyes are on the Galaxy Z TriFold right now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still one of the best foldables in the market that's easily available and more affordable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Any existing S Pens will not work on the folding phone's inner or outer displays. Samsung also dropped S Pen from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in 2025.</p></article></section><h2 id="s-pen-support-is-all-but-extinct-on-samsung-foldables-2">S Pen support is all but extinct on Samsung foldables </h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is official as of Dec. 1, 2025, and it's set to go on sale in South Korea on Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time. Some details are still up in the air, like U.S. pricing and availability. We know the Galaxy Z TriFold will come to the U.S. sometime in the first quarter of 2026, but we don't know how much it will cost or have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">official release date</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, Samsung did release a complete specs sheet for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and it sets the record straight on S Pen compatibility. No, the Galaxy Z TriFold will not support any S Pen model, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/specs/" target="_blank">official specs breakdown</a>. There's an "S Pen support" category on the Galaxy Z TriFold's product information page, and it clearly states S Pens are "not supported."</p><p>This isn't exactly surprising, but Galaxy fans may understandably be disappointed. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold has a 10-inch AMOLED inner screen that's larger than some tablets, and a first-party stylus would've been excellent for drawing and note-taking. However, styluses for folding phones are tricky to make. There's often no space for an internally-housed S Pen — like the Galaxy S25 Ultra uses — and their inner screens are still fragile enough that a pointy S Pen tip could cause damage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4814" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 pictured above, the Galaxy Z TriFold does not support the S Pen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Samsung removed S Pen support from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> earlier in 2025. This was another early signal that the company is moving away from styluses for foldable phones entirely, including the Galaxy Z TriFold. The move was made on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to make the display assembly, and the phone itself, thinner. Since the Galaxy Z TriFold is thicker and folds twice, it's likely that adding a digitizer for S Pen support would've made the phone too thick.</p><p>The last Galaxy foldable to support an official S Pen was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Fold Edition or S Pen Pro</a>. Newer models, including the Galaxy Z TriFold, have cut official stylus support entirely. You may be able to find third-party stylus options for the Galaxy Z TriFold, but these will lack the precision and integration of the official S Pen. You'll also have to make sure they won't damage the delicate Galaxy Z TriFold folding display.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will make its way to the U.S. in early 2026, but unfortunately, it won't be coming with the S Pen in tow.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="005e2b38-ebef-4f28-b7ef-db33cb34646f">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJKygHEi5oBmEN8fNhEH6a.jpg' alt="Product box image of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold features a 10-inch foldable AMOLED and a 6.5-inch cover screen, plus standalone DeX and usage as an external monitor for your PC.

The newer Watch 8 added a few improvements and upgrades, but the Watch 7 still holds up. It's especially competitive at this price point, being the lowest it's ever been and contrasting rivals with a lot of power and functionality.</p><p>This deal is for the 40mm version of the Watch 7, which includes a slightly smaller screen. For some, this is preferable to the 44mm for wearing while sleeping, and just being slightly less bulky overall.

These are great ways to kill time, but it's important to save battery life for crucial tasks, like making calls or using Google Maps for navigation. In a Pixel Drop, Google made it easier for users to get to their destination on low battery with the new Google Maps power saving mode.</p><p>Power saving mode in Google Maps is quite limited. It's not just restricted to Pixel phones. Instead, it's only available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">four Google Pixel 10 models</a>. If you happen to have one of the newest Pixel phones, you can extend your device's battery life with this feature. Here's everything you need to know about Google Maps power saving mode, and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">What you need to use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8E7n8GwffFMP3nGd4HU9kW" name="Google-Pixel-10-Lemongrass-2" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8E7n8GwffFMP3nGd4HU9kW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Pixel Drop</a>, Google added a power saving mode to Maps. It's exclusive to the four Pixel 10 models, namely the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google describes power saving mode as offering a "simple, low-power map" on your lock screen. It keeps necessary navigation information, like your next turn, easily visible on the screen. However, it cuts out a lot of the unnecessary visual elements, switching to a black-and-white UI to save power. Google says this can "significantly" extend your phone's battery life.</p><p>There are a few limitations in addition to the feature being a Pixel 10 exclusive. It'll only work while driving, and you can only use power saving mode in portrait orientation.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-and-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">How to enable and use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><p>To use Google Maps power saving mode, you'll need to enable the feature in the app's settings menu once. After that, the low-power battery view will be one button away for future navigation sessions. Here's how to enable, use, and disable Google Maps power saving mode:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Maps app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>Google Account picture</strong>.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Navigation</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8" name="Google-Maps-Power-Saving-Mode-1" alt="The screenshots for using Google Maps power saving mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>4.

Since the feature only supports driving mode, a press of the power button will not activate power saving mode for walking, biking, or transit navigation sessions.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">When to use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Maps has a lot of functionality, but its expansive feature set can drain your phone's battery life if you aren't careful. Now, you can turn off the unnecessary visual cues and features with one button thanks to Google Maps power saving mode. It's a toll every Google Pixel 10 owner should know about, as it might just help them get to their destination safely when their phone's battery is running on fumes.</p><p>Eventually, we're holding out hope Google Maps power saving mode might make its way to more Pixel models, and even other Android phones in the future. For now, it's yet another Google-exclusive perk for Pixel 10 users.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="91fece5e-a7c2-48fb-b1e0-254007a48bbb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMhL9mghoD6NWUtd7mbtEY.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Lemongrass"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Fully featured</strong></em></p><p>While we hope to see Google Maps power saving mode come to more devices in the future, for now, it's a Google Pixel 10 exclusive.

The phone further improved its AI processing capabilities while adding Qi2 and MagSafe for the first time. In fact, the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Qi2 25W for ultra-fast wireless charging. Now, it's up to Google's competitors to match this standard, starting with Samsung and the Galaxy S26 Plus.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus</a> is still unconfirmed, rumors and leaks are heating up ahead of an expected early 2026 launch.  The upcoming smartphone is expected to get the usual chip upgrade, minor camera improvements, and Qi2 magnets. However, the design and core experience is thought to be unchanged.</p><p>So, how will the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus compare to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review#">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>? Let's look at everything we know so far in this speculative comparison.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors and leaks paint a picture of indecision on Samsung's part as the launch of the Galaxy S26 series nears. The company originally planned to shake up the lineup by releasing a Galaxy S26 Pro instead of the base model and a Galaxy S26 Edge instead of the midsize option, according to early reports. However, it's looking like Samsung will keep things traditional with a Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra — at least to start.</p><p>Samsung usually releases its phones in January each year, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">an October leak</a> claimed the Galaxy S26 lineup was delayed until March. More recently, rumors split the middle, with Samsung now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">expected to release the Galaxy S26 Plus</a> in late February 2026. It'll likely be priced at the same $999 starting price with options for 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is available now as the brand's top non-folding flagship. The phone retails for $1,199 for the base model with 256GB of storage, and it can be configured with up to 1TB. It's available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, and Obsidian colorways.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Ya5KdRnBMqYw367nvvoxME" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ya5KdRnBMqYw367nvvoxME.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're expecting slight design changes for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus, but the rumored differences simply align the smartphone with design languages of phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy Z Fold 7. Instead of having separated rear camera lenses like the Galaxy S25 Plus, the Galaxy S26 Plus will have a pill-shaped camera island that the three cameras will sit atop of. This is the biggest design change for the Galaxy S26 Plus, and it's a relatively minor one.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy S26 Plus will still sport a rectangular and boxy chassis with flat aluminum side rails. It's still a glass sandwich, with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 securing the front and back of the phone. For durability, Samsung is expected to round out the experience with IP68 certification against dust and water ingress, which has been standard for a while now.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-pixel-10-pro-xl-porcelain-backs" alt="The backs of the porcelain Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro standing next to each other on a bench" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone brands usually find a way to upgrade the display on their devices annually, whether it's a slight size increase, smaller bezels, or higher brightness.

That means you'll get a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution.</p><p>If the current generation is any indication, we can expect 120Hz adaptive refresh rates, ProScaler for QHD+, and at least 2,600 nits of brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M3ZfEQpfnKQ8VM6YGGgkpZ" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-welcome-setup-01" alt="The welcome screen of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3ZfEQpfnKQ8VM6YGGgkpZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL is slightly larger, measuring 6.8 inches with a 1344 x 2992 resolution. It's also an AMOLED panel with 120Hz variable refresh rates. Google does have the advantage of a brighter, 3,300-nit display. The Pixel 10 Pro XL also includes an accessibility setting for PWM-sensitive people, but this only doubles the standard PWM rate, and might not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>From a design standpoint, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is just as boxy as the upcoming Galaxy S26 Plus. However, it has a horizontal pill-shaped camera island near the top of the phone. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is expected to be much thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S26 Plus, with the Pixel camera bar protruding even further.</p><p>Google does offer IP68 protection and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. Additionally, it crams Qi2 25W magnets inside the Pixel 10 Pro XL. While the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus looks like it'll include Qi2 magnets, these might utilize the 15W standard.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus is expected to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, at least in some regions. Samsung might use a dual-chip strategy, shipping the phone with an Exynos processor in other markets. Surprisingly, it looks like Samsung will still opt to pair these chips with only 12GB of memory.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro XL ships with a weaker Tensor G5 chip, but it's paired with a higher 16GB of RAM. Google Tensor chips already excel at AI processing, and the additional memory will only expand the use cases for the Pixel 10 Pro XL's on-device AI support. Additionally, the extra RAM could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL support future features that will be added throughout the phone's seven-year software support window.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus (Rumored / Expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm (6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8mm x 76.6mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and back), Aluminum frame</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front-and back, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1440x3120 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua OLED, 1344 x 2992, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz, 3,300 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (for Galaxy)</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Compass, and Barometer</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Ambient light sensor Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Magnetometer, and Barometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, UWB, and USB-C 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v6, NFC, Dual-band GPS, 5G mmWave (NA only), 5G Sub-6, LTE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung DeX (wired & wireless), Galaxy AI</p></td><td  ><p>Titan M2 chip, Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, single-camera face unlock, Google VPN</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh (Si/C), 45W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, Full Qi2 Support</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh, 45W wired, 25W Qi2.2 Pixelsnap wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom), 12MP ultrawide, 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 48MP 123-degree ultrawide with macro focus, 48MP 5x telephoto, 4K/60 10-bit HDR on all cameras, 8K/30 on rear cameras</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide-angle | 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>42MP 103-degree Dual PD AF selfie | 4K video recording </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8.5 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a newer camera assortment, with a 50MP primary shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with up to 5x optical zoom.

However, it could be doing more, and the overall design and feel might come off as stale to longtime Galaxy fans.</p><p>Google is heading in a different direction. Compare the Galaxy S26 Plus to the Galaxy S23 Plus, and you won't find major differences. Do the same for the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 7 Pro and it's wildly different. Google exudes polish with its recent flagships, even if they're a bit thicker and heavier than I'd like. We can't fault anyone for going with the Pixel 10 Pro XL today as a result, but there's also a case for waiting for the cheaper Galaxy S26 Plus.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d36bc90e-c841-4def-80c9-f2fced7d482c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus might not offer a full revamp for Galaxy users, but there are still upgrades worth waiting for.

The latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is rolling out now for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and for Gemini Live and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed">Search Live</a> users.</p><p>The changes will make it easier to converse with Gemini while chatting live, and can improve the quality of Google's Live Voice Agents. Specifically, new Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model improves multi-turn conversation quality. When you chat with Gemini Live across multiple turns, it'll remember context from old turns. The extra context helps create "more cohesive conversations," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-audio-model-updates/" target="_blank">according to Google</a>.</p><p>The model is also better at interacting with external workflows without impacting the smoothness of your conversation. It can pick up on your audial cues to figure out when to access these outside functions. These external workflows can provide real-time information that Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio can subsequently insert into its audio responses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5eA5aZpVYbs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gemini's Live Voice Agent is also better at understanding and acting upon complex instructions from a user. Google says these upgrades result in "higher user satisfaction on content completeness." In other words, when interacting with a Live Voice Agent powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25, you may not need to demand to speak to a human representative. The artificial intelligence model might be able to handle more multi-step tasks on its own.</p><p>It's more reliable overall, with a 90% adherence rate to developer instructions. That's an increase of six percent compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-models-deep-think-flash-updates">older Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio</a> 9-25 model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ" name="gemini-audio_blog_light_blue_16x9_v1_25-12-12" alt="The improvements made to Gemini 2.5 Flash native audio." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the ComplexFuncBench Audio benchmark, the latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model beats both its predecessor and OpenAI's gpt-realtime model with a score of 71.5%.</p><p>The upgraded Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, as well as Live Voice Agents, are available now in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

While Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses aren't a prototype, they are positioned for early adopters, and we expect the company to continue expanding their capabilities over time. Ahead of 2026, Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth is previewing what's next for Ray-Ban Display glasses, and the future looks bright.</p><p>The core <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> experience is powered by the Meta Neural Band. It's an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-leaked-smartwatch-with-brain-signal-tech-would-be-perfect-match">included wristband with EMG technology</a> that can map thousands of motor neurons and associate them with gestures. At launch, Ray-Ban Display supported the Neural Band for things like clicks, scrolls, and dials. However, that's just the start, as Bosworth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/boz-2025-look-back-2026-look-ahead/" target="_blank">confirms</a> the EMG band "can become capable of recognizing increasingly complex inputs as time goes on."</p><p>Meta says that EMG handwriting is coming "soon" for Ray-Ban Display and Neural Band users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="g3Vh8vkJTAXzRQq28ATTAn" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-sEMG-band" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, holding his wrist with the Meta sEMG band close to the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g3Vh8vkJTAXzRQq28ATTAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Soon we’ll roll out EMG handwriting — dozens of new neural signals that allow the band to reliably recognize every letter of the alphabet," Bosworth explains. "The more data we gather, the more capable it becomes."</p><div><blockquote><p>This is a foundational shift in how humans will interact with computers.</p><p>Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO</p></blockquote></div><p>Early access for EMG handwriting is set to arrive next month, with wider availability to follow. The feature could make it possible for Ray-Ban Display users to type and communicate with their smart glasses by simply drawing or gesturing on a flat surface while wearing the Meta Neural Band.</p><p>That's not all Meta has in store for Ray-Ban Display users, though. Owners are clamoring for a way to watch videos on the monocular display glasses, and in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@boztank/post/DSIq5gCFi64?xmt=AQF0rFyurSfEVTx-DO4J4vTwOICh2B1mUmrA3szVsde-Zw" target="_blank">a series of Threads comments</a>, Bosworth confirmed something is in the works. Support for Instagram Reels undergoes internal testing at Meta this month. Then, it'll roll out "in a couple of months."</p><p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Display glasses cost $799</a>, and while that includes a custom-fitted Neural Band, it's an expensive early-adopter product. The monocular display (meaning there's only a screen in one lens) and limited prescription support further narrows down the glasses' niche. With that being said, it's looking like 2026 will bring exciting new features to the smart glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If a photo had multiple objects or details, you had to rely on carefully worded prompts and hope Gemini focused on the right thing.</p><p>That approach worked sometimes, but it often felt like talking past the AI. The new markup tools aim to fill that gap by letting you guide Gemini visually rather than verbally (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-markup-tools-3625092/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Once the feature is live for you, attaching an image in Gemini displays a brief note about a markup interface. From there, you can sketch directly onto the image or add text annotations. For example, you can circle an object, draw an arrow, highlight a section, or write a note. Gemini will use these markings as context when handling your request.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Real-world usage is still a mixed bag.

The markup feature brings these abilities together in a way that feels more natural for users.</p><p>Right now, availability seems to be limited, and Google hasn't formally announced it yet. This appears to be a server-side rollout, so even users with the latest Gemini app may not see it yet.

It made it possible to have a back-and-forth conversation with AI while using Google Search. If you're familiar with Gemini Live, Search Live is similar, but its goal is to connect you with links and sites on the web. Now, it's becoming conversational thanks to a native audio model update.</p><p>The refresh brings responses that are "more fluid and expressive" to Search Live users. Powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-flash-native-audio-model">Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model</a>, the Search Live is more dynamic, adjusting its voice speed, tone, and style based on your preferences. Google announced the upgrade in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/live-audio-gemini-model-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, saying that Search Live users can now "enjoy smoother, more natural conversations."</p><p>Search Live's enhanced conversational understanding lets you customize how your AI's voice sounds on the fly. In the example <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKyxgKSz3A" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> below, Google shows off Search Live answering a question about a rock, leveraging the live video feed and internet sources.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kKyxgKSz3A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In this example, Search Live responds with a fast-talking, bright, and enthusiastic voice. Then, the user asks Search Live to talk slower so their child can understand, and the voice immediately becomes deeper and more authoritative. It also speaks in a slower pace with more emphasis on enunciation in the delivery, so a young child can understand.</p><p>These changes happen in real time with no delay. They're specific to your current Search Live conversation, so you can ask for a custom speaking style every time you go live with AI Mode.</p><p>The upgrades come from the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> native audio model, which is also rolling out in Gemini Live, and is available for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><h2 id="when-you-can-try-search-live-s-smoother-conversations-2">When you can try Search Live's smoother conversations</h2><p>Search Live's upgraded conversations are rolling out for all U.S. users. The rollout began Dec. 12 and will continue over the course of this week. You can find it in the Google app for iOS and Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature, known as Motion Cues, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-could-steal-a-crucial-ios-18-feature-that-helps-curb-motion-sickness">discovered way back in 2024</a>. While the tool appears to be fully functional in Google Play Service, we're still waiting for a public release. Now, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-motion-cues-rumor-3624642/" target="_blank">Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman</a> reveals that Motion Could debut within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a> — and the reason why it's taking so long.</p><p>Like Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues, Google's version overlays motion dots to give the user signals as to which direction the vehicle is moving. This could allow people suffering from motion sickness to use their Android phone while riding in car. However, as currently built, Motion Cues can only display over other apps — not system elements.</p><p>As Android Authority discovered, Android's motion dots do not appear over the Settings app, status bar, notifications, Quick Settings, lock screen, or volume panel. The report explains that Android's default overlay API prevents the feature from working in these areas as a safety feature. The security restriction hampers Motion Cues' ability to create an immersive overlay of your vehicle's movement, as it can be interrupted by various system elements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9" name="Motion-Cues-Android-Authority" alt="The Motion Assist feature in Android 17." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's solution to this problem could be to introduce a new Motion Cues API, per the report. There are signs in Android Canary's 2512 build that an upcoming Motion Cues API could use SystemUI for the rendering of motion dots. As the SystemUI app is responsible for handling system elements, the new API and integrations could solve the problems with Motion Cues in its current, unreleased form.</p><p>In a future update, Motion Cues could leverage both Google Play Services and SystemUI. The former might handle the location and appearance of Motion Cues, and SystemUI could be tasked with displaying them.</p><p>However, a new system API cannot be added with a Google Play Services update or a server-side push. Instead, new APIs are added through full operating system updates, like a quarterly Android release or a complete version update. As such, the earliest Motion Cues is likely to debut is alongside Android 16 QPR3, but Android 17 is starting to look most likely.</p><p>Motion Cues would be Android's answer to Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues. To differentiate the feature, Google could brand the finished product as Motion Assist. This name would fit nicely with other Google features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist">Pixel's Call Assist</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company also has a specialized messaging client for Workspace teams called Google Chat, though. Starting this week, Google is making two key changes to Chat that'll make the platform quicker and add a long-overdue messaging feature. These changes arrive as part of an extended rollout, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/12/a-new-web-address-for-google-chat.html" target="_blank">according to Google</a>, meaning they might take a few weeks to show up for everyone.</p><p>You might not know that the old web URL for Google Chat doesn't follow the typical Google format. Google Chat was originally found on the web at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://mail.google.com/chat" target="_blank">mail.google.com/chat</a>, and it's now moving to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://chat.google.com/" target="_blank">chat.google.com</a>. The small tweak might break some Google Chat extensions, so be sure to update your extensions to be compatible with the new URL.</p><p>Aside from the URL change giving Google Chat an online home separate from Gmail, the shift brings a big improvement for users. Google says the fresh URL reduces loading time, allowing Google Chat's web client to run faster. Crucially, it doesn't affect the Chat user interface, and bookmarks and links to the old URL will still work.</p><p>Separately, Google is adding a schedule send feature to Chat that works similarly to scheduling an email in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a>. When creating a message in a Chat conversation, you can click the menu beside the send button to open the schedule. From there, you can pick a suggested schedule send time or choose a custom time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T" name="Clicking on the down arrow next to the Sent button brings up the Schedule send menu" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-chat">Google Chat</a> will now display a banner above the compose box when you have a scheduled message in a particular conversations.

This new area will let Chat users edit, reschedule, or cancel messages.</p><p>Notably, you'll only see a Drafts page in the sidebar when you have active scheduled messages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T" name="New Drafts shortcut to edit, reschedule, send, and delete your scheduled messages" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the new Google Chat URL and schedule send support are rolling out now for Workspace users on rapid release domains.

The new software version for Samsung smartphones brings features like a redesigned Quick Settings panel, updates to Quick Share, the ability to see all your files across all your devices, redesigned app icons, and more.</p><p>One of the new Galaxy AI features debuting with One UI 8.5 is the upgraded Photo Assist in the Gallery app, which allows you to apply AI edits to images without saving each iteration. It, however, appears Samsung is hiding even more Galaxy AI features within the build.</p><h2 id="ai-notification-summaries-may-remain-exclusive-to-galaxy-s26-at-first-2">AI notification summaries may remain exclusive to Galaxy S26 at first</h2><p>According to reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1999404746608939214">@chunvn8888 on X</a>, "lots" of One UI 8.5 features are not available right now because Samsung is keeping them exclusive to the Galaxy S26 series at launch.</p><p>One of the features the leaker mentions is the AI notification summary feature. This tool is reportedly part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-smarter-notifications-one-ui-8-5-beta">One UI 8.5</a> but currently disabled. It will use Samsung's in-house Gauss model to provide users with a summary of their notifications from the past 24 hours.</p><p>The leaker adds that the feature will support several languages at launch including English, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, simplified Chinese (中国大陆), Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Thai.</p><p>The feature will likely remain exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> at first, with Samsung eventually rolling it out to other Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and more later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS" name="Google Pixel AI Summaries" alt="Google Pixel AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this feature sounds familiar, that's because it is.

This week, the entertainment giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming that Google’s AI tools have used Disney’s copyrighted material on a "massive scale" to train their models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/" target="_blank">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>Disney claims that Google’s AI models have been trained on and are producing unauthorized images and videos featuring popular Disney characters such as those from Frozen, The Lion King, Moana, The Little Mermaid, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, and others.</p><p>The company’s legal team also said that some of these AI-generated outputs include Google’s logo, which could make people think the content is officially approved by Disney.</p><p>Disney explained that it has raised these concerns with Google for months, but, as discussions did not resolve the issue, it decided to issue a formal legal warning to stop the alleged misuse of its intellectual property.</p><h2 id="google-begins-the-cleanup-2">Google begins the cleanup</h2><p>After receiving the notice, Google began working with Disney to take down dozens of AI-generated videos that featured popular characters, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/google-takes-down-disney-ai-videos-cease-desist-1236647823/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reports.</p><p>The search giant maintains that it uses "public data from the open web" to train its models. A Google spokesperson emphasized their "longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney," pointing to tools they’ve built, such as Content ID, that help rights holders manage their work.</p><p>AI systems are usually trained on large amounts of data collected from the public web, which can include copyrighted material. This practice often goes unnoticed until well-known characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Elsa, appear in AI-generated content without permission.</p><p>However, Disney is not turning away from AI altogether.
