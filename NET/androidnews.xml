<ul><li>Google announced increased safety measures that will roll out soon to its Play Store.</li><li>In an attempt to create a safer Android Ecosystem, Google will expand Play Protect to “target malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</li><li>It will start adding more verified badges to help users identify and validate genuine apps — “Verified” for VPNs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/keeping-google-play-safe.html"> announced today </a>that it will be extensively working on making its Play Store a safer platform for both app developers as well as users. In a lengthy Android Developers' blog post, the company chalked out protection plans for 2025 that will make it easier for developers to build safe apps right from the get-go, which will help users recognize "real" apps from fraudulent ones.</p><p>To start, Google Play Protect, which has its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/new-real-time-protections-on-Android.html" target="_blank">live threat detection</a> in place, is  expanding its protection to target more "malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</p><p>Recently, the Google Play Store was impacted by a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> massive ad fraud</a> that made users download "vapor apps" disguised as genuine popular apps. These ran recurring ads, making it difficult for users to delete and generating tons of revenue for fraudsters. After that, Google had to take down 180 apps from the platform.</p><p>Google started warning users when it detected an unsafe app that originated from sources outside of Google Play. The tech giant will also be expanding its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/02/piloting-new-ways-to-protect-Android-users-from%20financial-fraud.html" target="_blank">financial fraud protection pilot</a> to additional countries where it has seen "higher levels of malware-based financial fraud."</p><p>The blog further adds that the company's most recent analysis found over "50 times more Android malware" from sources outside the Play Store like internet browsers and messaging apps, likely from users clicking on scam texts or links.</p>

<p>"This year we’re working on ways to make it even harder for malicious actors to hide or trick users into harmful installs, which will not only protect your business from fraud but also help users download your apps with confidence," the blog stated.</p><p>Furthermore, the company is going to add a "verified badge" on specific VPN apps to help users discover more secure VPNs and will expand this to other app categories in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN" name="Google-Play-Protection" alt="Stats of developers using Play Integrity APIs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Developers Blog)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>App developers will also see tools to help protect their apps/businesses from fraud. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity" target="_blank">Play Integrity API</a> tool, which helps keep fraud, bots, cheating, and data theft at bay, will see “stronger protection for even more users” that will help them "re-identify abusive and risky devices in a way that also preserves user privacy." Google is also working on self-help tools that allow users to solve issues "for when they're using a tampered version of the app." These features will be rolled out to developers as early as May.</p><p>Lastly, Google is leaning in on the importance of feedback from developers through new features in Console and Android Studio. The Google Play Developer Help Community will also include more languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese, catering to a wider audience.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out publicly through a Google Play Store update now.</li><li>The update, which could take weeks to appear for everyone, doesn't seem to have any new features.</li><li>An APK teardown of the update hints at Gemini features coming to Android Auto screens soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto 14.0 is beginning to roll out to users as an update in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a>, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/android-auto-14-0-update-gemini-preparation/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Although the Android Auto 14.0 update does not appear to include any new features or behavior changes, there are a few signs included within that hint at Gemini soon replacing Google Assistant.</p><p>This shouldn't come as a huge shock, since Google revealed earlier this month that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini would officially replace Assistant on most devices</a> by the end of 2025. There are already hints that Gemini could eventually reach Google TV, Android Auto, and Nest hardware. Now that Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out, there are more code strings that preview how Gemini could take over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> screens.</p><p>One prompt in particular, hidden in the Android Auto 14.0 APK, reads "Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car."</p><p>9to5Google also revealed the following code strings in Android Auto 14.0 that hint at future Gemini features, prompts, and survey questions:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name=”assistant_education_tooltip_gemini_upgrade”>Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car</string>
<string name=”assistant_summarization_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was the message summary content?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_gemini”>How satisfied were you with Gemini in Android Auto today?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_voice_subjourney”>What was your primary goal for using voice interaction in Android Auto today? Select the task that had the biggest impact on your satisfaction.</string>
<string name=”gemini_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was your Gemini experience?</string></code></pre>
<p>Aside from the code strings, there are also various images for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Gemini Live included in the Android Auto 14.0 update. However, these strings aren't live, so don't expect to use them after updating to the latest version of Android Auto. At the time of publishing, you can't use Gemini in Android Auto just yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd" name="Android-Auto-Mercedes-Waze-map.jpg" alt="Android Auto running split-screen with Waze in Mercedes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it appears that Google is gearing up to make the big switch from Assistant to Gemini on Android Auto soon. We've already seen that Gemini features can be manually enabled, and the latest image assets and code strings in Android Auto 14.0 are yet another sign that the transition could occur imminently.</p><p>It's unclear when exactly the Gemini experience will become available for Android Auto users.</p>

<ul><li>An APK teardown reveals that Google could be working on letting you upload up to ten images onto Gemini.</li><li>As of now, users can only upload one image and additional images get replaced with the one that has been uploaded onto the chatbot.</li><li>This feature showed up on the beta version of the Google app v16.11.32.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been making several improvements to Gemini's capabilities, bringing more features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gems, Gemini Live and screen recording </a>to the free tier. However, the most basic ability to upload multiple images on to the AI chatbot seems to be missing—but this could change soon.</p><p>An<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-multi-image-upload-apk-teardown-3538149/"> APK teardown</a> performed by folks at Android Authority via Assemble Debug seems to have revealed a hidden feature that allows users to upload multiple images with a limit of 10 pictures at once.</p><p>Currently, users can upload only one image per prompt. If they try to upload more images, Gemini will ask if they'd like to replace the already uploaded file with a new one. This limits the user's need to give Gemini more information to get an all-around analysis of several images in one go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JKQM9qqFLeyoVqeJXhaV5A" name="Gemini-multi-image-upload" alt="Gemini APK teardown shows multi-image feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKQM9qqFLeyoVqeJXhaV5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication added that, with the Google app <em><strong>v16.11.32 beta</strong></em>, they were able to activate the ability to upload multiple images for analysis in the Gemini app. They assume that this feature was already tested and made functional for users but has been hidden for the masses to be released through an update in the future.</p><p>Once this feature was enabled during the teardown, they were able to attach up to 10 images onto Gemini's app within a single prompt, and Gemini was able to analyze all the images in one go, describing what those images contained. This feature would significantly reduce the time it takes for users to upload one image in each prompt and then wait to upload the next for the chatbot to interpret, as seen in the screenshot above.</p><p>While we don't know if and when this feature will roll out to users on a larger scale. However, since it seems pretty functional, this rollout could happen in the near future.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has just released its most advanced AI model — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in"> </a>starting today to its Gemini Advanced subscribers. The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models, moving to enable complex problem-solving abilities and serve as context-aware AI agents</p>

<p>Trade in an old or broken device at Samsung and you'll get up to $500 off the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> ever made. Don't have anything to trade in? Skip that process altogether and you'll still be guaranteed to receive a $150 discount, the exact same price drop that you can find at Amazon right now. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-256gb-moonstone-gray-wi-fi-sm-x820nzaaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="252a65a8-548f-43ae-80f1-b61a67f400c5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is all about balance, coming complete with a gorgeous 12.4-inch 120Hz display, powerful MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ with 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> software features. The versatile device also comes with an S Pen stylus, 4K UHD video recording, and outstanding battery life that could rival any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> in the biz. </p><p>Even if you skip the trade-in process, I&apos;d still recommend buying the tablet at Samsung so you can take advantage of those free subscriptions — it&apos;s over $150 of free stuff, none of which is currently being offered by Amazon. You can also pair the purchase of the tablet with the Galaxy Watch 7 to save 38% on the watch, or grab an accompanying keyboard book cover to get 50% off.</p><p>Needless to say, there are a ton of money-saving opportunities all over the web this week, but before you buy that Galaxy device from Amazon, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Samsung&apos;s deal page</strong></a> to make sure you aren&apos;t missing anything special. </p>

<hr>
<p>The anticipation for One UI 7 continues as Samsung is spotted rolling out another beta update for its foldables.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904429676430553536">Tarun Vats on X</a> posted a snapshot of Samsung's One UI 7 Beta 3 patch rolling out for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-3-update/">SamMobile</a>). The post states the update was initially rolling out for enrolled testers in South Korea, but the publication claims it's been spotted on "international variants," too. Interestingly, Beta 3 brings the April security patch to the foldables.</p><p>Marked as version ZYCG, the tipster states the update is roughly 1.2GB in size.</p><p>The publication provided a look at its changelog for English users, which shows "new features" for the foldables, like the ability to "press and hold the side button to launch the digital assistant." The devices gain call recording summaries (in text), webpage summaries, and natural-language search in Settings.</p><p>A couple of larger Galaxy AI features via One UI 7 include the ability to "edit video sounds" and custom image and sticker creation. As the post notes, these are referencing Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> AI features. The patch finishes with a few bug fixes for widget errors, overlapping problems, and media card issues in One UI 7.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">teased a few advancements</a> coming for its AI-based Sketch to Image in One UI 7 back in January. The company stated the changes were centered around making the feature more "multimodal." Its upgrades let users utilize their S Pens, as well as the option of text descriptions and voice commands. One of its goals was to make Sketch to Image more available to users who'd rather use other means to generate an image.</p><p>More importantly, users can combine a rough sketch with their text/voice descriptions to make a more complete idea for the AI to polish up for you. While not explicitly stated in the patch notes, it appears that these One UI 7 upgrades have fallen onto Samsung's latest foldables in Beta 3.</p>

<p>It might make some users happy, considering One UI 7's AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">demand a lot from a phone</a>. An interview with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted that not every past-gen Galaxy device will see <em>every </em>AI feature. Some tools, like its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>, require stronger internal hardware, like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. As such, many "deeper AI experiences" will be left out of the software's debut on older phones.</p><p>The Flip 6 and Fold 6 started receiving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">the first beta</a> at the beginning of April. The initial download was roughly 5GB and packed many AI features and improvements that the Galaxy S24 first received in its Beta 1. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">was expected</a>, but we are still awaiting One UI 7's grand rollout for users without a Galaxy S25. One UI 7 is expected to arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">officially on April 10</a> for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Fold 6.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is pushing an update for its recent budget phone duo that introduces a new Essential feature and cleans up a few messes.</p><p>Kicking off the March 25 update for the Nothing Phone 3a Series is Essential Key compatibility with the Camera app. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/29173-nothing-os-31-update-for-3a-series">community post</a>, the company states this update for the new physical button concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and its 3a Pro</a> sibling. The Nothing OS 3.1 update features a quick video of how this will work for users.</p><p>In short, opening the Nothing camera app and pressing the Essential Key will take a photo, but save it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> area on your device. Users can then attach a written note to remind them of what the photo signifies.</p><p>Alternatively, long-pressing the key when in the camera app lets you add a voice memo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-essential-key-camera-demo" alt="The Nothing camera app receives support for the Essential Key on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3a and the 3a Pro will also receive a series of camera improvements once more. The changelog states the update brings more "intuitive" camera zoom interactions. The update "enhances white balance" for the rear cameras, improves "clarity and tone" for portraits in backlit scenarios, and improves the responsiveness of the camera.</p><p>Additionally, Nothing states it's fixed a strange "reddish skin tone issue in front-facing camera selfies." The Phone 3a Pro gets one specific camera change, which improves the focusing accuracy when utilizing 2x focal length.</p><p>The remainder of the patch notes for the 3a and the 3a Pro is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Optimised Essential Space experience and performance</li><li>Improved AOD (Always-On Display) transition animations</li><li>Various bug fixes and stability improvements.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-back-03" alt="Comparing the transparent backs of the grey Nothing Phone (3a) Pro with the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update has started rolling out; however, Nothing urges patience with its users, stating the patch is "gradually" making its rounds. Users can manually check if they have the update by hopping into <strong>Settings > System > System Updates</strong>. What's more, the company detailed its upcoming plans for the Essential Space, including Smart Collections, Focused Search, and Flip to Record.</p><p>Technically, this is the second update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">the 3a Pro</a>, as the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-3a-pro-gains-first-update-ahead-of-release">was a pre-launch OTA</a> that dropped right as the phones launched. There were a wealth of camera updates to improve its clarity in macro mode and performance for better photo quality. Moreover, Nothing's update helped its Essential Key and Space features, adding widgets and improving the button's interactions.</p><p>Aside from that, Nothing started emailing consumers in a few overseas areas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-pre-order-shipping-delay-email">about a shipment delay</a> for pre-ordered Phone 3a Pros. The email mostly concerned those in Europe, as the company states devices pre-ordered will now "ship before April 15."</p>

<ul><li>Google is releasing Gemini 2.5 starting today for Gemini Advanced subscribers.</li><li>Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is the first model to ship, and it is an industry-leader in benchmarks.</li><li>All Gemini 2.5 models are thinking models with native multimodality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, is rolling out starting today, March 25, with an experimental release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking">blog post</a>. Gemini 2.5 is Google's "most intelligent AI model" yet, per the company. The experimental version of Gemini 2.5 Pro backs up that claim, ranking first on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank">LMArena's leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>.</p><p>Google has been ramping up its AI development, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">releasing the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model</a> last month. It can conduct multi-step reasoning and use certain techniques to reach a conclusion, all while the end user can trace its reasoning process in real time.</p><p>This time around, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 models</a> are thinking models, and are "capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy."</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro sits atop many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), and Google says it achieved this feat by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>

<p>The release and development of Gemini 2.5 is intended to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">push Google further into the agentic era</a>. The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models moving forward so that they can solve complex problems and serve as context-aware AI agents.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro also performs well in knowledge, science, and math benchmarks. It scored 18.8% on Humanity’s Last Exam without tool use, which beats all other competitors by a significant margin. Google describes this test as "a dataset designed by hundreds of subject matter experts to capture the human frontier of knowledge and reasoning."</p>

<p>With native multimodality, this series of Gemini AI models can intake text, audio, images, video, and large code repositories for extra context.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Pro is said to perform better at coding, hence why it is shipping today in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-used-the-gemini-api-and-ai-studio-to-make-the-i-o-2025-puzzle">Google AI Studio</a>. It'll also come to Vertex AI at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-2-5-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Gemini 2.5 Pro pricing and availability </h2>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro is available starting today for business and personal accounts with a one million token context window. It's available in Google AI Studio and the Gemini web client and mobile apps. Currently, Gemini 2.5 Pro is exclusive to Gemini Advanced and requires a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a> ($20/month).</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro will arrive in Vertex AI in the coming weeks, and its context window will soon expand to two million tokens.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly "planning" to introduce several third-party apps into the fold for One UI 7's Now Bar.</li><li>Many are still unknown; however, rumors state Kakao T, Naver Sports, YouTube, and YouTube Music could be on the way.</li><li>A rumor from mid-March claimed Samsung was looking into "forced" third-party support and more customization options for the Now Bar via Good Lock.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing again about Samsung's apparent interest in expanding app support for a key One UI 7 feature.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20250324000350?">ETNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung is "planning" to introduce several third-party apps to users with Now Bar compatibility (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/samsung-now-bar-third-party-apps-report/#more-666321">9to5Google</a>). The Korean OEM is reportedly going to bring these additional apps to One UI 7's Now Bar with "cross-app actions." As the post notes, this is one of the key features of the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S25 series</a>, so it seems there's a chance Samsung wants to keep this consistent even with third-party additions.</p><p>Regarding what Samsung could bring, there's speculation from an alleged industry source that the Now Bar could add Kakao T and Naver Sports. The former is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoT?lang=en">transportation app</a> in South Korea responsible for taxis, driver bookings, and scooter sharing. The post states the addition of Naver Sports could be similar to the likes of Google Sports.</p><p>There is more to be expected; however, the report didn't express what those could be. However, it curiously highlights YouTube and YouTube Music, stating those apps are "not yet installed." It seems Samsung is moving to bring those into the Now Bar (which would be nice), but nothing's clear just yet.</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-now-bar-module-rumored">surfaced a week ago</a> about Samsung's alleged plans for the future of the Now Bar, which includes third-party apps. Though a small mention, a tipster claimed Samsung was moving along with an update that would bring "forced support for all third-party apps." Fortunately, this new South Korean report gives us a better idea of what <em>might </em>show up for the Now Bar if all goes well.</p><p>The core of that previous rumor was the new customization features the company is supposedly working on. Speculation states the Now Bar will receive a dedicated Good Lock module that'll let users change its color, size, and animations.</p><p>Meanwhile, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-lock-screen-now-bar-update-rollout">Google Sports update</a> for the Now Bar dropped earlier this month. The patch essentially made it easier for users to see the scores they want and keep up with their favorite teams in a streamlined way. Users can browse through "Following" and "Recommended" sports/team tabs, as well as a full list of available organizations. That update for One UI 7 made it even easier for users to manage their notifications, too.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series </a>out of the way, we've been seeing some insane Galaxy S26 leaks coming in. The most recent one brings more input on the high-end Ultra model's cameras.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/wild-galaxy-s26-ultra-rumor-hints-at-insane-camera-upgrades/">SammyGuru</a> spotted a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SiddhantGeek/status/1904490741394473052"> post on X,</a> that revealed extensive specs of the cameras that the Samsung Galaxy S26 could come with. Siddhant B, claims that these specs were first put out by avid tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve,</a> known for leaking Samsung-related news.</p><p>The post by Siddhant claims that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with a variable aperture, on its primary wide 200MP lens. This means, that the user could change the aperture of the lens while taking a picture. The aperture could vary anywhere between f/1.4 and f/4.0. This would allow users to manually pick the desired f-stop based on the primary light they have while shooting pictures. In retrospect, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's wide lens comes with an unchangeable f/1.7 aperture setting.</p><p>Aperture is measured in f-stops, which determines how much light enters the lens providing better-quality images. For instance, a wider opening of the lens allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter image in low-light settings. While smaller lens opening allows for less light to enter the lens, which is ideal when shooting outdoors on a sunny day(aka, f/4.0 could be the aperture setting in this situation).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-top-down-view-back-1" alt="Top-down view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, the X post states that while the Galaxy S26 Ultra will keep its predecessor's 200 MP wide lens, it will also be taking the 50MP ultra-wide camera along as well, which has a 1/2.52-inch sensor with 0.7µm pixels, 13mm focal length, and an f/1.9 fixed aperture.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims that the Korean OEM will be ditching Galaxy S25 Ultra's 10MP telephoto lens for a larger 50 MP lens with a 3.5x optical zoom, which has a 1/3.15inch sensor, 80mm focal length that will have a F/2.4 aperture. The other telephoto lens won't be left behind, since it will get an 8x zoom, an upgrade from the 5x optical zoom on its predecessor. This 50MP lens will have a 184mm focal length, and a  1/2.76-inch sensor, with an f/3.0 aperture.</p><p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi's 14 Ultra </a>showcases variable aperture, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-50-launch">Huawei's Mate 50 Pro</a> and if these rumors were even close to being true, then the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a much-needed camera upgrade that will allow users more control over clicking photos on the device. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">another rumor claims </a>that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with subtle hardware changes like thinner bezels, and could see charging capabilities between 45W to 50W.

At $549, they are ridiculously expensive and feature controversial design decisions — like a heavy aluminum construction and no power button. On March 24, Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" target="_blank">announced</a> that AirPods Max (USB-C) will gain support for lossless, wired audio and low-latency Bluetooth audio in an update next month.</p><p>But is that enough to move the needle for AirPods Max, an expensive and flawed pair of over-ear headphones?</p><p>Make no mistake: the AirPods Max should've supported wired audio from the very beginning. In fact, the older Lightning version of AirPods Max <em>did</em> support wired audio, albeit with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK22AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12m-white" target="_blank">$35 proprietary cable</a> that's no longer sold by Apple. However, when the company refreshed the headphones with a USB-C variant, that feature was seemingly dropped.</p><p>Now, Apple is bringing wired audio back to the AirPods Max, this time using the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes in the box. It's also selling a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for the new AirPods Max separately for other audio sources. At face value, this update — when it reaches AirPods Max (USB-C) owners in April — seems like a big upgrade. That is until you realize that almost all of Apple's competitors already supported wired audio on their over-ears.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite AirPods Max competitors for Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a>, shipped with wired audio capabilities from day one. Sonos includes a USB-C to USB-C and a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the box, while Dyson sells a USB-C to 3.5mm cable separately for $20. The same goes for other excellent over-ear headphones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><p>Put simply, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> already support the feature Apple is just adding to the AirPods Max next month — it's not exactly groundbreaking.</p><p>Even Apple's own Beats headphones have worked with wired inputs for years. The current generation of Beats Studio Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> both support wired use, not only with a USB-C to USB-C cable but also with an inbuilt 3.5mm jack. That means the Studio Pro and Solo 4, both of which are Apple-made headphones costing a fraction of the price of AirPods Max, are actually more versatile.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK" name="beats-solo-4-usbc-aux-ports.jpg" alt="Beats Solo 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Beats Solo 4 cost under $200 and have two wired audio ports: USB-C and 3.5mm. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update heading to AirPods Max (USB-C) units in April was long overdue. Despite the headphones costing a fortune, they weren't truly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">"lossless" or "high-fidelity"</a> due to their reliance on wireless connection. When AirPods Max get the ability to use a cable, they'll finally unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio.</p><p>Aside from the sound quality boost, there are a few practical benefits to using a cable. For instance, most airlines still rely on the 3.5mm jack for inflight entertainment. Unless you want to be using the cheap, tinny earbuds flight attendants pass around instead of your $549 headphones, you'll want them to support wired audio.</p><p>That's why I'm glad Apple finally got onboard — every pair of over-ear headphones should have a wired audio option.</p>
<h2 id="airpods-max-still-aren-t-a-great-buy-2">AirPods Max still aren't a great buy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j" name="Apple-AirPods-hero-240909_big.jpg.large_2x" alt="AirPods lineup, including the USB-C AirPods Max." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1960" height="1102" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing: AirPods Max are still an incomplete product, even with the latest set of upgrades. When Apple upgraded the AirPods Max, it added USB-C and new colors and not much else. To that end, the $130 AirPods 4 are using newer chips and audio technology than the $549 AirPods Max. The same goes for the $249 AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2.</p><p>With the incoming update, Apple is touting that AirPods Max (USB-C) will support ultra-low latency audio over a wireless connection with Apple devices. But as it turns out, AirPods Max won't support wireless lossless audio with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Of course, there aren't that many Vision Pro owners out there, but with that being said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> both support this feature thanks to their newer H2 chip.</p><p>It underscores that this feature drop for AirPods Max doesn't change the fact that they are lacking not only compared to competitors but also to Apple's own products. AirPods Max (USB-C) should've supported wired audio from the beginning. Even when it does, plenty of alternatives—like the QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM5—will still be a better option at roughly half the price.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Qualcomm might scrap the "Elite" branding for its next chipset and go with Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.</p><p>According to leaker Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, Qualcomm is gearing up to introduce the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 next month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-Elite-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-4-leak-outs-launch-info-and-key-details-of-the-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-3-successor.986339.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). We’ve already got some early specs floating around thanks to recent leaks, giving us a sneak peek at what this chip is packing under the hood.</p><p>Keeping up with Qualcomm’s chip lineup isn’t easy, but the flagship series is a bit more straightforward. Qualcomm typically launches a top-tier SoC along with an “s” variant for budget-friendly flagships each year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> getting some pretty positive market feedback, all eyes are now on the upcoming sub-flagship chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Contrary to earlier speculations</a>, DCS says Qualcomm is ditching the Snapdragon 8s Elite name in favor of Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>The name change likely comes down to architecture. Unlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite with Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, the the 8s Gen 4 is sticking with off-the-shelf ARM designs.</p>
<h2 id="power-and-efficiency-mix-2">Power and efficiency mix</h2>
<p>According to DCS, the chip, designed as SN8735, will pack a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, backed by three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores for heavy lifting. For better efficiency, it's expected to also include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>On the graphics front, the new chip is expected to rock an Adreno 825 GPU. They're from the same next-gen family, but leaks suggest Qualcomm might be trimming down the core size a bit. This means you'll still get great mobile gaming performance; just don't expect it to quite match the absolute top-tier 8 Elite's graphical muscle.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pka9pm13K" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, the leaker says the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will use the same ISP as the Snapdragon 8 Elite.

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly working on another XR gear that will launch alongside its XR headset via Project Moohan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250321000270">ETNews</a>, the Korean OEM is working on launching its first pair of XR smart glasses dubbed Project "HAEAN" which loosely translates to the sea coast or seashore according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-could-soon-be-able-to-explain-its-translations-better">Google Translate</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, the company is working on finalizing what these glasses will set out to do. Much like the XR headset, it could be powered by Galaxy AI, and will be much smaller than the head-mounted XR gear.</p><p>"They display information or images on the glasses like the lenses of glasses and transmit sound from the frame," the publication added.</p><p>These glasses will likely be pitted against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">Meta's RayBan </a>smart glasses, which can be worn outdoors and interact with the surroundings, possibly with the help of AI. Previous<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped"> leaks</a> indicated that they could weigh around 50 grams, have multiple cameras, and be coupled with the ability to make payments and respond to gestures and facial recognition.</p><p>It is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">claimed</a> that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit. The device could allegedly have a 12 MP camera with a Sony IMX681 CMOS image sensor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">SamMobile</a> indicated that these mixed reality glasses will have a "155mAh battery Google's Gemini LLM will be installed on the device to provide AI features."</p>

<p>ETnews adds that Samsung is making sure that these glasses are comfortable to wear and is "putting a lot of effort into a design tailored to the human body."</p><p>Last year, Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">trademarked</a> its smart glasses at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. It was filed under the “Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses” categories.</p><p>An industry insider to ETnews, “With Apple’s Vision Pro already on the market, Samsung’s focus will be on providing a more advanced user experience.” While we don't know when these XR glasses could see the light of day, the publication very confidently says that it will be launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset </a>which is expected to launch later this year, after Samsung showed it off more vividly at the MWC 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has a new accessory for its users to charge their phones effortlessly and that too in a smaller form factor.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus Slim Magnetic Power Bank, it will be available for purchase through the OnePlus website for the U.S. market for $70. As the name suggests, the latest power bank is quite slimmer measuring 0.88cm in height at its thinnest. It further measures 9.6cm in length and 6.9cm in width.</p>

<p>On the whole, it will weigh around 120 grams. It is believed to be done by using high energy density battery cells, next to N52M magnets, and “a body composed of aluminum alloy to reduce overall thickness and weight,” OnePlus shares in an accompanying press release.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Slim power bank packs in a decent 5000mAh battery capacity that provides USB Type-C charging next to supporting wireless charging, which claims to charge two iPhones at a time — since it is MagSafe compatible. There aren’t faster wireless charging speeds as they are limited to 7.5W for iPhones and 10W for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Even in the wired charging case, the power bank is limited to 10W wired charging.</p>

<p>Other perks of the power bank comprise NTC intelligent temperature control, which promises to ensure that the battery does not overheat when charging. It is a four-bar LED power status indicator to give you an idea of the juice left in the power bank.</p><p>To ensure safer travel, OnePlus Slim is in compliance with international air transport regulations, meaning it can be easily carried in planes and bullet trains to keep your devices charged at all times.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company is also offering a bunch of bundle offers (from March 25 to April 30) for those who purchase this power bank coupled with its latest flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. And for those who have purchased the OnePlus 13 already — they’ll have special offers if they make the purchase via the company website.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo stated at the end of last year that it would debut a mixed reality headset, and at the Boao Forum for Asia, the Chinese manufacturer showcased the design of the Vision. The design looks to be a sleeker version of the Apple Vision Pro, but at this point, there's no mention of what the headset weighs, and the materials used in its construction. <br><br>Vivo says it will debut the prototype in mid-2025, and other than that, it didn't divulge much in the way of information around the headset. The MR headset is a part of Vivo's strategy to "strengthen its real-time spatial computing capabilities for future applications in consumer robotics," and coinciding with the design showcase, Vivo is announcing the establishment of a new robotics laboratory in China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2666px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.04%;"><img id="qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n" name="Vivo Vision Discovery Edition" alt="Vivo Vision design reveal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2666" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo will leverage the lab to build the "brain" and "eyes" of robots, utilizing its skillset when it comes to "AI large learning models and imaging." Vivo clearly is no stranger to doing a great job with imaging, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is currently the best camera phone to beat. So it will be interesting to see how the brand can translate these proficiencies to robotics. <br><br>Switching back to phones, Vivo has announced that it will unveil the X200 Ultra in the month of April. The manufacturer teased the camera modules last week, and earlier leaks gave us a better understanding of what the device will be able to deliver in this area, and having tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> as well as the X200 Pro, I can't wait to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how Vivo manages to outshine the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> from last year. <br><br>However, it is likely the X200 Ultra may not debut outside China — much like its predecessor. We should know more about the device in the coming weeks, along with details on the Vivo Vision.</p>

<p>Motorola’s next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable flagship</a> is already making moves, popping up in certification filings ahead of launch, and a new regulatory listing hints at some serious hardware upgrades inside.</p><p>A new listing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://zd.taf.org.cn/#/equipmentDetail?code=34JfIVH%2BvTrlMf8jYpLKnS3dxml4OPYSqQZKXiv6M0hgV5NTK9C621FDd6Y0%2F9AtLR7k9WyZIlDX3aQ4d%2BWDSw%3D%3D" target="_blank">TENAA</a>, China's telecommunications certification authority, sheds light on a new device called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra, which is expected to be the global name for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_60_ultra_appears_on_tenaa_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67071.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>According to the listing shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1903651511759986956" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a>, the Razr Plus 2025 packs a dual-cell battery with rated capacities of 1,090mAh and 3,185mAh, totaling at least 4,275mAh. Anvin suggests the typical capacity could hit 4,500mAh.</p>

<p>The next-gen Razr Plus may keep the 2024 model’s design, but Motorola is clearly making some big moves under the hood.</p>

<p>The new battery marks a big jump from the previous model’s 4,000mAh.

It’s also expected to pack dual 50MP rear cameras, a 50MP selfie snapper, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, with up to 18GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>
<h2 id="standard-razr-shrinks-and-switches-the-processor-2">Standard Razr shrinks and switches the processor</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Motorola Razr 2025 is rumored to pack the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM. In a surprising twist, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/" target="_blank">XpertPick </a>suggests it’ll shrink to a 6.7-inch display, down from the 6.9-inch screens used in previous models, including the 2024 Razr.</p><p>The regular model could also arrive in three colors: Pantone Gibraltar (blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and Spring Bud (green).</p><p>Motorola usually launches its Razr foldables in China first before going global, so chances are the company will stick to the same game plan this time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-62">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>An OPPO-branded phone (PKX110) just cleared 3C certification, likely the OnePlus 13T or 13 Mini.</li><li>The listing reveals an 80W charging speed, but everything else is still a guessing game.</li><li>The phone is expected to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and a 6000mAh battery, just like the OnePlus 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh leak has shed light on the key specs and features of OnePlus’ upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact flagship</a>, the OnePlus 13T.</p><p>A mysterious OPPO-branded device, labeled PKX110, just passed 3C certification in China (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/23/oneplus-13t-3c-certified-snapdragon-8-elite-compact-phone-spotted-with-80w-charger/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>). While the certification doesn’t reveal its official name, reliable leaker Digital Chat Station speculates it could be the OnePlus 13T or possibly the OnePlus 13 Mini (as others like to call it), based on clues shared on Weibo.</p><p>The only thing the certification disclosed is the device’s 80W fast charging, while everything else is still under wraps.</p><p>Even though the listing doesn’t reveal much, earlier leaks and rumors suggest the device could sport a 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display. Now, whether that counts as "compact" in 2025 remains debatable. Some may call it pocket-friendly; others may say it's just average-sized.</p><p>Previous leaks also suggest the OnePlus 13T will pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with a 6000mAh battery, matching the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is rumored to feature a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details on the front camera are still under wraps. As for the rear camera setup, it’s not confirmed whether it’ll be vertical or horizontal, but leaks suggest a vertical layout.</p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-oneplus-t-series-2">The return of OnePlus' T-series</h2>
<p>The upcoming phone marks the revival of the brand's T-series, the first since the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. Pricing is still a mystery, but with the OnePlus 13 starting at $899 and the 13R at $600, expect the 13T to land somewhere in that ballpark.</p><p>Leaks suggest the OnePlus 13T will stick with an optical fingerprint sensor, keeping in line with previous OnePlus flagships instead of switching to the ultrasonic tech used in the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The exact launch date is still up in the air, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-compact-flagship-phone-may-finally-have-a-launch-date">reports point to a China release in May</a> or late April.</p>

<hr>
<p>Truly-wireless earbuds are notoriously difficult to clean, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are no exception. This month, Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/330665949/mesh-cleaning-tips-for-pixel-buds-pro-2" target="_blank">support document</a> detailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-your-headphones-earbuds">how to clean the Pixel Buds Pro 2 safely</a> to improve sound quality (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-clean-mesh/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Specifically, the guide explains how to clean the rear vent mesh on the earbuds, which can help resolve "audio issues or unwanted noise."</p><p>When the earbuds are placed in your ear, the rear vent mesh is located at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. The mesh can be blocked by things like earwax or dust over time, and so can the small opening on each earbud. Debris blocking Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh or openings "can greatly affect the audio quality," per the company.</p>

<p>Luckily, it's easy to clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few household items. You'll need an extra soft toothbrush, a paper towel, tap water, and Micellar water. The latter, Micellar water, is a type of water infused with small particles that can soak up debris like dust, dirt, or earwax. You can find it online or at grocery stores.</p><p>The following are Google's step-by-step instructions for cleaning Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Pour regular water in a cup and micellar water into another.</li><li>Dip the toothbrush in micellar water and swish around so that the bristles are saturated. Hold your earbud in one hand and brush the mesh in deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Blot the earbud on a paper towel to dry the earbud mesh. Repeat steps 2 and 3 twice.</li><li>Rinse your toothbrush by dipping it in micellar water and then dip it in regular water. Swirl your toothbrush in the water to make sure the bristles are clean from earwax.</li><li>Brush the mesh one last time with deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Give your Pixel Buds Pro 2 at least  2 hours to air dry and make sure they’re completely dry before use. You can blot the earbud on a paper towel to gently, yet thoroughly, get rid of any residual water.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Additionally, Google notes some things you shouldn't do when trying to clean your Pixel Buds Pro 2. That includes using Q-tips, which the company says could push dust, dirt, or earwax deeper into the earbuds' mesh. Additionally, the support page warns against using detergents, sprays, and alcohol, since they can break Pixel Buds Pro 2 components. Finally, you shouldn't clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 while charging them.</p><p>While this new guide covers the rear mesh specifically, Google has a complete Pixel Buds cleaning guide available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9112670" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support is beginning to roll out.</li><li>At least one user has gained access to the advanced features, which were showcased as part of Project Astra.</li><li>Google confirmed the live video and screen sharing features are rolling out for Gemini Advanced subscribers now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini Live's real-time video and screen sharing support is rolling out now for Gemini Advanced subscribers. The move is a long time coming for Google, which previewed this functionality as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> as far back as Google I/O 2024. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1jh42op/you_can_now_share_your_screen_mobile_to_gemini/" target="_blank">user on Reddit</a> first spotted the features' availability on a Xiaomi device, and Google later confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634480/google-gemini-live-video-screen-sharing-astra-features-rolling-out" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that they are beginning to roll out.</p><p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, Google showcased the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features and revealed that they would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">become available in late March</a>. Now, the ability to share live video and your phone screen in real-time is slowly rolling out, so the company is hitting its target. With this functionality, you can show Gemini Live what's around you — or what you're seeing on your phone — and ask questions about it with natural conversation.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ji04ja/a_short_demo_of_project_astra_share_screen_with">A short demo of Project Astra (Share screen with Live)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard">r/Bard</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Currently, if you activate Gemini, you may see an <strong>Ask about screen</strong> option. When the new Gemini Live capabilities fully roll out, you'll also see a <strong>Share screen with Live</strong> option if you're a Google One AI Premium subscriber. The former only takes a screenshot to share with Gemini, while the latter starts a real-time screen share that continues as your conversation with Gemini Live progresses.</p><p>Users will need to pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a>, which costs $20 per month, for access to Gemini Live with video streaming capabilities. With that being said, new Pixel phone purchases come with free trials of varying lengths, so Pixel 9 series owners may get the Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support for free.</p><p>While the new Gemini Live functionality is expected to come to various Android devices, Google specifically noted that newer devices would gain access first (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/22/gemini-live-astra-rollout-start/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25 launch, Google said Pixel phones and the Galaxy S25 lineup would be “among the first to get Project Astra capabilities like screen sharing and live video streaming.”</p>

<p>The new Motorola Razr 2025 series seems to be showing up on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""> multiple leaks lately</a>, considering it could be released sometime in June this year, much like its predecessors. In the most recent leak, the alleged we get to see the first look of the alleged Motorola Razr 2025, also referred to as the "Motorola Razr 60" from all angles, a new colorway, with major specs also tipped off (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/motorola-razr-2025-display-battery-colors-leak/">via 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The most recent leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/">Xpertpick</a>, which showed off renders of the alleged phone from all angles, including a new colorway that hasn't been a part of any recent leaks. The new color, dubbed "Spring Bug," showcases the device in a vibrant green hue, along with the other rumored colorways, such as dark blue and light grey colors dubbed “Gibraltar Sea" and  “Lightest Sky,” respectively.</p><p>Xpertpick further notes that their exclusive report is in collaboration with a "trusted source" that states that the Motorola Razr 2025 will see a smaller display of 6.7 inches when compared to 6.9 inches on the 2024 model. It will also support "wet touch functionality," enabling the user to use the screen even with wet hands.</p>

The device is said to stick to a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen.

<p>The year 2025 is off to a fantastic start as far as budget and mid-range smartphones go. We've already got a pretty eclectic range of options to choose from, our current favorite being the Nothing Phone 3a. As a successor to the highly popular Phone 2a, the 3a offers a useful third telephoto camera, slightly quicker charging, and a brighter OLED display. It's not easily available everywhere, like in the U.S., which is where the Moto G Power 2025 comes in.</p><p>Motorola's offering is cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a</a>, more readily available in the U.S., and has stronger waterproofing. It's also a solid and dependable phone with equally lean software, a decently long update commitment for its price, and you get wireless charging. Deciding between the Nothing Phone 3a vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> can get tricky, but that's where we come in.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-vs-moto-g-power-2025-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3a vs. Moto G Power 2025: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr" name="nothing-phone-3a-back-01" alt="The transparent back of the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a follows the company's signature look of a transparent glass back panel with neatly laid out components. The side frame is plastic but it's matte so there's good enough grip when you hold it and it doesn't look cheap. We have the programmable Glyph lights too around the camera module which are a fun addition. The phone is slim but a bit weighty at 201 grams. Nothing has given it an IP64 rating for dust and splash resistance. While this is better than the 2a, it's not great for a mid-range phone in 2025. The 3a comes in white, black, and blue, but the latter is limited to select markets.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a's display is nicely specced with a large 6.77-inch AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate. It's a Full-HD resolution only but the pixel count is well above 300 ppi, so images and text look sharp. Nothing has chosen Panda Glass for scratch protection, which held up well when we tested it. Brightness levels are also pretty great with up to 1,300 nits when using it outdoors and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mEjXt3Ws9TnupeDZLqYxmF" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-04" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down on a yellow surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEjXt3Ws9TnupeDZLqYxmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 has slightly taller dimensions but similar thickness and weight as the Phone 3a. The design is now similar to Motorola's more premium phones, which gives the G Power better street cred. We also liked the tough build quality of the phone which earns it a MIL-STD-810H rating. The back panel is made of faux-leather instead of glass but it still looks and feels quite premium. The lack of glass also means there's no worry of any shattering if you drop it. The G Power 2025 comes in a striking Leaf Green colorway and also Slate Gray.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 doesn't have a very captivating display as the Nothing Phone 3a, but it gets the job done. It's a 6.8-inch IPS panel with a similar resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and Gorilla Glass 5 scratch protection. The display worked fine in all lighting conditions during our review period, and we didn't face any issues.</p><p>The one design feature that really makes this phone stand out if the IP68/ IP69 rating. IP69 is something that's not available even on most flagship phones, so to see this on a $300 phone is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a is only available in the U.S. via the beta program, which means you need to jump through a few hoops in order to get it. As of writing this, Nothing's website says the 3a is sold out and new stocks are only expected in two months. Only the top-end variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is listed for $379. Nothing does sell a base variant too with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage in other markets for less. Apart from availability, there are compatibility issues right now with AT&T and Verizon's networks, but T-Mobile works just fine.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> processor, which is a budget SoC optimized to improve AI performance. Sadly, gaming performance is actually worse than its predecessor, which is a step down. We noticed lower FPS in games like Minecraft on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">Phone 3a vs. the 2a</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, battery life is very good for a phone of its class. The 5,000mAh capacity will easily carry you through more than a day before you'll need to charge it. The 50W wired charging also ensures the battery is charged quickly, although you'll need to buy the charger separately. Wireless charging is a bit of a miss, something that the Moto offers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 delivers equally good battery life with the same capacity as the 3a. Charging speed is slower at 30W and you'll need to buy the adapter separately. There is 15W wireless charging, which is pretty good for a phone of its class.</p><p>The G Power 2025 only comes in a single variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for $299. This makes it more affordable than the Phone 3a. Being a Motorola, you'll also easily find it online or at offline stores in the U.S. and it's compatible with all the major carriers. What's not so great though is the performance. Somehow, Motorola picked a worse SoC than the 2024 model for the new G Power and that shows even in everyday use. Even with 8GB of RAM and a clean UI, we noticed intermittent lag and sluggishness when using it. It's certainly not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">best phone gaming</a> and performs worse than the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>With the Nothing Phone 3a, you get three OS upgrades and six years of security patches. The phone ships with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and includes all the latest AI features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been"> Essential Space</a>. This feature is still in beta but the dedicated button makes it very easy to fire up some of the apps like voice memo or note-taking, when needed. More smart features like Smart Search, Smart Collections, and Focus Search are expected to come in a future update. The interface is clean and bloat-free, which is something we really like about Nothing's software approach.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 has a similar near-stock Android-like experience. You get Android 15 out of the box but only two major OS upgrades after that. Motorola hasn't had the best track record of issuing timely updates either so we'll take this promise with a bit of salt for now. As we mentioned above, the interface does get sluggish at times even if you're not doing anything taxing. There aren't many AI features either as that isn't really the focus of this phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-2" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing debuts a telephoto camera on its phones for the first time in the Phone 3a (and 3a Pro). The 3a boasts an impressive 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom. There's also a 50MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide. In our testing, we came away impressed with the image quality from all the cameras, which is a big improvement over the Phone 2a. The phone can also do 4K 30fps videos, which is pretty respectable.</p><p>The cameras on the Moto G Power 2025 are serviceable under good lighting, but that's about it. You only get a 50MP wide and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor on the back, both of which deliver okay image quality. The same goes for the 16MP selfie camera, which is no match for the 32MP sensor in the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>If you live in a region outside the U.S. where the Nothing Phone 3a is easily available, you should 100% buy it over the Moto G Power 2025. It might cost a bit more, but you'll be getting a vastly better-looking phone as well as excellent cameras, good performance, slick software with a longer update cycle, and quicker charging. Apart from the weaker waterproofing and no wireless charging, there's no major con going against it. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is also worth considering if you need better telephoto and selfie cameras.</p><p>For those living in the U.S., the Moto G Power 2025 is still a good buy at $300. If your priority is battery life and a phone that can survive a dishwasher, there's nothing better in this segment. You should be able to find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> for around $329 online as an alternative to the Moto. The Pixel gets you much better cameras, an OLED screen, an IP67 rating, and software updates till early 2028.</p>

<p>The iPhone vs. Android debate is as old as time but sometimes, the decision is not that simple. In the case of the iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R, those coming from an older number series iPhone might hesitate to get a new iPhone with just one camera and an older design. That's where the OnePlus 13R poses a real threat as it's a pretty compelling alternative to the 16e at the same price.</p><p>The biggest strength of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> is that it uses (nearly) the same chipset as the latest 16 series and it supports Apple Intelligence. It's compact, has great battery life, and supports wireless charging (although, no MagSafe). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> to buy. It has proper flagship specs that give the 16e a run for its money, on paper. But it's not the easiest to get a hold of in all countries and not everyone wants to carry around a massive slab of metal and glass in their pockets.</p><p>Putting aside the whole iOS vs. Android preference for a second, let's see if the 16e makes a strong enough case against the 13R.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-design-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e is the spiritual successor of the iPhone SE but thankfully, Apple has finally done away with Touch ID and the thick bezels of that series. Instead, the 16e looks very much like the iPhone 14 with flat sides, front, and back. The bezels around the display are thicker than the iPhone 16 but that was to be expected. The phone sports Face ID in the old-style Apple notch and the mute switch has been replaced by the Action Button. You don't get the Camera Control button from the 16, which is fine.</p><p>The 16e gets a glass back, a USB-C port, and only eSIM support in U.S. models. Sadly, there are only two colors to choose from, white or black. My guess is Apple sort of knew that the 16e would not be that popular at launch, given the reduction in features and higher price than the SE, but we could see more colors added later in the year or with next year's revision based on how well it sells.</p><p>What you'll love with the iPhone 16e is the amazingly compact size and low weight. Compared to the 13R, the 16e is just 167 grams and measures only 7.8mm in thickness. That's a pretty slim and light phone, something that we don't see too many of in the Android world. The 16e is also IP68 rated which again trumps the IP65 rating of the 13R.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is a massive phone compared to the 16e in dimensions and weight, but manages to be nearly as slim. It is built well with aluminum and glass all around and it looks like a typical Android flagship. You only get two colors here, Nebula Noir and Astral Trail, similar to the 16e. The 13R bears a lot of resemblance to the flagship OnePlus 13, just without the Hasselblad branding.</p><p>The 13R features the signature OnePlus slider for quickly changing alert modes, which is something the 16e's Action button can also be configured to do. There's USB-C with 80W fast charging, an IP65 rating, but no wireless charging.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a pretty good display for a budget iPhone. It's a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED panel with a greater than Full-HD resolution, P3-color gamut support, and 1,200 nits of peak brightness for HDR content. Sadly, all non-Pro iPhones are still stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate and no always-on mode despite being an OLED screen. I guess it's going to take a lot more courage to add this than it did to remove the headphone jack. Thankfully, the display works just as well indoors as it does under direct sunlight, and we were quite happy with its performance when we tested it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R absolutely decimates the 16e's display with top-notch specs. It's a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with a higher 2,780 x 1,264 resolution, and a refresh rate that can vary from 1Hz to 120Hz. For scratch protection, there's Gorilla Glass 7i, and it has a rated peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The sheer size of the display makes viewing any sort of content infinitely better. The cutout for the selfie camera is also unobtrusive, unlike the 16e's notch.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16e starts at $599 for 128GB of storage, $699 for 256GB, and $899 for 512GB. All variants feature 8GB of RAM since that's the minimum needed for Apple Intelligence. The base model is probably something most buyers would consider as paying anything more doesn't make sense for such compromised specs. The good thing is that you can easily get this via your carrier in the U.S. for a small monthly fee.</p><p>The iPhone 16e has the same A18 SoC found in the iPhone 16, but with one GPU core disabled. As a result, benchmark numbers are a bit lower but you'll barely notice any performance hit in real-world usage. All games run well and multitasking is a cakewalk for the 16e.</p><p>Battery life is also one of the big highlights here as the new in-house Apple C1 5G modem proves to be more power-efficient than any of the Qualcomm ones in other iPhone models. Coupled with a fairly large 3,961mAh capacity, you should easily get a full day's worth of usage out of it, or even more. There's fast charging but it's only 20W, which isn't really considered fast in 2025. The 16e does support wireless charging at 7.5W but nothing higher like you get with other iPhones with MagSafe charging.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is available as a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage for $599.99, in the U.S.. It's not widely available from online retailers as of this writing, so your only option may be OnePlus.com. You'll also have to buy this unlocked only in the U.S., as none of the carriers offer any subsidies on it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R uses the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from Qualcomm, which can easily handle the most stressful apps and games without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, eSIM is one feature we found missing from the 13R, but the SIM slot can accept two SIM cards.</p><p>Battery life is on another level thanks to the beastly 6,000mAh capacity. In our testing, the OnePlus 13R easily lasted two full days on one charge, which is pretty insane. That's almost twice as long as the 16e lasted. It misses out on wireless charging, but I don't think anyone will miss it since there's support for 80W charging. Plus, you get the compatible charger in the box, which is not the case with the 16e.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe it but the iPhone 16e has just a single camera on the back. Apple calls it a "2-in-1" camera system where the 2x zoom mode crops in on the sensor for a zoomed-in view, without having to use digital zoom. It's a trick Apple has been using on its iPhones for a while. Zooming in any further though reveals visible noise in photos, as we found out in our review. Despite its budget stature, the 16e can still record Dolby Vision videos at 4K 60fps. The front 12MP camera is similar to the iPhone 16. The 16e misses out on some camera features like Action mode and Cinematic mode, which are present on the 16.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R has an upgraded 50MP main sensor, which does a superb job of capturing fine details in still photos. Unlike the 16e, you get an ultrawide and telephoto camera on the back. We didn't find the secondary cameras to be too impressive, though. The telephoto, while nice to have, can only do 2x optical zoom, so anything beyond that is still digital. The 16MP selfie camera is also strictly okay.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16e is primed to get several major iOS versions for at least the next four years. Not to mention, you'll always get a new update along with every other iPhone on day one. The 16e is majorly about getting Apple Intelligence into the hands of more users and while many of the AI features are still in beta, we found some useful ones when we tested it. Visual Intelligence for instance works similar to Google Lens, and is able to look up locations and objects easily by simply pointing the camera at it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a>, which is based on Android 15. OnePlus has pledged four years of OS upgrades which is decently long, but not great. The redesigned interface is slick and there are plenty of options to customize the look and feel to your liking. OnePlus isn't selling its AI features as aggressively as others, but there are a few useful ones baked in like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is the more powerful and feature-rich phone of the two, and is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. Even in the U.S., if you don't mind putting down $600 in one go, you should get the 13R over the iPhone 16e. It has a vastly better and bigger display, a great set of cameras, excellent performance, superb battery life, and slick software. The lack of wireless charging and the lower IP rating is not that big of a blow if you ask me.</p><p>The iPhone 16e is a great starter iPhone for Apple Intelligence once the price drops closer to $500. At full price, you might as well look for a good deal on the iPhone 15 instead which has an ultrawide camera and MagSafe charging. The Pixel 9a also makes for a good alternative and is worth checking out. If you're coming from a really old iPhone like the last SE or the Xr, then the 16e is a good upgrade, but only during sales.</p>

<p>You can connect any of the supported devices to function as your remote camera with the Connected Cameras feature. However, the devices need to be signed into the same Google account. Only one remote camera can be connected at a time. If you want to use a different device, disconnect the first camera and connect the other.</p><p>When recording, audio comes from the camera that is currently in use, so keep this in mind to ensure you get favorable sound to complement your video. Also, note that if you use a Bluetooth audio source, it can degrade the streaming quality of your video.</p><p>Connected Cameras is a useful new feature with the Google Pixel 9 series devices, which count among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>. It’s both convenient and fun for content creators looking to up their game or just experiment with recording and capturing moments in unique ways without having to own a complicated camera rig.</p>

<p><em><strong>Alex asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I saw the news about Google not complying with the EU regulations and I was wondering what would happen if Google just ignored it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Can Google be banned in Europe? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks </strong></em></p>
<p>Howdy Alex and thanks for such a great question!</p><p>Usually, I spend my thinking time wondering how Google will find ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">comply with laws and regulations</a> and still keep an advantage, and never thought about Google just saying no.</p><p>I've no doubt that's what it <em>really </em>wants to do: just laugh and keep on truckin' without a care. That's a way to make lots and lots of money, after all. But I don't think Google will. I also think the EU wouldn't go as far as kicking Google out of the continent (so to speak).</p>
<p>Normally, laws and regulations are set up as a compromise. A good example is how countries want factories to make goods but don't want them to just churn out pollution. A common ground must be found that benefits both sides and, in a best-case scenario, also benefits the citizenship. What we are seeing right now in the U.S. and elsewhere isn't quite normal, so it's easy to forget how it's <em>supposed</em> to work.</p><p>I think the EU's DMA (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>) is a really good idea. It's not perfect, but no set of regulations will ever be perfect. I also agree with the rulings that Google is violating and want to see the company forced to do the right thing, even if it costs them a little bit of money in the end.</p><p>I say I think they will find a solution, but let's explore what happens if they don't.</p>
<h2 id="two-worst-case-scenarios-2">Two worst-case scenarios</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3" name="google-my-ads-center-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google My Ad Center on a Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1389" height="781" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Google were to just ignore the DMA rulings two very bad things could happen.</p><p>The first is that the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-canada-trade-ban">banned from doing business</a> in the EU. While Google may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">unfairly using its status</a> to exert more control over things like payments and ads, a lot of people and companies are making money through the company. If Google were to be "banned," that means more than not being able to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamers-best-feature-comes-to-more-streaming-devices">TV Streamers</a>; it means not being able to sell ad space or services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-feature-drop-rolled-out-with-gemini-inclusion">Google Workspace,</a> and plenty of companies depend on those services.</p><p>Taking Google out of the picture would mean a mad scramble for companies to find replacements that might cost a lot more and could drive many of them out of business. EU regulators and Google both know this, and that's why I don't think this would ever happen — it would have a terrible effect on the very people the EU is claiming to protect and Google claims to want to serve.</p>
<p>Another possibility is even worse: Google says no, and the EU does nothing about it.</p><p>If Google were to just keep on doing business the way it always has, even though the DMA has ruled it can't, and <strong>nothing</strong> happens, it would open a floodgate. Other companies would see this and know that they might be able to ignore the law, and Google would 100% go further.</p><p>Imagine a trifecta of corporate greed consisting of Google, Meta, and Amazon, knowing they can do whatever they like without any repercussions. Executives would have visions of swimming in a pool filled with gold like Scrooge McDuck.</p><p>The reasons the DMA was enacted would then mean nothing, and companies would try to use any practices, fair or otherwise, to gain an advantage. Then they would use it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ" name="Verizon-att-t-mobile-bribe.jpg" alt="Illustration of carriers taking money from someone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EU is going to continue to make demands, and Google is going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-beats-eu-antitrust-case-avoids-dollar17b-fine-for-ad-monopoly">continue to fight them</a>. This is normal behavior between two sides with different goals. It's a shame so much money will be spent to try to find common ground, but it is what it is.</p><p>Fines will be levied, which Google will appeal and protest. In the end, the rulings will be "bent" slightly, so Google wins a little bit, and the company will pay some money for being so stubborn about it. We're talking traffic ticket level of justice here, not something like execs facing jail time or anything. There will be no re-enactment of Bastille Day or guillotines involved.</p><p>This will also send the right message to others: we (the EU) will find a way to enforce our laws and reign you in; we're not afraid to fight it out. Then Google will find another way to skirt the rules until it gets caught. There is too much money to be made for it to go any other way.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there's one thing that's clear, it's that Mobvoi isn't ready to give up on releasing new Wear OS smartwatches. This is definitely a good thing, considering that it's really the only alternative to Google and Samsung.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> released, and now, the TicWatch Atlas is here. Mobvoi must feel like it struck gold with the design of the TicWatch Pro 5, as the company has basically released three smartwatches that are almost identical, including the TicWatch Atlas.</p><p>Despite the name change, is the Atlas really all that different from the Enduro? Or is Mobvoi just trying to release something new for the sake of it?</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-price-and-availability"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Price and availability</span></h2>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-1" alt="TicWatch Atlas sitting in dirt and rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mobvoi announced the TicWatch Atlas in October 2024, arriving almost six months after the Pro 5 Enduro. It's still only available in one size, but there you can choose either the Black or Silver color way. The Atlas is priced at $349. It's currently available from Mobvoi directly, Amazon, and a few other online retailers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-what-i-like"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-3" alt="TicWatch Atlas on wrist showing secondary screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On paper, there's really not much to write home about when it comes to what the TicWatch Atlas has to offer compared to the Enduro. In fact, the specs are identical, with the only difference being in the markings on the bezel surrounding the screen.</p><p>You might be wondering why I would include this in this section, and it's simply because Mobvoi's taken a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a> is still the "newest" wearable SoC from Qualcomm. So I can't really give Mobvoi grief here, as it's not like the company has the capital and infrastructure to develop its own chip.</p><p>Plus, I have yet to deal with anything like stutters or slowdowns whenever I interact with the watch itself. Everything that the Atlas offers, just works, so I just really haven't found much to complain about.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Atlas continues Mobvoi's reign as the "battery champ" for wearables. Well, at least those that don't cost more than $500. I love being able to have a smartwatch that lasts for two to three days at a minimum but usually lasts even longer.</p><p>As I've said in my previous TicWatch reviews, I'm a big fan of the size, even if it isn't for everyone. Thankfully, for me, at least, that trend continues with the Atlas, as the watch just rests nicely on my wrist. Although I do have to point out that I wish there were more 24mm bands to choose from, that's not Mobvoi's fault.</p>

<p>This is all made possible by Mobvoi's dual-screen display, combining a 1.43-inch OLED screen with an Ultra low-power display. Just like previous iterations, this secondary screen basically operates as the "always-on display" but shows more information than just the time, date, and battery life.</p><p>You'll also find all of the "normal" stuff at your disposal, such as sleep tracking, a variety of workouts, blood oxygen monitoring, and more. There's even a new "Heat Map" feature, which Mobvoi says will keep track of "where you're most active" during a game. It's an interesting addition, but it isn't something that I actually tried because I don't play sports anymore unless you count the "run to keep my son from falling and bumping his head" game.</p>

<p>On the one hand, I want to give Mobvoi some kudos for releasing the TicWatch Atlas with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>. And while I want to give the company grief about the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, it's tough to do so when Google itself is dealing with rollout struggles for older hardware.</p><p>But there's one thing missing, literally one thing, that's making me go right back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> as soon as I'm done with this review — Google Assistant/Gemini. I don't care (all that much) that Wear OS 5 isn't available yet, partially because I've just accepted the fact that it'll probably be another year before it comes to the Pro 5, Enduro, or Atlas.</p><p>It's great being able to download and install apps from the Play Store while enjoying them on the Atlas's big OLED screen. But that fun starts to fade away when you expect (or at least hope) that the basic functions of similar smartwatches are just not there.</p><p>Searching for Assistant in the Play Store on the Atlas pulls up a bunch of results that don't matter. And while I've read about a few workarounds, I haven't tried them simply because I shouldn't have to. So, as much as I have truly enjoyed what Mobvoi has done over the past couple of years, I just can't get over this hurdle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-4" alt="TicWatch Atlas next to Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I've started to notice is that my wrist will vibrate. I'll look at the watch, and there's nothing. Nothing on my phone, nothing hidden in the notification tray, just nothing.</p><p>It seems that this might not actually be a problem with the Atlas specifically, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ghost-vibrations-user-reports">Galaxy Watch 7 owners</a> have reported similar issues. Since Samsung's latest wearable uses Wear OS 5, it's not like we can point to Wear OS 4 as the source of the problems.</p><p>Another gripe that I have is that I don't fully understand Mobvoi's wearable strategy. Going from the Pro 5 to the Pro 5 Enduro made sense, as the latter was just an iteration of the original. But here's the thing: the Atlas is just an iteration of the Enduro.</p><p>For some reason, Mobvoi opted to start an entirely "new" lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> with the Atlas despite only including very minor and subtle changes. While I'm not advocating for some type of drastic redesign, I think Mobvoi might have been better suited to go with the "TicWatch Pro 5 Atlas" instead. Or even use a different word, reserving "Atlas" for a different lineup.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-competition"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-run-activity.jpeg" alt="The main run activity data screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This would have been the year for the Atlas to really compete with the Galaxy Watch Classic. However, Samsung opted to ditch that version entirely this year, opting instead to go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a>. So when it comes to price, the Atlas is more of a competitor to the Watch 7, seeing as it's just $50 more.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's latest wearable wins out thanks to having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box, along with the ability to actually use Google Assistant. Plus, since Samsung uses smaller band sizes, you have many more options to choose from if you want to swap out the included band for something else.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is another viable competitor, although neither of Samsung's or Google's offers are going to be quite as durable as the Atlas. For the first time, Google offers two different sizes with the Watch 3, solving one of my big annoyances with the Pixel Watch and Watch 2.</p><p>Although Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-1-and-2-users-will-have-to-wait-for-wear-os-5">dealing with issues</a> surrounding the Wear OS 5 update for its first two smartwatches, that's not the case with the Watch 3. Even still, you get to enjoy <em>all</em> of the luxuries that Wear OS has to offer, without worrying about making any sacrifices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> seemingly came out of nowhere to challenge the Atlas for the title of "Battery King." The Watch 3 is rated for up to six days on a single charge, which can be stretched to seven if you turn off AOD and sleep tracking. But it also has the added benefit of super-fast charging, with a 20-minute charge adding "about 75% to the battery, and another 20 minutes will bring it to a full charge."</p><p>That's not to say the Watch 3 is perfect. Those in North America can't use the built-in ECG, and like the Atlas, it lacks LTE connectivity and is only available in one size. But along with being less expensive, OnePlus has already committed to two software updates and quarterly security patches.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best battery life in a Wear OS smartwatch.</li><li>You want a rugged smartwatch for under $400.</li><li>You don't care about having the latest version of Wear OS.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to be able to use Google Assistant.</li><li>You already own the TicWatch Pro 5 or Pro 5 Enduro.</li><li>You're on a budget.</li></ul>
<p>Maybe it's because I've already used and reviewed both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and Pro 5 Enduro, but I just haven't found a reason to be super excited about the Atlas. There are very few differences between the Atlas and the Enduro, with the exception of the slight design changes to the case. With that in mind, if you already have the Enduro or even the Pro 5, you're probably better off just waiting to see what the next Mobvoi release brings.</p><p>I'm even having a difficult time recommending the Atlas even if you <em>don't</em> have the Pro 5 or the Enduro, simply because the Enduro has been discounted to $279. But unless you <em>really</em> like the differences in the casing, save yourself a few bucks and get the Enduro.</p><p>Hopefully, Qualcomm will release a new wearable chip, giving Mobvoi the opportunity to go back to the drawing board. Heck, if it could re-release the Atlas with a new chip and Wear OS 5, I'd be happy. Well, as long as it meant that I could finally use Google Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>A report claims Google is working to bring a little more video-generation magic to Gemini in an upcoming update.</p><p>As spotted in an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/gemini-app-veo-video-generation/">9to5Google</a>, the company has reportedly started adding code to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> in preparation for Veo 2. The post claims development has been ongoing over the "past several weeks," but the recently spotted code gives a little more to chew on. The publication discovered a description reading that states users will be able to "describe" their idea and "Veo 2 will bring it to life with an 8-second video."</p><p>After generating, similar to having the AI make an image, users may be able to download their AI-generated clip. Additionally, code evidence lends the publication to believe there will be a video player, as well (which would make sense).</p><p>Elsewhere, the post highlights the potential for Google to impose a "limit" on how many videos users can create in Gemini using Veo 2. One string states "You’ve reached your video generation limit until tomorrow." Another mentions the existence of a "monthly limit," too. More information on this is still in the dark, though there's speculation Google could push Veo 2's access behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini's paid tier</a>.</p><p>How this feature will exactly look and work for the end-user wasn't readily available as Google is still likely a bit early on in its development.</p>

<p>In December, after Veo's introduction at I/O 2024, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">debuted Veo 2</a>, which was an updated version of the model that would let users generate "incredibly high-quality" videos. The company stated users could use their imagination and create videos covering a wide range of styles and subjects. The max resolution of Veo 2's videos were reportedly 4K and the AI model even has the capability to understand your complex queries/descriptions.</p><p>Since December, Veo 2 has been placed in Google Labs' VideoFX test and remains there still. Rumors of video-generation arriving in Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-might-be-prepping-ai-video-generation-for-a-future-update">started in February</a>. The early code was much more barebones than what we're seeing reported today; however, it seems Google is still on track to deliver it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google has been slowly stepping more and more into video generation, especially when you consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">YouTube's interest in Veo</a>. A Made by YouTube update in September highlighted the platform's interest in Google's DeepMind AI video-generation software to help its creators. It showcased work toward placing Veo's capabilities in Shorts creation.</p><p>This would generate a six-second clip for creators to use in their Shorts to enhance them with new concepts. Moreover, Google recently rolled out an update for its Vids app, which lets it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-can-now-generate-ai-voiceovers-for-your-videos">create AI-generated voiceovers</a> for your projects.

<p>Google’s lineup of phones is becoming bloated, and I think the company should have merged the Pixel 9 and 9a into one phone and changed specs and pricing options.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">9a launched on March 19,</a> coming with a new design and ditching the usual pill-shaped aluminum camera bar for a flat rear panel. Priced at $499, the phone comes with AI features, including Gemini Live, Add Me, Magic Editor, the Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. <br><br>So, with all of these great features at a fantastic price, why should anyone bother buying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> (starting at $799) when it seems the 9a has similar, if not better, features and is $300 cheaper?</p><p>Like my colleague, Andrew Myrick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">wrote last year</a>, it’s time for Google to rethink its lineup of devices and streamline its offerings.</p><p>And it turns out I'm not the only one who thinks Google needs to revamp its Pixel lineup. So does Android Authority <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-needs-to-rethink-pixel-phones-3535200/">in their recent article</a>. That said, I don't know if I agree that Google should take the iPhone route with its lineup.</p>

<p>I asked Google if there were really enough consumers to justify releasing a Pixel 9 and a 9a, and I was told there was.</p><p>“When we look at our devices, the goal is really to deliver the core Pixel experience and deliver on that incredible camera, the incredible Google AI, and then access to the latest version of Android. [Pixel] 9 is leveling off of those experiences. So there’s a significant boost in image quality, based on the sensors we use in 9, and the capabilities of that camera are quite better than what we have in the A series.”</p><p>“Similarly, from a charging perspective, we find that the 9 serves a user that may be looking for that faster charging experience. And then finally, the display on our 9 devices tends to be of a higher quality than what’s on our A series,” said Shenaz Zack Mistry, senior director of product management for Pixel.</p><p>Google says that there is a user that might want a little more and that from their “portfolio perspective…we have just as many users on that premium tier as we do in our entry tier. So we do believe there’s users in both of those categories.”</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 launched in September 2024, giving consumers at least six months with a phone that has very similar features to the new 9a.</p><p>Per this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9</a> comparison chart, you can see that there are several features that the 9a has that are similar to or even better than the 9, but the phone launches much later than the 9. This means consumers will have to wait for a cheaper phone with Pro-like features and specs.</p>

<p>Senior editor Andrew Myrick made a point when the Pixel launched its 9 series that the company has too many Pixel phones, saying that it might be “a bit overwhelming to some.” Making a similar argument that the A series is priced much lower than the regular base Pixel.</p><p>So, I think Google should have merged the 9 and 9a and offered a much better phone at a reasonable price point somewhere between the two, which would allow Google to still get a great ROI.</p><p>The Pixel 9 is able to perform well because of the higher RAM, and as a result, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features work seamlessly and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, a lacking feature in the 9a. I think the blended phone should have a higher RAM to offer the features the 9a isn’t able to do so, but at the same time, it should still offer the other compromises that keep the phone from performing at a Pro level and, therefore, keeping the price down.</p><p>I personally do not think that many people care about wireless charging, so maintaining wireless charging at the 9a level, in my opinion, is fine and, as a result, does not require more expensive components to increase the cost of the overall phone.</p><p>The blended phone would have the 9a battery size and the same camera features as the 9, but if Google wanted to save on some cost, then using cheaper sensors might be smart, for example.</p><p>Since the processor is the same for both phones, you know the blended phone will still be of top quality.</p><p>The most important thing here is the price of the phone. This merged phone would cost around $600 or $650; the perfect in-between while still keeping it fairly affordable. In fact, if Google needs an example of how to make an affordable flagship-like phone, it only needs to look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r">OnePlus 13R</a>, which offers incredible value and specs for the price.</p>

<p>I know that my reality of what I want from Google may not happen. However, I do think that Google needs to figure out its strategy between the two phones.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees.</p><p>He said in 2024, Pixel shipments grew 5.9%, and in the year prior grew 55.4%. I’m going to guess the increase in sales in 2023 was because of the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, which included Google’s suite of AI features for the first time in a lineup of phones.</p><p>Urbani notes that the share of the Pixel A series has generally been shrinking for the past few years and accounted for 32.1% (almost a third) in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of base Pixel has only trended down slightly while the Pro and Fold versions have gained a share, he said.</p><p>That said, Ubrani notes that while the A series market share is shrinking, there still is a need for the A series because it represents a significant share of Pixels in markets. Assuming the A series continues to shrink in share, Ubrani says that then, in the next few iterations, it may make sense to discontinue it.</p><p>“However, it’s important to realize that the A series doesn’t just bring in a different customer due to the significantly lower price point, it also provides a healthy bump to overall Pixel brand marketing during the year when there’s usually a bit of a slump in the middle of the year,” he said.</p><p>So, if we were to continue with the trajectory of a base Pixel model and one that is part of the A series, then I think Google really needs to figure out a way to differentiate the base model.</p><p>We know from some recent leaks that the Pixel 10 will have a few more upgrades that make it stand out a little more than it has in the past. The biggest potential change is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a triple-camera setup</a>.</p><p>And if Google choses to include that third camera, then it has to make sure that a third camera isn’t also happening in a future Pixel 10a, otherwise, we’ll be back to square one of what is the point of having these two phones.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is teasing something new going on with its Pixel ecosystem later this week overseas.</p><p>The company's Japanese account has started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1903748557318070550">posting teaser images</a> on X of what's to come, beginning with one that spells the date: March 29, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/google-teases-new-pixel-imagination-studio-coming-on-march-29/#more-666177">9to5Google</a>). In this first image, Google provided a photo of "Google Pixel;" however, the "P" in Pixel sports a couple of devilish (or monstrous) horns. Moreover, the post is accompanied by seven emojis, six of them and multicolored hearts with one that's a purple imp.</p><p>Users quickly replied, tossing in their assumptions behind what was being teased, to which they claimed it was BABYMONSTER, a South Korean Girl group (K-Pop).</p><p>Google followed up recently with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1904095846427148558">one more post</a> from its Japanese account with more solid evidence for users' speculation. The machine-translated post says "Monster pop-up coming soon." Additionally, the photo teases something called "Imagination Studio" and the location of the pop-up store in Shibuya, Japan. Google also showcases seven silhouettes at the bottom of its image, which shows off the seven members of BABYMONSTER: Rami, Ahyeon, Chiquita, Asa, Rora, Pharita, and Ruka.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">モンスター級のポップアップ、もうすぐ。#GooglePixel pic.twitter.com/mQkFu3Isye<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904095846427148558">March 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from the images to get people excited, Google didn't offer anything more on what "Imagination Studio" could be. The company also doesn't explain if this studio will be the sole purpose of this pop-up event. The publication speculates it could have something to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a> and its recent ability to "generate images with people." That remains to be seen but, luckily, we don't have to wait that long.</p><p>In the meantime, Google kicked off a collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-is-the-official-smartphone-of-the-australian-open">the Australian Open</a>, becoming its official smartphone in an attempt to reach a more global audience. To celebrate, at the beginning of January, the company set up a real-life Pixel Studio at Rod Laver Arena.

<ul><li>Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be messing up some features on the Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 2.</li><li>Users have reported delayed notifications, inaccurate step counts, battery issues, and more.</li><li>While Google has yet to acknowledge the bugs, restarting or factory resetting the wearable seems to temporarily fix some of the issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The March Wear OS update is rolling out, and it has already started causing some issues for users. The Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be delaying notifications, inaccurately showing steps, causing battery issues, and more (first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-watch-march-2025-update-brings-delayed-notifications-bugs/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Since Mar. 18, Google has been pushing out the Wear OS 5.1 update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Pixel Watch 2, and the original Pixel Watch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/google-lte-pixel-watches-wear-os-5-1-rollout-spotted">broader rollout to LTE watches</a> happened last week, with the LTE Pixel Watch 2 and 3 seeing version <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W3</strong> and the O.G device seeing <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W2</strong> version of the update come in.</p><p>At the start of March, Google announced the feature rollout to wearables, with the new Loss of Pulse and menstrual health support coming to the Pixel Watch 3. Other watches received tweaks to features that improved audio controls, step count tracking, and expansion of auto bed-time mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3061px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5" name="pixel-watch-3-myfitnesspal-app" alt="The MyFitnessPal app on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3061" height="1722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it looks like the patch brought some unexpected bugs as well to these watches. Over the weekend, those who updated their watch to the latest firmware seem to be facing all kinds of issues with their wearables. Several people took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1jhzriq/anyone_else_facing_issues_with_pixel_watch_3/">Reddit</a> to express their frustration about this rather messy update that has made their watches slower than usual.</p><p>Several Pixel Watch 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">Pixel Watch 3 </a>owners reported that notifications seemed to be delayed and were only displayed when the user manually wakes the watch, after which they are flooded by multiple notifications all at once.</p><p>Other users feel that the update has messed up their step counter — the watch seems to be counting steps and detecting floors climbed, even when the user has taken it off. It also seems to be detecting way more steps than usual, according to another user who said they only walked 5K steps, but the watch seems to have tracked about 17K.</p><p>Additionally, these bugs have supposedly started draining the watch's battery. The publication added that some users have been dealing with the watch crashing when all they did was try to change or edit a watch face's complications or colors.</p><p>For now, users on the same Reddit thread seem to have come up with a workaround to solve this issue. They said factory resetting the watch seems to be solving some of these issues, while some feel that simply restarting the watch does the job, but only temporarily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some users thanked the Google gods as they didn't face any of the above issues with the new update. For now, Google hasn't officially acknowledged the issue. However, Android Central has reached out to the company and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>The Nexode Power Bank Genshin Impact Edition is a 2000mAh power bank with three charging ports in total, with a cumulative power budget of 130W. The facade of the power bank has a Kinich-themed design along with K'uhul Ajaw, and it looks pretty distinctive — much more so than the regular model. The sides have Scions of the Canopy and Yumkasaurus graffiti, and the bottom has a pixelized K'uhul Ajaw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3" name="UGREEN Genshin Impact" alt="UGREEN x Genshin Impact collection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is definitely attention-grabbing, and even the USB-C connectors are decked out in green. Thankfully, you still get a panel showcasing real-time charging and battery level, and it makes using it that much more convenient. I used the 20000mAh and 25000mAh Nexode power banks quite a bit in the last six months, and they're now my go-to choice while traveling.</p>

<p>The USB-C1 port hits 100W, with the USB-C2 going up to 30W, and USB-A hitting 22.5W. It does a good job charging up to three devices at once, and I didn't have any problems with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and Vivo X200 Pro. The regular 20000mAh Nexode power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">is down to $63 on Amazon</a>, so you are paying a little extra to get the variant with the Kinich styling. That said, it's still a great choice, and the product itself is identical to the standard 130W model that I've used extensively.</p>

<p>UGREEN's best-selling product is the Nexode 65W charger, so it isn't too astonishing that the brand chose this particular model to get a Genshin makeover. The only issue I have with the Nexode Charger Genshin Impact Edition is that the Nexode Pro is a better choice overall, and the brand should have used that as the foundation instead.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Nexode 65W is still a strong GaN charger, and it has dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port. UGREEN also sells another model with a UK plug, and the small size makes it a good recommendation if you need a travel-friendly charger. The regular Nexode 65W charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Gallium-Nitride-Charger-Black/dp/B091BGMKYS">is down to $25</a>, and the Genshin-styled variant can be bought for $39.</p>

<p>It's great to see Qi2 charging accessories gaining momentum, and this 2-in-1 is effective at charging a phone over Qi2 as well as an accessory. The best part is that it has a USB-C port on the side, so you can charge a third device as well, albeit at 5W.</p>

<p>The design is pretty cool, with the charging stand featuring the Yumkasaurus pattern and Kinich’s Elemental Skill aiming frame. The foldable design is ideal for portability, and it has a good swivel action — I had no issues using it with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The regular product usually costs $38, and the Genshin model is now available for $59.</p>

<p>It's always good to see a colorful USB-C cable, and UGREEN decked out the braided cable in a bright green hue, with a K'uhul Ajaw cable tie and Dendro styling at the connectors. It goes up to 100W over USB PD, and is available in a single 1-meter variant. At $9, it's just as affordable as the regular model.</p>

<p>UGREEN sent the new products in a custom gift box that's designed to look like a loot chest, and it is extravagant. The brand did a brilliant job with the packaging in general; I unboxed limited-edition phones that didn't have anywhere close to this level of attention to detail.</p>

<p>As to why the brand went with Kinich, UGREEN says: "As a skilled Saurian Hunter, Kinich is steady, direct, and efficient in combat. These qualities align with UGREEN’s brand identity and mission. The cobranded products excel in charging speed, providing gamers and users with an efficient and reliable charging experience. Kinich wields the power of Dendro and his character design primarily uses green, aligning with UGREEN’s brand colors. The pixelation in his design also matches with the digital nature of UGREEN's electronics."</p>

<p>In addition to the Genshin Impact-branded accessories, UGREEN bundled a set of add-ons, including a phone grip, power bank pouch, lanyard, and acrylic stands. It definitely makes unboxing the packaging more of an occasion, and I like that all the products have a distinct green styling.</p>

<p>While the packaging is noteworthy in its own right, UGREEN mentions that the Genshin Impact merchandise and the gift box won't be available at retail. However, the brand is running giveaways on its site and social media channels. Overall, UGREEN did all the right things with the collaboration, and while you are paying more solely based on the aesthetics, the products are distinctive to say the least.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp’s new “Layout” feature enables users to share collaged photos as status updates, similar to Instagram’s Stories.</li><li>Users can select from multiple grid options to share up to six photos from their Android gallery.</li><li>The feature is currently hidden and in testing, with a demo showcasing its potential appearance and functionality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp was found testing a new feature that is popular on Meta's other social media platforms like Instagram. The feature allows users to share collaged pics as status updates.</p><p>According to an APK Insight performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-layouts-status-update-apk-teardown-3536549/">Android Authority</a>, the messaging app was seen using a new “Layout” feature, which helps users pick a collage layout to post multiple pictures at once while sharing them as status updates. It is similar to Instagram’s Stories feature as it also supports layout photo sharing format.</p><p>With the new upcoming WhatsApp feature, the aim here is to keep the status updates cleaner than clumsy as is the case now when users want to share multiple photos at once. The Layout feature allows users to share up to six photos at once and they can be picked up from their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>’s gallery, and it additionally provides multiple grid options to choose from.</p>

<p>While currently hidden, the feature's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8TF21z_Xk8U">showcased demo</a> by the publication gives us an idea of how the "Layouts" will supposedly look when it rolls out to the masses shortly.</p><p>Users can head over to the status page and hit the camera icon, which takes them to the phone’s gallery the Layout option should be seen right next to the “voice” and “music” options, and they can add the preferred six photos and choose from the provided grid styles. The final status update screen, however, remains to be seen as the feature is still in the testing phase.</p><p>WhatsApp Status has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-gets-status-liking-feature-and-private-mentions">significant improvements</a> over the past few months. They've started allowing users to like the status updates alongside allowing users to privately mention their friends from the contacts, who can further repost the update as their status update. All these features are also borrowed from Instagram, and the upcoming new one might soon be added to that list.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy users in the U.S. have been waiting for the One UI 7 on their devices as the company announced the stable operating system rollout for April 10 in the region. However, it now seems unlikely as Samsung deleted the announcement post (spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2025/03/21/samsung-us-deletes-one-ui-7-april-rollout-post/amp/">SammyFans</a>).</p><p>Last week, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">said</a> that Galaxy phone users in the U.S. will be receiving the One UI 7 stable build starting April 10 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 handsets. The release date is already delayed by three days as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7">global rollout</a> is intended to happen on April 7, according to a previous announcement from the brand.</p>

<p>The release date was announced through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=usnews&utm_campaign=general">Samsung U.S. newsroom post</a>, which was sadly pulled by the company for reasons unspecified. The page is nowhere to be seen. However, other related newsroom posts indicating an April 7 release date remain intact — except for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/ca/samsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-10-in-canada">Canada blog post</a>, which interestingly has an April 10 release date.</p><p>Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is a highly anticipated update for Galaxy phone users as it brings a host of improvements over the previous iteration. The initial rollout was slated alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a> launch in January this year, but things, however, didn’t materialize. Later, the announcement was confirmed in April with the company releasing the announcement details, as mentioned before.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official rollout of #OneUI7 will start on April 7, bringing a bold new design for greater personalization and control to the user experience.

<p>On the other hand, SammyFans notes that some of the social posts on X indicating the rollout of One UI 7 on the Samsung US account are nowhere to be found. A post dated March 20 still appears to be live on X, however, the attached announcement post link redirects to a “no page found” window.</p><p>It appears Samsung users in the U.S. might have to wait a little bit more than other users across regions — but that isn't anything new.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on the EU Digital Markets Act, which, as of this week, requires Apple to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. Nor can I predict whether or not Apple will subvert or defy the ruling. But I <em>can</em> speak to how transformative this could be for fitness smartwatches — eventually — if Apple is forced to comply.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202512/DMA_100203_1536.pdf" target="_blank">DMA decision on March 19</a> lists out how Apple must provide "effective interoperability" to let any connected device "receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed."</p><p>Third-party watches would receive "background execution" access, so notifications and replies don't require the companion app running in the foreground as an intermediary. They'd also access faster data transfer (aka AirPlay) and settings like Do Not Disturb and priority notifications.</p><p>Apple will, of course, fight this tooth and nail. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632718/europe-digital-markets-act-apple-interoperability-smartwatches">The Verge</a> quotes an Apple spokesperson as saying, "Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape...forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns."</p><p>Just as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">Google failed to comply with the DMA</a>, Apple may decide not to follow the ruling. But let's play out the hypothetical here and envision how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> (and <em>non</em>-fitness watches) could evolve with full iOS and Android access.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-is-the-smartest-fitness-brand-and-it-can-only-do-so-much-2">Garmin is the "smartest" fitness brand, and it can only do so much</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing "Listening" for the new voice assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin represents the rare fitness brand that tries to sell "smart" mainstream watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, with smart assistants, Garmin Pay, and a few third-party apps like Spotify and YouTube Music.</p><p>However, Garmin only pulled off a mini-walled garden of smarts and apps the same way Fitbit did before its Google acquisition. Both brands were so successful that they had the gravity to bring major apps to the bargaining table.</p><p>Garmin also used its higher cash flow to acquire businesses like Firstbeat Analytics and FitPay for a smarter training algorithm and contactless payments. Most fitness brands can't get third-party payment services to support them.</p><p>And because Garmin has an eclectic mix of iPhone and Android customers — its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2024-Q4-GRMN-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf">earnings</a> show more than half of its sales come in Europe and Asia, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are more popular — it supports a couple of basic Android-only smart features, most notably quick replies to Google Messages and the ability to see images in notifications. Apple blocks both (for now).</p><p>But despite all that effort and its advantages, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> isn't that advanced for messaging, turn-by-turn navigation, voice commands, and other tricks you get on watchOS or Wear OS. That applies double to brands like COROS, Polar, Suunto, and Whoop, which lack the same reach or leverage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Pebble watches will be limited when connected to iOS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm excited to try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-devices-core-2-duo-time-2-pebble-watches-launch">new Pebble watches</a>, but former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky had to "set expectations" on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">his blog</a> about how Apple's policies hamstring them. Pebble watches on iOS can't offer to message, mark tasks as done, ignore notifications you've seen on your phone, support background execution, or create their own mini-app store for third-party watch faces and functions.</p><p>In his case, he says upfront that the definitive way to use a Pebble watch is to pair it with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. However, 40% of his interested customers use an iPhone; Apple's ecosystem is too large to simply ignore it.</p><p>Even most of the old Wear OS brands — Samsung Galaxy, Mobvoi TicWatch, and Fossil — were "compatible" with iPhones for years. But they had such limited functionality thanks to Apple's uncompetitive practices that they've mostly given up and turned to Google's semi-walled Wear OS garden to survive, or (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">in Fossil's case</a>) given up on smartwatches.</p><p>They could only "work" on iOS because they had health and fitness tools independent of their blocked smarts. And every other non-Apple watch for iPhones has been funneled down this path.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 3" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I believe that Apple's policies have (unintentionally) helped make smartwatches much stronger for health and fitness across the industry. After Pebble shut down, brands knew they couldn't make creative lifestyle watches without close phone integration for apps and messaging. So they focused on a use case that Apple couldn't restrict and turned a weakness into a strength with low-powered watches that lasted weeks.</p><p>If this ruling takes effect, it would change the entire industry. Yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> would be unleashed to encroach on rival territory. And smaller, health-focused brands like Masimo and Withings suddenly gain access to greater smarts. But we could also see watches that emphasize something <em>other</em> than fitness now that they can.</p><p>The obvious example would be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-leaked-smartwatch-with-brain-signal-tech-would-be-perfect-match">Meta watch</a> with the Meta AI assistant and EMG band for contextual commands and gesture recognition, unrestricted by Apple's policies. But I'd hope to see more indie brands like Repebble shoot their shot and try smart gimmicks that I've never even conceived of without the same pressure to add reliable health data or fitness coaching.</p>
<h2 id="a-distant-and-unlikely-interoperable-future-2">A distant and unlikely interoperable future</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ" name="Four-watches-20-mile-running-test" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2, Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, and Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf together, all showing a post-run summary for a 20-mile race that day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know how much fitness smartwatches will change if Apple obeys this ruling. Yes, background refreshes, closer syncing with your DND settings, interactive replies, and quicker file transfers would benefit any fitness smartwatch. But not every smartwatch is optimized to <em>use</em> messaging.</p><p>They'll need mics for voice-to-text or AMOLED displays with faster touch sampling. This probably wouldn't be possible on watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a>, optimized for long battery life with a slower processor. Maybe Garmin would restrict messaging to its lifestyle watches and prioritize battery life on its Forerunners and Instincts.</p><p>Crucially, Garmin (and other brands) would be able to decide to stick to their strengths instead of Apple deciding for them. If they prioritized faster performance, this would benefit both iOS and Android users; a better chip and more widespread assistant would make RCS messaging better, too.</p><p>Of course, the original point still stands. This isn't like changing from Lightning to USB-C or allowing sideloading; it would fundamentally change the entire operating system, and Apple could spend years disputing the ruling. Then, fitness watches would have to license more robust hardware and test the software. Who knows how long that could take?</p><p>But <em>if</em> it does happen, it would certainly make things more exciting and competitive for smartwatch fans, whichever smartphone they own!</p>

Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan.</p><p>Google <em>loves</em> GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/game-ai-summit-beyond-the-hype-real-world-applications-of-google-ai-in-gaming-presented-by-google/911129">panel</a> on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/adaptive-game-performance-with-samsung-galaxy-presented-by-samsung-electronics/911713">Galaxy panel</a>.</p><p>GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="n7FVgACrRhCezAF3qFYooH" name="GDC-2024-logo.jpeg" alt="A large GDC logo on the show floor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7FVgACrRhCezAF3qFYooH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v74-feature-is-set-to-revolutionize-immersive-experiences">pushed its new passthrough tech</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">reassured devs how profitable their store is</a> — seems pretty telling.</p><p>It's all but guaranteed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> program in May will have workshops on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> — to court 2D <em>app</em> devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal.</p><p>Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular.</p>

<p>The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> headsets more regularly to spend money.</p><p>Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android."</p><p>You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility.</p><p>Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now.

<p>"Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich.</p><p>White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own."</p><p>"XR developers aren't just game developers; they're <strong>3D interaction experts</strong>," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault."</p>

<p>White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth.</p><p>Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful.</p><p>Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/08/analysis-apple-vision-pro-sells-well-but-needs-more-content-faster">sold 500,000 Vision Pros</a>, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets.</p><p>VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it?</p>

<p>Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony-made micro-OLED displays</a> with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side.</p><p>So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game.</p><p>Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't <em>need</em> an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do <em>more</em> than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-headsets-will-take-vital-camera-option-from-android-phones">similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API</a>, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did.</p><p>Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, <em>then</em> Google could prioritize gaming, right?</p><p>Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year.</p><p>Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.</p>

The Meta booth was crowded with hopeful indie devs aiming to join Oculus Publishing or get some of that $50 million Horizon Worlds grant money. But most established publishers didn't pay for booths. Given the current "VR visibility crisis," I found that quite telling.</p><p>On Monday, XR industry vet Jim Squires led a panel called "Solving VR Gaming's Visibility Crisis: Strategies for Reaching Mainstream Audiences," which included the publishers behind Moss and Ghosts of Tabor, a VR marketing CEO, and IGN's executive editor.</p><p>The panel highlighted the major dip in revenue that VR developers are experiencing, both on the Quest Store and other platforms. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">Meta's Oculus Publishing lead addressed this criticism</a> in a later GDC 2025 talk, claiming Meta's store changes had a "very small" impact on developer profits.</p><p>This panel took a different stance, as they explained how the money well and marketing support from these platforms dried up, leaving them to fend for themselves.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the devs behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> are giving up, either. This panel highlighted the new ways developers will try to reach VR gamers, sidestepping the Quest Store or other VR platforms entirely for discoverability.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aUYAHUENVfGA2M7ZKA3nRi" name="Moss-Book-2-Foundry-Screenshot.jpeg" alt="Moss Book 2 gameplay screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUYAHUENVfGA2M7ZKA3nRi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="844" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polyarc)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polyarc publishing director Lincoln Davis shared how Sony initially took them under their wing with incredible publicity and support, recognizing that Moss would exhibit to the masses how cool VR could be.</p><p>Sony took a "shotgun approach," reaching everyone from hardcore gamers to casual non-gamers. Moss got a major E3 slot and was included at road shows, concerts, baseball and football games, store activations, billboards, Black Friday and NFL commercials, and major social media pushes, with on-the-go demos available to show people what the game (and VR) was about.</p><p>Ultimately, Davis estimates they've gotten about $42 million in ad support from publishers across multiple platforms.</p><p>But after those glory days of reach where quality meant attention, the VR platforms wanted "direct measurement" of the "return on investment." These platforms left behind the "three-steps-removed" mainstream crowds while retailers like Gamestop and Best Buy started removing the headsets that let "normal" people try VR for themselves.</p><p>Instead, Sony refocused all its marketing on the serious gamer crowd, which had already had inroads; it generally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either">hasn't given the PSVR 2 the same level of attention</a> as the original, which multiple panelists bemoaned. Meta, meanwhile, prioritized PR for the hardware, or for self-owned games like Beat Saber or Supernatural.</p><p>Of course, as IGN's executive editor Ryan McCaffrey explained, it's "very much an uphill battle" to get their core audience to click on articles about VR games, especially "original IP." Outside of well-known franchises like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3-review">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>, gamers won't engage with VR content. Whether it's Sony or devs themselves, relying on the gaming press to reach your audience may not work.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-to-meta-s-new-policies-2">Adjusting to Meta's new policies</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ruCYWurxHnwPiof8L9xwyb" name="Meta-Quest-3-promo-image-2024-bestsellers" alt="A promo image of the Meta Quest 3 on a grid background surrounded by eight bestselling VR titles in 2024, including Gorilla Tag and Batman: Arkham Shadow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ruCYWurxHnwPiof8L9xwyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Long-time VR developers used to be able to count on prime Quest Store placement at launch to help them reach out to initial customers and build up reviews and momentum. Now, Squires says, store placement is no longer the "be all, end all," and he asked Maeva Sponbergs, head of publishing and CMO at Beyond Frames, how they're reaching out to audiences without being "dependent on" the Quest Store for visibility.</p><p>Sponbergs likened VR's current "discoverability problem" to what happens on Steam, the iOS App Store, and the Android Play Store. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> remain the only viable option for VR devs to make money. However, now that pretty much anyone can put their game on the Quest Store, it's harder for any one game to stand out and earn a piece of the pie, no matter how good it is.</p><p>So now, Beyond Frames has had to "switch over focus really, really quickly, using old and tried methodologies and trying to acquire users off the platform." They looked at everything from Pinterest to Facebook ads to target the older, non-gaming crowd for family-friendly fare while focusing on Reddit and Discord outreach for serious shooters like Ghosts of Tabor.</p><p>Polyarc's Davis agreed that they had to look at both core gamer outreach and unconventional marketing to keep Moss profitable years later. They're paying influencers to share games with younger audiences that don't don't use traditional media to decide what to play.</p><p>And for older audiences, they're actually reaching out to book and wine clubs that might all decide to try games together, leading to "great clickthroughs" and "great comments" for an older title that wouldn't stand out on the store.</p><p>Most interestingly, in my mind, Polyarc, Beyond Frames, and other VR devs formed a "cross-studio collaboration" where they pushed each other's games on social media and storefronts. They even provided major discounts — up to 75% — to their partners' games, without requiring that people buy their games first. It led to a "huge increase in not only revenue but also unit sales."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GJNYDyisYrpd53Ec8itnoV" name="gorilla-tag-screenshot-official-01" alt="An official screenshot of four different players in Gorilla Tag showcasing different outfits and headgear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJNYDyisYrpd53Ec8itnoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The dominance of games like Gorilla Tag could reshape how devs market their titles </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Another Axiom)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>VR devs who got in on the ground floor are struggling with deflated sales, but they still have built-up reputations, old profits, or VC investments to fund new ventures and relationships with the major platforms that they can leverage while they look for alternative profits. A smaller VR studio without critical acclaim and resources will have more of an uphill battle.</p><p>Both IGN's McCaffrey and marketing expert Stephanie Greenall suggested a key way to raise awareness of VR games is to hide the fact that it's virtual to begin with. Devs who don't have a famous IP to rely on need to look for a "hook" that'll attract people's interest and do well in headlines because, otherwise, gamers won't pay attention.</p><p>That's why I suspect we'll see more small developers trying to use TikTok, Twitch, or Instagram to attract the growing teen crowd on Quest headsets, aiming to win over influencers and streamers to get their games on the map.</p><p>I'm also curious if more developers will try to band together to support each other's games. But given the lack of VR devs on the GDC show floor, I'm curious whether some of them will take an every-dev-for-themselves approach, instead.</p><p><em>Update:</em> Polyarc's Davis reached out to clarify that Sony (not Meta) included Moss in NFL ads, and that they provided discount codes to partners' games without requiring purchase first (as I mistakenly suggested). I apologize for the errors.</p>

For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has launched 30% off the Google Pixel Tablet</strong></a> just days away from its Big Spring Sale (March 25th-31st). This deal represents $120 in savings, so it might not be a bad time to pick up your next Pixel device if you were already in the market.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel tablet</a> was highly anticipated upon its release in 2023, and it's remained a staple for those who like the Pixel ecosystem. While it's certainly not a premium tablet, the Pixel tablet upholds the cozy Google look and feel, offering decent performance backed by the Tensor G2 chip and 8GB of RAM. It also includes a 10.95-inch display, and while it's not an AMOLED screen, it still offers pretty bright, vibrant visuals.</p>

With fluid performance and a vibrant 11-inch display, the Pixel tablet lives up to the hype as far as mid-range tablets go.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="367f0391-f9cd-42a5-9b49-bcf573dea84b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you like Pixel devices and need a simple mid-range tablet; you're looking for a tablet that will offer regular software update support; you want another display for controlling Google smart home devices or for integrating with your other Pixel devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a tablet with a headphone jack; you prefer a tablet with smaller bezels or one with first-party accessories; you have extra money to spend and would rather upgrade to a premium productivity or work tablet.</p><p>No surprise here; the Google Pixel Tablet was a pretty easy pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets#section-best-for-pixel-fans">best Android tablet for Pixel fans </a>category. From the smooth, utilitarian One UI to the easy integration with other Pixel devices, there's more than one reason why fans waited so long for this tablet to come out.</p><p>To be sure, the Pixel Tablet isn't a premium-level tablet or one best used for performance-intensive use. However, it comes with a nice 10.95-inch LCD display that remains vibrant and bright (despite not being an AMOLED), and solid performance, as supported by the 8GB of RAM and Google Tensor G2 chip. This particular deal is for the 128GB storage configuration of the tablet, though Google also offers a 256GB version.</p><p>A few downsides include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Google's lack of a first-party stylus or keyboard cover. But for most casual users or those simply looking to add a multi-use screen to their Google smart home, the price point here is certainly worth considering.</p>

Or BlackBerry. Anyway, then came Apple.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">iPhone</a> quickly became the industry standard for smartphones. Without offering any amazing new features, it captivated consumers in a way the existing offerings just couldn't. I spent far too much and chained myself to AT&T to get one, and there's a good chance you did, too.</p><p>This did not last. Someone at Google had the idea to try and make the smartphone more accessible to people who didn't want to or simply couldn't spend an arm and a leg with Android, and everything changed. Today, depending on the exact time of year, eight of every 10 new phones sold are powered by Android, but Apple makes more money than almost every other phone maker combined.</p>

<p>We're about to see this happen all over again with wearables. In fact, it has already begun. Last year wasn't a great year for wearable sales (or any other goods, it seems), but it was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-gains-as-apple-watch-declines-2024-global-smartwatch-shipments#viafoura-comments" target="_blank">particularly bad year for Apple</a>.</p><p>That doesn't mean Apple lost money, but it does mean the company saw its share of the market fall while competitor sales increased ever-so-slightly. Nor does it mean that Apple's watchOS and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> aren't a smashing success because the company surely made more pure profit for each watch sold than any other company could dream of doing.</p>
<p>Again, this is exactly what happened with the smartphone. Very few people bought the first Android phones. Then Motorola and HTC made some headway (with the help of U.S. carriers), and the gap narrowed until places were switched. Somehow, Apple still makes more money, even today, thanks to a supernatural manipulation of the supply chain and the idea that Android phones are for "poor" people in North America.</p><p>This is how wearables are going to play out, too. The Apple Watch is yet another product Apple makes obscene amounts of profit per unit because it's good at business, and people in the U.S., Canada, and a few enclaves around the world will rush out to buy another one the minute it's available. Basic math tells you selling 100 things and making $10 for every one of them is more than selling 200 things and only making $2 from each.</p>

<p>None of that matters to me, and none of it should matter to you. I want to love a wearable but have a hard time doing it, and when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">I do wear one</a>, it runs Garmin's <del>goofy</del> proprietary software, not Wear OS or watchOS. It's the one I like more than the others, and what you like is never going to matter to me. You need to do the very same thing and use whatever you like without caring what I think or which company makes more money.</p><p>It's also just the way both Apple and Google like it. One company wants numbers sold while the other wants profits per. Of course, Apple loved selling more watches than Samsung, but it loves the bottom line just as much.</p>
<p>This all weirdly makes sense. If you have 30 companies each selling a good product that people want, collectively, they will sell more than a single company that sells a similar, yet different, product. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a>, like Android, is a commodity like corn or crude oil that other companies use to create their own product. WatchOS is not and only available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a>. A company trying to do it alone will never be the market leader when it comes to sales.</p><p>As long as Apple can capture customers in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field#:~:text=Reality%20distortion%20field%20(RDF)%20is,new%20world%20through%20mental%20force." target="_blank">reality distortion field</a> and keep them buying expensive products and accessories to use with them, it will do just fine. Marketing is an incredible tool and Apple is the master at wielding it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Enjoy your smartwatch</a>, no matter who makes it.</p>

<p>I’m probably the only person on the Android Central staff that has not owned an iPhone.</p><p>I’ve expressed my interest in buying an iPhone a few times, much to the surprise of my friends and family. It grew mostly out of a desire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-should-release-another-ipod-touch">Apple to bring back the iPod Touch</a>, which it clearly has no interest in doing. I would frankly prefer <em>not </em>to commit to a whole-ass iPhone in order to get the iOS experience. However, if I must, then I would prefer not to spend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> amounts of money to do it, even if it’s the most intriguing device of the bunch.</p><p>So, I decided that I would wait for the iPhone 16e. At the time, I assumed it would fall under the iPhone SE moniker, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-iphone-se-is-tempting">the 2022 model was enticing as an iPod Touch replacement</a>, I figured I could hold out for the next model.</p><p>As the years went by, rumors would emerge about what the iPhone 16e would be. That included talk of an OLED display (finally) and a more modern design. Conflicting rumors went back and forth on whether it would have a notch or Dynamic Island, but it <em>seemed</em> like the iPhone 16e would be the cheap iPhone of my dreams.</p><p>And for a quick second, it was. Kind of.</p>

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> launched, I found myself quite perplexed and at odds over the choices Apple made.</p><p>Sure, it has an OLED display for richer blacks and better contrast, but the display is stuck at 60Hz. I don’t remember the last time I used a phone with that refresh rate, and I regularly review the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> from companies like Motorola, phones that easily cost half the price of the iPhone 16e. Even the $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> has a 120Hz OLED panel, which looks great, I might add.</p><p>Then, there’s the camera. Singular. The iPhone 16e has a single rear camera on the back, which is kind of unacceptable for a $600 phone. I’m not saying Apple should stick four cameras on the phone just for the sake of having multiple cameras, but the lack of even a secondary sensor is perplexing.</p><p>Nearly everything about the iPhone 16e was telling me not to buy it. Even Harish Jonnalagadda says in his iPhone 16e review that it's "a good phone, but a bad value right now." However, with it currently being the most affordable “new” iPhone that I can buy, I was close to pulling the trigger… that is, until the Pixel 9a launched.</p><p>The 9a pretty much affirmed my apprehensions: Apple doesn’t really know how to do value.</p>

<p>I’m not the biggest fan of Pixel phones, but I can’t deny that they’re some of the best phones you can buy. That’s why I wasn’t surprised to see that Google pretty much nailed the Pixel 9a. Based on the specs and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> from Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks, the phone feels like everything the iPhone 16e should’ve been.</p><p>The phone has a larger OLED display that’s more than 2x brighter and with a faster 120Hz refresh rate. It features a secondary 13MP camera for ultrawide shots, something (I learned from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>) I realized I can’t really go without.</p><p>You also get a faster USB standard on the Pixel, and while I can’t speak to battery life just yet, the 5,100mAh battery and 30+ estimation from Google sounds pretty good compared to the 4,005mAh unit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/">found in the iPhone 16e</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple has also been fumbling its AI rollout, delaying its long-awaited Siri upgrade. Meanwhile, Google has been going full-stream ahead with Gemini, to the point where it’s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">prepping to replace the tried-and-true Google Assistant</a> later this year. The Pixel 9a won’t have every feature from the Pixel 9, and not all AI features will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">processed on-device</a>, but Google’s software and AI are pretty solid, with plenty of fun features for Pixel 9a users to take advantage of.</p><p>I’ll also mention that you get more interesting color options with the Pixel, which is more than I can say for the rather bland black or white iPhone 16e.</p><p>This is all for a phone that costs $100 <em>less</em> than the iPhone 16e.</p>

<h2 id="the-iphone-16e-still-as-some-good-things-going-for-it-2">The iPhone 16e still as some good things going for it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s not to say the iPhone 16e doesn’t have some pretty compelling specs. The A18 chip is mighty impressive and is probably much more performant than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. And despite having just one camera, I've always been impressed with Apple's imaging, and it looks like it still takes great images and videos, even if you miss the option to take wider shots.</p><p>There’s no doubt Apple’s FaceID is a superior facial authentication method (although I do prefer fingerprint sensors), and the Action Button is a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">I would like to see on more phones</a>.</p><p>Aesthetically, the iPhone 16e just looks a lot better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">new camera housing on the Pixel 9a</a> just looks awkward.</p><p>You also get more storage options with the iPhone 16e, going all the way up to 512GB. The downside is that it will obviously cost you much more, with the 128GB iPhone priced $100 higher than the 128GB Pixel 9a.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16a are both affordable ways to get hold of some of the latest hardware and software on both Android and iOS. If you’re already baked into one OS and holding onto a previous A-series Pixel or iPhone SE, then these may be worth upgrading to. They’re also good ways to bring in younger family members without breaking the bank on a new phone.</p><p>Harish says the iPhone 16e is aimed at "older iPhone users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware," and this could also be said for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>That said, it feels like the Pixel 9a is a much better deal, with mostly better specs and a lower price tag for someone looking to save money on a new phone. Even if you’re an iPhone user, if you don’t have any allegiance to iOS, this is a phone worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>As for me, maybe I’ll just wait until Apple releases an iPhone 17e or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/former-iphone-users-discuss-interest-in-apple-foldable">iPhone Flip</a>.</p>

While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.</p><p>For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. It also arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model (4700mAh). The device gets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, the new Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. It comes with an extended battery life of up to 30 hours, faster charging, and two new colorways: Iris and Peony. Starting at $499, it has a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera.</p><p>But what about Pre-orders, you ask? Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-does-the-right-thing-by-delaying-pixel-9a-pre-orders">but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a.</a> Google said in an email that the device will be going on sale sometime in April without an exact date of sale. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a "component quality issue" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: "We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices."</p>

Legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies so that they don't favor their products over other players on the market— leveling the playing field for other tech companies.</p><p>The report claimed two things: First, Google Search showed results favoring Google at the top of the results page rather than similar services offered by third parties. Second, app developers who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers."

Folks in the U.S. have to wait for another three days post-launch, aka April 10,  to be able to see the update pop up on their devices.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_4396080460231991821&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fsamsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-7&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Fsamsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">announcement post</a>, the first set of devices that will be lucky enough to experience the OS are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. While other eligible devices will see a gradual rollout post-launch "in the coming weeks."</p>

Pebble's founder, Eric Migicovsky, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches" target="_blank">a new blog post</a> announced the arrival of two new smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, "Core Devices." Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with "thousands of your beloved Pebble apps."</p><p>Time 2 is a 1.5-inch e-paper display watch that will deliver "less glare and reflections" than its older watches. It has a  53% larger display with 88% more pixels,  the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices had given the watch an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker. The Time 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">available for pre-orders </a>for $225.</p><p>The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, which the company says is identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. This smartwatch features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display with a lightweight polycarbonate frame and three physical buttons. Like Time 2, Core Devices states it is "targeting" an IPX8 water-resistant rating. For $149, it includes a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.</p>

<ul><li>Google Vids is adding the ability to create AI-generated voiceovers for your projects.</li><li>You could already use AI to create videos and sample scripts in Google Vids.</li><li>Now, you can form an entire project — video, scripts, and audio — with AI in Google Vids.</li></ul>

<p>Google Vids is a relatively new Google Workspace service that uses AI and Gemini to create videos and presentation from scratch. It's intended to be a more practical alternative to other video-generation tools, prioritizing work and school applications such as presentations, slideshows, and other types of content delivery methods. Now, Google is expanding Vids' AI capabilities with the ability to generate voiceovers, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com" target="_blank">announced</a> this week.</p><p>After creating a video with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">Google Vids</a>, the "Help me Create" feature made it possible to generate a voiceover script with AI. The latest update takes things a step further, using AI to narrate the previously-generated script. Google notes the following as benefits to using Help me Create to make AI voiceovers:</p>
<ul><li>"Eliminate the manual effort of recording 'the perfect take'"</li><li>"Gain easy access to a variety of voiceovers that provide you with professional-sounding video narration"</li><li>"Save time matching voiceovers to scenes in your video with automatic audio to scene alignment"</li></ul>

<p>After generating a sample script and AI voiceover, you can edit the script and voiceover with ease, so you aren't locked into one generation. There are different tone and pitch options to choose from, as well as unique voices. The script and voiceover options will only appear through Help me Create after opening or creating a Google Vids project.</p><p>The feature is only available to paid Google Workspace customers on the following plans:</p>
<ul><li>Business Standard and Plus</li><li>Enterprise Standard and Plus</li><li>Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus</li><li>Education Plus</li><li>Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education or Education Premium add-ons</li></ul>
<p>AI-generated voiceovers are rolling out now in Google Vids, but it could take 15 days from the feature's initial release (March 20) for the functionality to appear for everyone.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is the first to support Instant Hotspot.</li><li>Google's Instant Hotspot feature is part of Cross-device Services, a set of features designed to make Android devices work together.</li><li>Older Samsung phones could only use the Auto Hotspot feature, exclusive to Galaxy phones and tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on building up the Android platform into a true ecosystem of devices that work better together, including Android phones, Android tablets, and Wear OS watches. Part of that effort involves Cross-device Services, a set of Android features that help multiple devices seamlessly connect. However, the point is moot if Android manufacturers don't buy in, and historically Samsung Galaxy devices prioritize their own ecosystem features rather than the broader Google ones.</p><p>That was the case with hotspot tethering, as Samsung phones supported an Auto Hotspot feature that automatically connected with Samsung tablets. Now, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, Google's Instant Hotspot feature is supported for the first team. Leveraging Android's Cross-device Services, this means that Samsung Galaxy phones can instantly tether their hotspot to any Android tablet.</p><p>The move was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-instant-hotspot-3537161/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which noticed the new toggle appear in the Settings app on the Galaxy S25 series. To use it, navigate to the <strong>Cross-device Services </strong>tab in Settings, tap <strong>Internet Sharing</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Instant Hotspot </strong>toggle is flipped on. After that, Instant Hotspot will work with Android tablets and Chromebooks that are signed into the same Google account as your Galaxy S25.</p>

<ul><li>A leak on X claims Motorola is looking to deliver a wooden finish for its Razr Plus 2025.</li><li>The leaked rendering doesn't give enough details about the authenticity of the device's proposed wood finish.</li><li>The Moto X was a truly unique phone with a real wood finish, which Motorola similarly for the Edge 50 Ultra in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new design leak for Motorola's upcoming foldable surfaced and shows off a unique aesthetic choice.</p><p>The latest leak concerns the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 as a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1902755397183635565">Evan Blass on X</a> showcased a rendering of a potential design choice for consumers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/21/wood-backed-motorola-razr-60-ultra-surfaces-in-leaked-video/">9to5Google</a>). Curiously, all the tipster says is "Ultra" in the post, which likely refers to its international name, the Razr 60 Ultra. Meanwhile, what the rendering shows off is a wooden finish for the back of the upcoming Razr Plus. It's a lighter wood with the Motorola "M" symbol in its center and the Razr name right beneath it.</p><p>There are some uncertainties about this finish, most notably about its authenticity. From the rendering video, it's not clear if Motorola is leaning toward <em>real </em>wood or if this is a type of faux wood. As the publication also notes, the rendering shows the rear panel as glossy. That doesn't exactly scream real wood unless Motorola is giving the next Razr Plus the same polishing treatment you would give flooring in your home.</p><p>That could just be for a more interesting viewing experience or it could truly reflect the nature of the panel. The tipster also gave a few brief looks at three more color options for the Razr Plus this year.</p>

<p>If this leak is accurate, it wouldn't be the first time Motorola dropped such an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">unconventional finish</a> like wood before. Over a decade ago, the company dropped the Moto X, which provided consumers with the choice of several wood grains for its rear panel.</p><p>Since then, Motorola has provided wood backing on devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-april-20-2024#:~:text=Motorola%27s%20new%20flagship%20is%20made%20from%20wood">the Edge 50 Ultra from 2024</a>. The company dropped three phones, each with a unique set of finishes that broke the norm. Consumers could purchase them with either a wood grain back or a vegan leather finish.</p><p>There's a chance Motorola could chase a similar theme this year as a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look">leaked Razr Plus 2025 renders</a> showcased it with a faux leather back. Aside from that, the device looked relatively similar to what we've gotten these past couple of years. It seems Motorola could continue to provide a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen. Other rumors claim the OEM could finally step up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-charging-adapter-strength-database">wired charging game</a> and give the Razr Plus 2025 68W wired charging support.</p><p>More importantly, there's speculation that the foldable could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">launch sooner</a> this year, potentially in April.</p>

<ul><li>Epic is offering weekly free games for Android users through the Epic Games Store on mobile.</li><li>The company also added nine more titles to the Epic Games Store for Android in the last month.</li><li>Currently, users can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist for free until March 27.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic brought its popular PC game marketplace, the Epic Games Store, to mobile, and it's bringing the famous free games program to iOS and Android too. The company first announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">monthly free games for the Epic Games Store</a> on mobile starting in January 2025. Now, there are weekly free games available on iOS and Android starting today, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/super-meat-boy-forever-eastern-exorcist-for-free-on-epic-games-store-on-mobile" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>User can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist from the Epic Games Store on those platforms until March 27, free of charge. Those titles join the Epic-made free titles that are always available, like Fortnite and Rocket League. In the past, Epic offered games such as Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, but that offer expired last month.</p><p>To install the Epic Games Store on Android, you'll need to sideload it onto your device. That means navigating to Epic's website, downloading the APK, and completing the installation process. In all, the company says it takes 12 steps for an Android user to download and run the Epic Games Store. It's a lot different than using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-off-samsung-galaxy-store-notifications">Samsung Galaxy Store</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A" name="Epic-Games-Store-Mobile-Update" alt="A graphic for the Epic Games Store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, it may be worth it, especially if you like free Android games. Plus, the Epic Games Store continues to add more games and features as it builds up its game marketplace. Earlier this year, Epic added a few essential desktop features to the mobile version — persistent account login across games and auto-functionality.</p><p>Additionally, the company added nine games to the Epic Games Store for Android in the past month:</p>
<ul><li>Bowling Clash</li><li>Endling - Extinction is Forever</li><li>Chicken Police - Paint it RED</li><li>One Hand Clapping</li><li>Neighbours back From Hell</li><li>This is The Police</li><li>This is The Police 2</li><li>This Is The President</li><li>Through the Darkest of Times</li></ul>
<p>Time will tell if free games will be enough to sway Android users away from the Google Play Store, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">because Google's option isn't perfect</a>. For now, users can expect at least one free game each week on the Epic Games Store for Android.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly started developing a new "Parallel Module Loading" change in Android that will affect the Pixel 10.</li><li>An Open Source Project post shows this "loading process" change will reduce the Pixel 10's loading time by 30%.</li><li>Previous Pixel 10 rumors mention Google's Pixie AI assistant, as well as a gallery of leaked renderings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted making a software change that could positively impact the performance of the next flagship Pixel.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-10-startup-performance-3537302/">Android Authority</a>), Google recently brought attention to an Android Open Source Project change tested for a couple of devices. The source code change is called "Parallel Module Loading." Aside from the technical jargon, the root of the change reads "Pixel 10 reduces 30% loading time."</p><p>Testing was also reportedly conducted on Google's Pixel Fold, in which it resulted in a 25% overall reduction.</p><p>Rahman adds that a 30% reduction in loading time will likely affect the phone's startup performance — notably its loading time. Specifically, they state this software upgrade will impact the "early part of the Android OS’s multi-stage initialization process." With a quicker process taking place, it <em>seems </em>that Google will make its next flagship models (and the Fold) load faster. However, Rahman notes that it's unclear if this change will quicken its overall startup.</p><p>Given the fact that this test showed up recently in March, there's speculation that Google could see this as a perfect addition to a future Android 16 update.</p>

<p>Rumors about the Pixel 10 are just getting started as one from earlier in March speculated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">about a new AI assistant</a>. Internal sources claim Google will debut "Pixie," a new Pixe-exclusive assistant in the next flagship series. This AI will be popped into an app that will bring cross-communication capabilities between a user's downloaded apps. Pixie will also process a user's metadata to "predict" actions for them.</p><p>Google reportedly confirmed, "It will also be able to suggest places, products, and names, right when you need them."</p><p>Something more to chew on surfaced ten days ago: a small gallery of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">alleged Pixel 10 renderings</a>. From what a tipster highlighted, it seems Google isn't preparing to introduce a vast amount of hardware changes — if any at all — for the Pixel 10 series. The leak showcased three devices: the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The trio's images sported the exact same design with rounded corners and flat edges as the Pixel 19 series we have today.</p><p>However, one major assumption is that the base Pixel 10 could grab an additional lens, taking it up from a dual array to a triple.</p>

<p>I'm what some would call a "specs snob." Meaning that I want the latest, greatest, and most powerful device that I can get my hands on. After years of reviewing phones and devices that nobody should use but everyone bought, I (mostly) decided that enough was enough. It also doesn't help that around the time I made that personal decision, I got my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 2.</p><p>So when I saw that Google announced the Pixel 9a, I just read the headlines and just kept it moving. It wasn't until I read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">excellent hands-on</a> from Android Central's very own Michael Hicks that I started to look a bit deeper into what the 9a had to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-cameras" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right), the 8a slightly overlapping the 9a corner. The photo focuses on the 9a's new camera cutout compared to the 8a's camera bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get this out of the way, I don't like Google's decision to remove the camera bar. It's been a staple of the Pixel lineup since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and while I haven't said this out loud, I was also disappointed when it was removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Now, colors notwithstanding, the Pixel 9a just blends in with the sea of rectangles that everyone uses.</p><p>Anyways, on paper, the Pixel 9a is practically the perfect phone for the majority of people. Do you need an all-day battery life? The 9a delivers a 5,100mAh battery, paired with a larger vapor chamber for better cooling, which, in turn, should mean the Tensor G4 has a bit more room to breathe. Oh, and by the way, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">Google claims</a> these two changes are the reasons why the camera bar was sliced off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of performance, the Tensor G4 is in the cockpit, with 8GB of LPDDR5X riding shotgun. That sounds great, right? Actually, yeah, I think it sounds pretty darn good. What's that? You don't get Pixel Screenshots or Call Notes? Oh well.</p><p>Apparently, this is because Google is using an "extra extra small" Gemini Nano model. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a>, Google confirmed that this model has other limitations, such as "the lack of multimodality—Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS is <em>text-only</em>."</p><p>Normally, I would put on my Jerry hat and be irritated that Google didn't figure out a way to include features that should be staples across the entire lineup. So why am I sitting here feeling the complete opposite?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g" name="pixel-9-ai.jpg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because this is the exact problem that Google needed to solve.</p><p>Flashback to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> release, and you would have a hard time convincing me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> was actually the better phone. With the exception of the camera hardware and camera features, the Pixel 8a offered practically the same experience while costing $200 less.</p><p>With the Pixel 9a, there are quite a few differences, but Google managed to drop the less important features while providing some sound reasoning as to why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1910px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="PzyV7AF5XzsSxQG8R5xyoQ" name="google-pixel-9a-mockup" alt="Google Pixel 9a mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzyV7AF5XzsSxQG8R5xyoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1910" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a still lets you enjoy the fruits of Gemini's labor, but it just might not be as fast and can't handle anything other than text. It's not equipped with the best camera that Google offers, but the 48MP main lens still sounds pretty darn good, and you aren't losing out on Google's image processing.</p><p>Sure, it has a larger screen and bigger battery than its brethren, but the camera bar is gone, and the bezels are massive. On top of that, the Pixel 9 features an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-just-dont-work-for-me">some would argue</a> that an optical sensor is better anyway. Personally, I just think Google needs to embed it in the power button, but what do I know?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, instead of getting 95% of what the more expensive version has, you get something closer to 85% or maybe 90%. All while paying $200 less and coming in a dollar short of the $500 imaginary line in the sand.</p><p>But what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a>? Yeah? What about it? Apple might have beaten both Google and Samsung to the punch with a new mid-range phone, but the iPhone 16e also costs $100 more and falls short in a lot of ways.</p><p>If you don't believe me, just check this out:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, today Google launched the Pixel 9a, and it continues to show how much of an embarrassment the iPhone 16e is.Here’s everything the Pixel 9a has over the iPhone 16e, despite being $100 cheaper:– Blue and pink color choices– 6.3” display vs 6.1”– 120 Hz vs 60 Hz– 2,700… pic.twitter.com/Vj75GqF1JV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902396486018580494">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Which reminds me, if you're feeling sour or betrayed by Google leaving out some Gemini features, just remember that Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/">can't even tell you what month it is</a>. No, I'm not kidding.</p><p>For years, if someone asked me to recommend the best phone for $500, I'd probably have told them to either wait for a deal or just get an iPhone. Even if that meant getting the last-gen iPhone SE, which still had the physical home button. That's no longer the case, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple continues to stumble</a> and fall harder and harder while Google keeps mosying on along. As such, if you asked me that same question today, I'd tell you to quit talking to me and pre-order one already.</p><p>There's just something about the Pixel 9a that feels comfortable, and that's coming from someone who hasn't actually used one yet. Not only that, but the Pixel 9a might be the first Android phone that I would feel good about giving to an older family member. The peace of mind of being able to hand someone a phone and absolve yourself from being the dedicated tech support rep makes the Pixel 9a worth every penny and probably more.</p>

<ul><li>A report "confirms" the Google Pixel 9a features a "limited" version of AI called Gemini Nano XXS.</li><li>The Pixel 9a only features 8GB of RAM, which isn't enough to support the bulk of Google's larger, fancier AI features, thus the even smaller version of Gemini.</li><li>During its launch, Google said the Pixel 9a supports Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest Pixel is more affordable and, according to recent reports, it features a less powerful version of the company's AI, too.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a> confirms Google's Pixel 9a runs a much smaller, less resource-chasing version of its AI called "Gemini Nano XXS" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9a-gemini-not-powerful-rest-of-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). The publication states this "limited" version of Gemini Nano takes center stage because of the Pixel 9a's low amount of available RAM: only 8GB. As a result, research shows the Pixel 9a doesn't contain <em>all </em>of the AI features Pixel consumers might've become accustomed to/seen with the recent Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The post says the device doesn't sport features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a>. Additionally, it notes "Google doesn't call out missing features on the product page," meaning more testing is required to know the full extent of the missing Gemini features the Pixel 9a lacks.</p><p>These two prominent features are missing from the Pixel 9a because of the audio and video processing functions required. The publication says Gemini Nano XXS simply can't do what's required to run these two AI features, so they've been left out.</p><p>The Pixel 9a still has some useful AI features like Recorder app text summaries. Due to its low available RAM (a resource heavily sought after for on-device AI), the Gemini Nano XXS model is said to "only load when the model is needed." As a result, users may notice some other functions become a little less reliable when calling on Gemini for AI assistance. If the model ran continuously in the background users likely wouldn't have the capability of doing much — at least not well.</p>

<p>Speaking of its supported AI features, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">the Pixel 9a launched</a> earlier this week, Google highlighted a few of them. The company stated the device contains features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, "and more." Considering the last three choices, these all revolve around photography. If Gemini Nano XXS only surfaces "when needed," those features would fit the bill.</p><p>A few other features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Call Assist were also mentioned.</p><p>Google likely had to make some changes to ensure the Pixel 9a would remain in the "budget realm," kind of like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">past-gen modem</a>. The company recently confirmed that the Pixel 9a utilizes the older Exynos 5300 modem, which lacks satellite connectivity support. Moreover, the modem is overall less powerful compared to the newer Exynos 5400 inside the other Pixel 9 series phones (with satellite connectivity).</p><p>There's some additional concern about this choice considering, in 2023, the Exynos 5300 was popped into the Pixel 8 series, which gave users quite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">mobile data headache</a>. Not only was their reception questionable, but the modem seemingly affected the series' battery as users saw severe draining issues.</p>

The aluminum design, page turn buttons, and high-quality E Ink panel made it a standout choice, but annoyingly, Amazon doesn't sell the product any longer, and there isn't a viable alternative — the brand is instead focusing on note-taking devices like the Scribe. <br><br>This was problematic as the battery life of my Kindle Oasis isn't anywhere close to what it used to be; I still get a few days out of a charge, but I couldn't reliably use it on the road. As I started heading back to events, I wanted another e-reader that was up to the task, and that's where I came across the Kobo Libra Colour. <br><br>Kobo's latest e-reader nails the basics; it has a 7-inch E Ink panel, adjustable warm light, and physical page turn buttons — all the features that made me like the Kindle Oasis. As a bonus, the e-reader has USB-C connectivity, and Libby/Overdrive integration. <br><br>I switched to the Libra Colour at the start of the year, and after three months of extensive use involving travel to three countries and reading over a dozen books, I'm convinced — this is the ideal upgrade to the Kindle Oasis.</p>

<p>Kobo unveiled the Libra Colour in April 2024, and the e-reader is available globally. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z">costs $229 on Amazon</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour">Rakuten store</a>, and you can get your hands on the e-reader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof-White/dp/B0CZXWGK79">in the U.K. for £209</a>. It debuted in India back in October 2024, and is available in the country for ₹19,999 ($231).</p>

<p>Kobo did a good job with the design of the Libra Colour, and it feels great to hold and use. Just like the Kindle Oasis, the Libra Colour has physical page turn buttons, but they're on the left. There's a raised edge on the left that makes it easier to hold the e-reader, and the back is flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Oasis, the Libra Colour has a plastic back, and while it doesn't quite have the same premium feel, there are no issues with the build quality. Coming in at 199g, the Libra Colour is 11g heavier than the Oasis, but the difference isn't noticeable in daily use. And while it has a plastic back, there is an interesting floral motif at the back that makes holding the device just that little easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The raised edge houses the USB-C port, and it's great to be able to use an e-reader that uses the same charging port as my phone. This was a constant source of frustration with the Kindle Oasis, and Amazon really should have introduced a model with USB-C connectivity. Thankfully, that isn't an issue on the Libra Colour.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the white color variant of the e-reader, and it looks a little more distinctive than the standard black model. The e-reader has built-in sensors that change the orientation of the screen according to whatever hand you're holding it in, and the location of the page turn buttons is ideal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The buttons are easily accessible with your thumb, and have good tactility. If anything, the buttons proved to be a bit too stiff in the beginning, but they're better to use now. Having physical buttons makes all the difference on an e-reader, and I can't go back to using one without it. A cool feature is the ability to invert the buttons; by default, the bottom button is used to go to the next page in a book, but you can easily switch it to the top button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one issue I have with the design is the power button; it's located at the back, and it's inconvenient to access most of the time. Thankfully, pressing the page turn buttons wakes the device, so that's what I've been doing. While it isn't a problem as such, I don't like that the panel doesn't sit flush with the body; this is another area where the Oasis wins out. <br><br>Outside of that though, I can't find anything to fault with the Libra Colour. It may not have quite the same in-hand feel as the Oasis, but it is just as reliable in daily use, and it holds up incredibly well during travel.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining feature on the Libra Colour is the 7-inch panel, and unlike every other e-reader I used until now, it does a great job rendering colors. It's made possible by use of E Ink's Kaleido 3 panel, and it has good color saturation thanks to 4,096 colors. The resolution of the panel is 1680 x 1264, with a pixel density of 300PPI — just like the Kindle Oasis — with monochrome text and 140PPI when it comes to content in color.</p>

<p>It's enjoyable to use an e-reader with a color panel, and it's a technical achievement in and of itself. Because of the way E Ink panels work, there's no backlight powering the display, and it's instead illuminated by LEDs on the side. While this isn't an issue with black and white text — it looks just as clean as other e-readers — it is noticeable when viewing things like comics and book covers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a noticeable grain to the colors, and because of the inherent nature of E Ink, you don't get the same color vibrancy as LCD or OLED panels — that's just the way the tech works. So if you're looking to get the Libra Colour to read comics, know that it still does a decent job in this area as it integrates the CBZ and CBR extensions, but color quality won't be anywhere as good as an Android tablet like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a>.</p>

<p>The E Ink panel by itself does a good job curbing blue light emissions, and I had no problems using the Libra Colour all day. It uses Kobo's ComfortLight Pro tech, so you get adjustable warm light in addition to the regular white LED lighting, and it definitely makes a difference — particularly when reading at night. On that note, there's dark mode as well, and while I use the mode extensively on my monitor and phones, I prefer reading books without it. <br><br>Basically, this is one of the best panels you can get today, and it makes using the Libra Colour that much more engaging.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is a delight to use; it's comfortable to hold throughout the day, and the 7-inch panel size is ideal to read books. The E Ink panel itself is terrific, with good pixel density and clarity. I didn't see any issues with ghosting — where afterimages of previous pages are retained when you refresh — and the interface is just as fluid as the Kindle Oasis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with navigation, and page turns are handled smoothly while reading a book. Obviously, a big draw is the physical page turn buttons, and they make using the Libra Colour that much more enjoyable. While I didn't use it to read comics, it's fun to be able to view book covers in color, and that novelty doesn't go away. What I also like is that the device lets you put the cover on the lock screen when it's idling, and that's a nice addition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is available in a single configuration with 32GB of storage, and considering most ebooks are less than 1MB in size, the storage isn't a problem with sizable collections. It isn't an issue even if you want to read comics on the device, and while the color panel doesn't have the best resolution, it is a decent choice in this regard. Similarly, you can listen to audiobooks by connecting a Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>The e-reader has a 2050mAh battery, and in my usage, it easily lasted two weeks between charges. That's less than what I got with the Kindle Oasis (back when it's battery didn't degrade), but the color E Ink panel needs more power, and the convenience of charging over USB-C more than offsets any issues around battery longevity. Charging the e-reader takes over an hour and a half as it is limited to 10W, and it didn't exceed 7W when connected to a standard 100W USB PD charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the software is the customizability. There's integration with cloud storage providers, so you can easily download books from Google Drive if that's what you prefer. You can also easily load custom fonts on the device, and the built-in selection in itself is extensive. I've gotten used to Amazon's Bookerly font over the last decade, and it was a breeze to install it on the e-reader. <br><br>You can also easily annotate and highlight books, and this is particularly handy thanks to the color E Ink panel. There's also the ability to journal and take notes, but you'll need to pick up the Kobo Stylus to do that. I have a dozen styli in the house, but none of those — even the ones paired with Onyx and Remarkable readers — connected to the Libra Colour, so I wasn't able to test this feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's IPX8 ingress protection, and you can use the Libra Colour in the tub or at the pool without any issues. Finally, if you use Libby, you can get the books onto the Libra Colour and read without too much of a hassle, and that's another area where the e-reader wins out against the Kindle Oasis. <br><br>In general, the Libra Colour does a better job with DRM-free e-books than any of Amazon's e-readers, and it's refreshing to see. Kobo's ebook store isn't anywhere as extensive as the Kindle Store, but you can easily grab books from any storefront and read on the Libra Colour as it has native EPUB, EPUB3, FlePub, PDF, and MOBI integration.</p>

<p>As good as the Kindle Oasis has been, it's clear that Amazon has no intention of delivering a successor to the product. Thankfully, there are other alternatives around; I like what Onyx is doing with its e-readers, and the BOOX Go Color 7 is a decent choice. <br><br>It has the same E Ink Kaleido 3 panel as the Libra Colour, adjustable warm light, and higher 64GB of storage. You get physical page turn buttons as well, and although I didn't test the product, I'm keen on seeing whether Onyx was able to resolve the ghosting issues that's prevalent on its other devices.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an e-reader with a color panel</li><li>You want physical page turning buttons</li><li>You need a good design that's built to last</li><li>You want great battery life</li><li>You need customization-friendly software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an extensive built-in ebook store</li><li>You want a metallic chassis</li></ul>
<p>The Libra Colour delivers everything I need in an e-reader in 2025. The design isn't too heavy, and the white model looks quite elegant. Kobo did a great job with the weight distribution, and I didn't see any issues even after using the e-reader all day. The page turn buttons take a while to get used to as they're stiff out of the box, but once you've gotten acclimated to the e-reader, this isn't an issue. <br><br>The E Ink panel is delightful; text is clear and detailed with no ghosting, and there's extensive customizability when it comes to font selection. The icing on the cake is the color panel, and it's fun to view book covers and illustrations as intended. The warm light makes it easier to use the e-reader at night, and with Bluetooth, USB-C connectivity, and IPX8 ingress protection, Kobo nailed the basics. <br><br>The software is great to use, and there's no lag when navigating the interface or turning pages in a book. Battery life isn't quite as good as the Kindle Oasis, but you'll still only need to charge the device biweekly on average. Ultimately, the Libra Colour is the best e-reader to upgrade to if you're still on the Kindle Oasis.</p>
