                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I didn't see the point of photo frames, and I used my Nest Hub for a few years. But that changed when I got the Pexar; this is a 11-inch digital photo frame made by Lexar, and it is nothing short of incredible. It has a 11-inch anti-glare panel with 2K resolution, and the quality of the screen is better than any other photo frame I used.</p><p>It's also extremely easy to set up and use, and you can easily share photos from your phone, or transfer photos to the built-in 32GB internal storage. The best part is the discount; it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">now available for $139</a>, a $30 discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1102px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.14%;"><img id="a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF" name="Pexar by Lexar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a78DAtqGCKq46GPFTR9fpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1102" height="784" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Pexar's digital frame stands out for two reasons: it's easy to set up, and you can effortlessly share photos to the device. Then there's the panel: with a 2K resolution and anti-glare tech, it does a great job highlighting your family images. </p><p>This is the 11-inch size, and if you need a bigger photo frame, Lexar has the 15.6-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">Pexar Starlight that costs $297</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="869c84c2-4e63-43e1-b4a4-330f186d5478" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension48="Pexar Starlight that costs $297" data-dimension25="$139.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a high-quality photo frame that's easy to use. The anti-glare panel is the star of the show, and the high resolution combined with a matte texture make it the ideal showcase for your family photos.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a bigger size. Lexar now makes the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">available for $297</a>. I've been using both models, and honestly, the Starlight is the one you should get if you don't mind the bigger size.</p><p>I've been using the 11-inch Pexar digital photo frame for just over six months, and it has been delightful. The key standout feature of this frame is undoubtedly the 11-inch panel with a 2K (2000 x 1200) resolution. The higher resolution makes your photos shine, and the anti-glare coating on the panel means you don't get any reflections even with plenty of ambient light. I have the frame mounted on a showcase in the living room, and the anti-glare tech really makes a huge difference.</p><p>Another big selling point is just intuitive it is to get photos onto the frame; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can just connect to your phone and share images that way. Or if you want to just transfer photos to the frame, it has a built-in 32GB storage, and you can use an SD card or USB-A flash drive to plug into the frame.</p><p>The photo frame connects over Wi-Fi, and is available in two colors: black and tan. I use the black model as that doesn't shift focus to the design itself. There are other niceties, including auto rotation, a clock, and weather info for your location. On the whole, the Pexar is no doubt the best photo frame I used, and if you need a good holiday gift, this is the one to get — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">particularly with a discount to $139</a>.</p><p>I recently got started with the bigger model, the 15.6-inch Pexar Starlight. It has a bold design and comes with a wall light, and the panel quality is just as good, and it gets double the storage at 64GB. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Digital-Stunning-Anti-Glare-Touchscreen/dp/B0FP4QDBZ9">costlier at $297</a>, but if you need a bigger photo frame, it is the obvious recommendation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sometimes, you need to turn down the flashy hundreds-off watch deals and find a device that was already affordable to begin with, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4">$80 off the Versa 4</a>.

It comes with the K Pro Banana switches, but you can always change these out as needed, and what I like the most about the keyboard is the unique bounciness — you'll need to use it to understand what I mean.</p><p>While the Q1 HE has newer magnetic switches that let you change the actuation — making a difference in gaming — it doesn't have the same feel to it. I still prefer the Q1 Pro in this area, and I now use it with Gateron's brilliant Ink Black VB2 switches, and the tactility combined with the bounciness of the keyboard is just a joy.</p><p>I know shelling out close to $150 on a keyboard is a lot, but unlike your phone, the Q1 Pro is designed to last over a decade. If you're ready to switch, I think the Q1 Pro is the one to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B0BKGNVK98">get this Black Friday at $146</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Fenix 8 is Garmin's best available watch, but you can find <em>plenty</em> of excellent Garmin watches at much lower prices that offer 95% of the same software, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Translucent-Whitestone/dp/B0F8QZ7233"><strong>Forerunner 970 for $649 ($100 off)</strong></a>. Unless you're a dedicated diver, surfer, or water skier, the Forerunner 970 will give you the tools you need for $200 less, even if the deal is less impressive on paper.</p><p>And even that might be too expensive for you! The question is, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-black-friday-garmin-deals-2025">Garmin watch Black Friday deal</a> should you get?</p><h2 id="why-i-recommend-other-garmin-watches-before-the-fenix-8-2">Why I recommend other Garmin watches before the Fenix 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-hike-activity" alt="A hiking activity showing elevation, distance, time, and direction on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fenix 8 came out in August 2024. After its launch, Fenix 7 Pro and Epix Pro (Gen 2) owners realized Garmin had stopped supporting its "last-gen" watches with new features, even though they'd paid close to a grand for them only a short time ago.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-vs-fenix-8">Fenix 8 Pro</a> launched this summer, we can assume Garmin will launch a Fenix 9 in summer 2026. Once it does, past history suggests Garmin will stop giving the Fenix 8 new features, upselling its most dedicated fans to the next generation. That also applies to other Garmin watches, but it's easier to accept 1–2 years of updates when you're paying half as much.</p><p>The Fenix 8 is absurdly packed with features for almost every sport out there. So ask yourself, how often will you use Garmin's most niche sports modes, or can you live with a cheaper model that you have to take off <em>once</em> while snorkeling on vacation, or might "only" last two weeks per charge instead of three or four?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6emUGV8DPb68ivhpHCJayP" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Forerunner-970-hike-activity" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right), both on one wrist, showing near-identical stats for a hike activity's distance, time, elevation gain, and compass direction." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6emUGV8DPb68ivhpHCJayP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I reviewed Forerunner, Instinct, and Venu watches before I ever tried on a Fenix. I grew to appreciate their strong battery life, lightweight designs, and core training features, without realizing the niche tools that I was missing. And when I upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">965</a> with top-class tools and battery, they only cost $499–599.</p><p>That's why I don't want people to overpay for the Fenix 8, just because I liked testing it after receiving a free review unit. Its impressiveness doesn't mean I'd actually buy it myself! There are several great alternatives that I'd suggest first:</p><p><strong>If you want long battery life, an AMOLED display, and advanced Fenix-class features:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> is my first suggestion; if you want to spend even less, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-965-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-carbon-gray-tlc-titanium-2023/JXF9YF4C26/sku/6544443"><strong>Forerunner 965 is $449 ($150 off)</strong></a>, with 23-day battery life, the same dual-band GPS accuracy, and top-class features like offline maps, Endurance Score, real-time stamina, MTB Grit & Flow, and Strava Live Segments, though not the newest 970/ Fenix 8 tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> and Strength Coach.</p><p><strong>If you want a more stylish titanium watch:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-sapphire-edition-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-titanium-with-whitestone-band-2024/JXF9YF4LVF"><strong>Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) is $549 ($450 off)</strong></a>, with most of the same perks like fifth-gen health sensors, mic & speaker for calling, a flashlight for safety at night, and sapphire glass, paired with an impressive 16-day battery life and all of the same tricks as the Forerunner 965.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You want cutting-edge features and style, but not the extras for:</strong> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Advanced-Smartwatch-Colorful-Flashlight/dp/B0FRG18TLS"><strong>Garmin Venu 4 is $499 ($50 off)</strong></a>, with essentials like daily workout suggestions, training load, Bluetooth calling, health outliers from your baseline stats, and dual-band GPS. Its AMOLED display is twice as bright as the Fenix 8's, and its two-button design blends in more than the Fenix 8's sporty five-button look, while weighing less.</p><p><strong>You want the same cutting-edge features in a much lighter design</strong>. The Fenix 8's weight takes some getting used to, unless you buy the smaller model that lasts ten days. So why not shed a couple more days and buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C"><strong>Venu X1 for $599 ($200 off)</strong></a>? It lasts eight days per charge, but in exchange, you get an absurdly light and skinny design that blends in for hours-long workouts, paired with a 2-inch display that's <em>much</em> better than a Fenix 8's for following maps.</p><p>Feel free to ignore my advice if you have the money for the Fenix 8 and don't want to worry about the compromises of my other suggestions, like cheaper-looking polymer cases, fewer software perks, and shorter battery life. But I honestly think you shouldn't let FOMO upsell you to the Fenix 8 when other Garmin watches give you close to the same experience for hundreds less.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-other-black-friday-deals"><span>Other Black Friday deals</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I had over 75 phones delivered this year, and whether it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Huawei Mate XT</a>, the incredibly-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, the vibrant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> (I got the orange one), or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> with its outstanding cameras, there have been plenty of standouts this year.</p><p>Most flagships started using silicon batteries, leading to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and its 7,500mAh battery, and Vivo outdid itself with the cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>. While these phones are limited to select global regions, there's a decent selection of phones to consider if you're in North America.</p><p>Google got its act together this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, delivering a flagship that excels in all areas. The Pixel 9a, meanwhile, is the best budget phone around. And if you need an all-rounder that gets everything right, the OnePlus 13 is still my go-to recommendation. With Black Friday in full swing, now is the best time to buy a phone if you're looking to do so.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7743feec-970a-42cc-aeca-0766f48f949b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Pixel 9a is all the phone you need if you just want a budget device with great cameras.

With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHTT1GS">now selling at just $349</a>, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone.</p><p>If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">now down to $699</a>. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to.</p><p>And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTSKP7M/">bringing it down to $899</a>. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is in full swing, it turns out it wasn't a fluke; the Pixel 10 is back down to its lowest price this year, with a pretty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/"><strong>impressive 25% discount</strong></a>.</p><p>To me, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a> felt appropriately priced at $800, but at 25% off, you're paying just $600 for a pretty fantastic phone.

A savings of $200 brings the Pixel 10 back down to its lowest price we've seen this year, with a deal that feels almost too good to be true.

Not only does it come with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">new Tensor chip</a> and larger battery, but it also gets features that finally help justify the $800 price tag (making the discount feel that much sweeter).</p><p>The addition of a third camera finally gives you incredible zoom detail with the 5x telephoto sensor. Plus, the new cameras capture images that feel much livelier than those from previous models, which I talk a bit more about in my Pixel 10 camera review.</p><p>Battery life also feels great, with the phone easily lasting all day. Google manages to be the first company to stick full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2</a> compatibility on a flagship Android phone. This means you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> with the Pixel 10 without needing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">case</a>, just like recent iPhones. It's incredibly convenient, especially when it comes to portable power banks, stands, storage devices, and more.</p><p>But of course, you can't talk about Pixel without mentioning the software and AI. Google takes its AI chops to the next level with a host of new and improved features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live</a> and more. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> surfaces relevant on-device information for you based on conversations you're having or things you're doing, so you don't have to search for it. It's a huge time-saver and really showcases how AI can be actually useful.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a> is also a neat feature that can help you take the perfect photo by guiding you through the process. Just tell it what kind of photo you want to take and follow the steps. It works based on whatever scene is in the viewfinder, so it'll know just how to capture the moment.</p><p>And once you've ordered a Pixel 10, be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bought-a-new-pixel-these-are-the-must-have-accessories-to-grab-before-black-friday-ends"><strong>Black Friday Pixel collection</strong></a> for the perfect accessories to pair with your new phone!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You might be wondering why would anyone buy a device that's ten years old, especially a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming device</a>, since there are much newer options.</p><p>I don't know, call me a fan of the classics. That's what these dinosaurs are to me, but instead of being put up on a shelf or tossed in a bucket, I'm actually going to replace my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer 4K</a> with the Shield TV Pro in my home office.</p><p>Looking at the functionality, the Shield TV Pro checks pretty much all of the boxes one could want from a streaming device, and then some. For one, it's equipped with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is more than you'll find on competing devices. There are also two built-in USB ports, which allows me to plug in my hard drive full of ROMs.</p><p>The power and flexibility surpasses almost every other streaming device I have, besides the Apple TV 4K that's tethered to the TV in my living room. But what's even more impressive is that despite its age, NVIDIA just keeps rolling out new updates.</p><p>Just earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidia-shield-tv/nvidia-shield-tv-update-november-2025">Shield Experience 9.2.2 arrived</a>, bringing with it another batch of "stability improvements," along with "new accessibility additions." Are these major updates? Of course not, but I'll be damned if you can find any other streaming device that's still getting updates ten years after its release.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The opposite happened — CMF Headphone Pro blew me away with long battery life, solid sound quality, and impressive ANC (for the price).

appreciate the LDAC support of up to 990 kbps, and getting a hi-res audio codec for only $79 is outstanding. The Hybrid Adaptive ANC is as good as you'll get at this price point, too.

But even discounted, you still have to pay upward of $449 (Forerunner 965) or $649 (Forerunner 970) for the <em>best</em> software features, especially offline maps for trail running or hiking.</p><p>That's why, even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/COROS-PACE-Pro-Touchscreen-Navigation/dp/B0DK31TB7G"><strong>COROS PACE Pro at $299 ($50 off)</strong></a> isn't the biggest Black Friday deal, it's a great alternative because it started off "cheap" for the value it offers: 20 days of battery life, a 1.3-inch AMOLED display, dual-band GPS that worked quite accurately in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro review</a>, and offline hiking and street maps that were updated to include street names and places of interest earlier this year.</p><p>The bigger Black Friday deal that'll tempt more people is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-265-gps-smartwatch-46-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-black-2023/JXF9YF4J4X"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 265 at $299 ($150 off)</strong></a>, but if you compare them directly, the PACE Pro offers an extra week of battery life and about double the dual-band GPS tracking (31 vs. 14 hours), and its brighter display (1,500 vs. 1,000 nits) displays maps clearly while Garmin only gives the 265 breadcrumb navigation. They both offer essentials like training load, recovery recommendations, and personalized running regimens.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1b837e3a-aae6-4855-86db-8e5e2d0075a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$299.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/COROS-PACE-Pro-Touchscreen-Navigation/dp/B0DK31TB7G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CCwXeCFxZHJWiDxw9vLByT" name="coros-pace-pro-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCwXeCFxZHJWiDxw9vLByT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="1b837e3a-aae6-4855-86db-8e5e2d0075a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$299.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★</a></p><p>I ranked the COROS PACE Pro as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best mid-range running watch</a> available today, beating out alternatives from Garmin, Suunto, Polar, Amazfit, and others for both accuracy and value. </p><p>COROS gave the PACE Pro a speedy processor (for a fitness watch), so when using the topographic maps, zooming in/ out with the crown or swiping on the touchscreen is speedy and seamless. And its EvoLab training suite will help you stay focused for your marathon training.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/COROS-PACE-Pro-Touchscreen-Navigation/dp/B0DK31TB7G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1b837e3a-aae6-4855-86db-8e5e2d0075a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gHtfmmA6Z4J76gsspmXN8m" name="COROS-Heart-Rate-Monitor-sensor.jpeg" alt="The COROS Heart Rate Monitor sitting on a table outside.

But without offline maps, the Instinct series relies on breadcrumb navigation, which just isn't that helpful when you come to a confusing trailhead; the lighter PACE Pro lets you check which trail you're on and makes it easier to improvise if you decide to take a different route.</p><p>COROS dropped the PACE Pro price after launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros/i-tested-the-coros-pace-4-and-its-new-best-cheap-running-watch-of-2025">PACE 4</a>, which is a cheaper alternative...but only if you don't need maps. And the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> is an intriguing hiking alternative with maps, if you prefer an MIP display, but it's not discounted for Black Friday.</p><p>While most people will buy the PACE Pro from Amazon, if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/pacepro">buy from COROS</a> directly, you'll get 25% off a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a>, a comfortable armband with accurate data for people who don't trust smartwatches for HR data but don't want to wear a constricting chest strap. Just put both devices in your cart, and you'll see the $20 discount.</p><p>Again, this sneaky second deal isn't especially large, but that's only because the $79 COROS HRM is already affordable. And I genuinely recommend it, having worn it during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">recent Garmin marathon</a>, synced to my Garmin watch to give me faster results when my heart rate climbs or drops.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-2">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google just released a new Nest Cam Indoor (third-generation), and it includes a few highly-requested features: 2K video recording and AI-based camera detection.  I've been eying an smart home camera upgrade to go with my Nest Doorbell, and the third-gen Nest Cam Indoor checks all my boxes — and it's on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>. This camera only came out last month, and it's already $25 off for Black Friday, bringing the Nest Cam Indoor down to only $75.</p><p>It's such a good deal that I'm buying more than one Nest Cam Indoor at this price. If you're deep in the Google ecosystem with Pixel or Nest devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">Nest Cam Indoor</a> is a great way to expand your smart home while improving security. Here's why Google's best indoor security camera is a can't-miss deal at 25% off.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Cam-Indoor-Wired/dp/B0FN7GF1ZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SBfHRevpHY5ftoK9bNDAvP" name="Nest-Cam-Indoor-3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBfHRevpHY5ftoK9bNDAvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Google's latest Nest Cam Indoor <em>finally</em> upgrades the camera's resolution to 2K, and fully supports the AI-based camera detection features offered with Gemini for Home. Plus, the design is very homey with Snow, Hazel, and Berry color options available. </p><p>Price comparison: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-nest-cam-indoor-wired-3rd-gen-latest-model-2k-video-and-gemini-snow/J39TC8JG2V/sku/6642734" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99">Best Buy - $74.99</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_cam_indoor_wired_3rd_gen?sku=GA09973-US" target="_blank">Google - $74.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Cam-Indoor-Wired/dp/B0FN7GF1ZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2da0513c-1c84-4875-b864-f016ed305e6e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $74.99" data-dimension25="$74.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you need a Google-connected, in-home security camera; you want Gemini for Home camera and motion detection; you want hi-res video feeds and 24/7 recording.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don't want to pay for a subscription for advanced features; you need a camera with end-to-end encryption.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-buying-a-bunch-of-google-s-nest-cam-indoor-security-cameras-2">Why I'm buying a bunch of Google's Nest Cam Indoor security cameras</h2><p>There's one thing I absolutely love about Google's Nest Cam Indoor, and it's the security camera's design. For an indoor camera, it's important that the design feels homey and blends into your kitchen, living room, or bedroom. Google gets this right with the Nest Cam Indoor — it's unassuming and blends in with Snow (white), Hazel (gray), and Berry (red). I went with the Berry model, as it'll look more like an accent piece than a scary security system in my home.</p><p>Then, you have the upgraded hardware. Nest Cameras formerly had a 1080p video-resolution limit, which paled in comparison to the swath of 2K and 4K models on the market. Now, the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen) has a 2K resolution (2560x1440) and a 152-degree field of view.</p><p>There's also 6x digital zoom support for when you need to crop in close. You also get 30 FPS video recording and HDR2 support, ensuring your security footage is always crisp. And, a night vision feature means you can see clearly inside your home, even when it's dark.</p><p>Some might view the internet-connected nature and subscription model of Google's Nest cameras as a drawback, but I look at it as a feature. You can always pop in and look at your Nest Cam Indoor feed from anywhere using the Google Home app, completely free. Up to six hours of event recording is included, too. With a Google Home Standard or Premium subscription, you can get up to 24/7 video recording, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-home-app-update-improves-geminis-voice-assistant-and-simplifies-descriptions">plus Gemini descriptions and object detection</a>.</p><p>Overall, Google added everything you might want to the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen). If you're looking to build out your Google ecosystem and home security setup this Black Friday, there's no better buy.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">Black Friday 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I can't think of a better way to describe it. We'll see one price on its 2025 watches and foldables, refresh the page, and see an even better price. Right now, with no trade-in necessary, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/"><strong>Galaxy Watch 8 for $199 ($150 off) on Samsung.com for Black Friday</strong></a>, with the same $150-off deal for the 44mm model ($229) or LTE upgrades ($249 or $279).</p><p>Tech companies usually charge a consistent price across their own sites and retailer sites, but the Galaxy Watch 8 is <strong>$249</strong> ($100 off) on Amazon and Best Buy. I assumed Samsung would have a better trade-in deal for your old watch, but you don't even <em>need</em> to send Samsung anything to get "$150 instant credit."</p><p>The only problem is that I <strong>can't guarantee you'll </strong><em><strong>see</strong></em><strong> this deal price</strong>. It was originally $249 for me, and I still see $249 if I look in an incognito window. It's the same with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deal-official-2025">Galaxy Z Flip 7 deal</a>, which varies between $200 or $300 off, seemingly on a whim. My advice is to follow the link to Samsung.com, and if you don't see $150 off, try refreshing, or adding and removing a trade-in option, and see if this "exclusive for you" deal appears eventually.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> of the year, and while the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> is a tough rival, it's only $50 off for Black Friday, making the $199 Galaxy Watch 8 a much better deal.</p><p>What makes it so great, aside from the price? The polarizing squircle case has the upside of making it skinny and lightweight, perfect for sleep tracking or workouts, but it still has a rugged shock-proofing and sapphire glass. Samsung also gives its watches the best update guarantee of any Android watch brand, with four promised years of feature and security updates (Google only offers three), and the One UI 8 Watch software is seamless and efficient.</p><p>Other retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch8-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-silver-2025/JJGRF3X43F"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="60a37060-7776-4628-9b03-d58e128c2aea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i7Niwr559v6v7hufGKQN3b" name="Samsung-Black-Friday-hidden-deal" alt="A screenshot of Samsung's website showing a Galaxy Watch 8 product page with a $199 price and "$150 instant credit" available." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7Niwr559v6v7hufGKQN3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1755" height="987" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Proof that I'm not making this up </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you have a recent Galaxy Watch, you can cut the price as low as $99 with a trade-in; send Samsung your Watch 7 ($100 extra off) or Watch 6 ($75 extra) to cut the price absurdly low for a smartwatch that's only four months old! But as it is, the current $150 "instant credit" basically acts like a huge trade-in discount on its own, so you don't <em>need</em> to make the trip to the post office if you don't want to.</p><p>Your alternative is to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which is only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream-2024/J3ZYG2KQ89"><strong>$129 at Best Buy</strong></a>. That, too, is an all-time low for an excellent Wear OS watch, and if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, they're virtually identical for performance, storage, battery life, and other specs.</p><p>But I'd recommend buying the Galaxy Watch 8, <em>if</em> you can snag it at that $199 price. Aside from giving you an extra year of support through 2029 and better trade-in value down the line, the display is slightly larger (1.34- vs. 1.3-inch) and brighter (3k vs. 2k nits), and our reviewer insisted that the squircle design will grow on you, even if you're used to circular smartwatches.

Not only does the gorgeous OLED display on the front make this watch feel more premium than the price suggests, but the modular nature of the watch means you can switch out the bands <em>and</em> the bezel, giving you a substantial number of physical style options to choose from even after you buy the watch.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="134eaeac-b892-4eb7-bcb6-b55cd8c72e24" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" data-dimension48="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Watch-Pro-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0D812N1MM/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hrCWRJnwhmD3ciPCR3AgGo" name="cmf watch pro 2 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrCWRJnwhmD3ciPCR3AgGo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>CMF Watch Pro 2: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Watch-Pro-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0D812N1MM/" data-dimension112="134eaeac-b892-4eb7-bcb6-b55cd8c72e24" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" data-dimension48="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" data-dimension25=""><del>$79</del> <strong>$49 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>It's hard to imagine an OLED smartwatch could get any cheaper than this, but Amazon has knocked it down to a record-breaking $49. With over 120 tracked workouts, heart rate and sleep tracking, 11-day battery life, and a modular design, it's hard to top this impressive looking smartwatch.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CMF-Watch-Pro-2-Smartwatch-Fitness-Tracker-Heart-Rate-SPO-Monitoring-120-Sports-Model-Bluetooth-Calls-AI-Noise-Reduction-IP68-Waterproof-GPS-Android/13193811544">Walmart - $49</a> | <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-watch-pro-2?variant=45068152766616">Nothing (official) - $49</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Watch-Pro-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0D812N1MM/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="134eaeac-b892-4eb7-bcb6-b55cd8c72e24" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" data-dimension48="CMF Watch Pro 2: $79" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a unique-looking smartwatch that works with Android and iOS, offers nearly two-week battery life and still sports all the features you want, all without breaking the bank.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're looking for a smartwatch with a specific ecosystem tie-in or a watch with advanced workout options. Garmin, Amazefit, or Wear OS offer more features but cost a lot more money.</p><p>The CMF Watch Pro 2 runs on Nothing's own smartwatch OS, enabling 11-day battery life in addition to tons of custom watch faces, 120-tracked workouts, and plenty of features you're going to love. Plus, it works with both Android and iOS, making this a good choice no matter your smartphone preference.</p><p>But don't just take my word for it! With nearly 1300 reviews on Amazon, this one has earned 4.3/5 stars since its release last summer. Obviously, a $50 smartwatch isn't going to last you forever or do everything that a $500 Garmin can, but you shouldn't expect it to, anyway. If you just want a stylish smartwatch with fitness and sleep tracking, great style, and notification management, this is a superb choice for a crazy low price.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I tried the Sony WH-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5, and even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/apples-brand-new-airpods-pro-3-are-down-to-their-lowest-price-at-just-usd220">AirPods Pro 3</a> for good measure. But none could hold a candle to Bose's second-generation QuietComfort Ultra headphones and earbuds.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones and earbuds only recently came out, but they're already seeing major discounts for Black Friday. You can snag the headphones as low as $399 and the earbuds for only $216 — I think the latter is the best earbud deal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> season. Here's why anyone in the market for new earbuds or headphones should take advantage of these Bose deals.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="45b1b06e-8dc6-4307-afe3-177d3f1b3fdc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Best Buy - $216" data-dimension48="Best Buy - $216" data-dimension25="$216" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-New-QuietComfort-Ultra-Earbuds/dp/B0F7M3HPBD/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="YJwSx2qUb66cj6TbCtJWEE" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YJwSx2qUb66cj6TbCtJWEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 take the best-sounding ANC earbuds and make them even better, with upgrades like wireless charging and improved call quality.

That's high praise, and it goes to show just how good the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones and earbuds are.</p><p>I've tested all of the best earbuds, but none are as well-rounded as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a>. These earbuds provide standout active noise-canceling modes and the strongest bass I've ever heard a pair of earbuds reproduce. That's all while adding excellent call quality and a surprisingly-comfortable feel. They're on the larger side of wireless earbuds, but intuitive design and extra silicone stabilizers ensure they stay secure in your ears.</p><p>Up until now, the one gripe I had was with the earbuds' price. At $299, they were ahead of the AirPods Pro 3 and Sony WF-1000XM5. Now, at $216 for Black Friday, they're actually <em>lower</em> than those earbuds at MSRP.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

2 headphones</a>. I still give a very <em>slight</em> edge to the AirPods Max in terms of raw noise-canceling power, but Bose crushes Apple — and every other brand — in the other areas. That's why, for the first time, I brought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones with me for my Thanksgiving cross-country travel. I haven't been disappointed. They're comfortable, detailed, and compact, with better sound quality and ANC than any pair of headphones not named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a>.</p><p>At $399 for a limited time, the price is very easier to stomach.

Google didn’t make a big announcement about these changes; they just showed up on the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805" target="_blank">support page</a>, first noticed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/gemini-3-pro-free-limits/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>More people are using Gemini 3 Pro than Google probably expected. The model offers better reasoning, more features, and clearer visuals thanks to Nano Banana Pro’s improved rendering engine.</p><p>This high demand puts a lot of strain on Google’s servers, especially since access is free. To avoid problems, Google is quietly reducing free access so the platform keeps working well for everyone.</p><p>The move also nudges heavier users — people who rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> for research, writing, or content creation — toward paid upgrades like Google's $20/month AI Pro Plan if they want stable performance and consistent access to the top-tier model.</p><h2 id="forced-downgrade-2">Forced downgrade</h2><p>Under these new limits, free users aren’t locked out entirely, but hitting the cap now pushes them back to Google’s Fast model.</p><p>NotebookLM is also running into some capacity issues, as per Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/1993387297081827346" target="_blank">post on X</a>, so a few of its smarter tools are getting dialed back for now. Free users can’t access Infographics or Slide Decks at the moment, and even Pro subscribers are seeing new limits to help keep the service stable for everyone.</p><p>For casual users, these new limits might not be a problem. If you only ask a question or two each day, you may never reach the cap. But people who use Gemini 3 Pro for daily work will notice the restrictions right away.</p><p>The situation is even more frustrating because there’s no clear indicator of how many prompts remain — the system simply switches models when it decides you’ve had enough for the day.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One such feature is AI-powered notification summaries, something iPhone users have been enjoying for some time. These are just as they sound, summaries of longer messages designed to help you easily scan over a sort of Coles Notes (remember those?) version to get the gist of it.</p><p>AI summaries are great for seeing the key points of a lengthy message before opening it up, or a summary of a longer conversation you missed in a group thread.

It's only available in English for now, but Google will likely be rolling out support for other languages eventually.</p><p>AI Summaries only works with longer missives that require summation. If it's a short message, like your teen's typical "k," there's, of course, nothing to summarize. It won't work if the message consists of just emoji either: you'll have to spend some time deciphering that on your own. Finally, it doesn't work if you're actively using your phone. It only kicks in if the phone is in sleep mode and you're not already in the app or actively using your device.</p><p>If, for whatever reason, you find that AI Summaries aren't working, make sure your phone isn't in battery saver mode, which will pause this feature to conserve battery life. It's also a good idea to restart your phone after turning AI Summaries on and verify your connection to a network.</p><p>As noted, AI Summaries is a feature that iPhone users have been enjoying for some time. Being able to glance at your phone and see that the message is saying the person is on their way versus running late or needs to cancel without having to unlock the phone and open the app is more useful than you might realize. The byproduct of this is also fewer distractions. You don't need to constantly pick up your phone when it "dings" only to see that it's a mundane message that can wait, or bored chatter in an ongoing thread that you don't need to address immediately.</p><p>Features like this ensure you are informed of important messages and only need to pick up the phone and read in full when the summary suggests it's something that requires a timely response.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="05b802b5-d146-4ab8-8607-2fe9e3351e7c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>First in line for all the best features</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 is guaranteed to get the latest Android updates before any other phone.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Last year, Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring to huge expectations for its wearable future. The problem was that it was way too expensive, offering relatively little functionality for the $399 price. Now that it's a year old and we're already celebrating Black Friday again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F"><strong>it's down to a </strong><em><strong>very</strong></em><strong> cool $279</strong></a>.</p><p>That's $120 off Samsung's only smart ring in any of the three available colors, and you'll never need a subscription to access its best features. While every major retailer has the Galaxy Ring on sale for the same price today, Best Buy is the best place to go because most of them offer sizing right in store, making it easy to grab a Ring <em>today</em> instead of having to wait for a sizing kit to ship to your door.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1631px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-official-render-titanium-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjGYwYg2vgeMwknCtD4Qab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1631" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$279 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>At full price, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is simply an overpriced smart ring. But at $279? Now THAT'S a Black Friday deal! And unlike Oura, this one doesn't require a subscription to get the best features. Hop into Best Buy today, do a fitting to get the right size, and walk out with a healthier mindset going into 2025!</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Subscription-Monitoring-Titanium-Manufacturer/dp/B0D3JF9VF8/">Amazon - $279</a> | <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/rings/galaxy-ring/buy/galaxy-ring-size-5-titanium-silver-sm-q505nzsaxar/">Samsung - $279</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-12-titanium-black-2024/J3ZYG2ZJ8F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="177e8b57-98b9-468f-8d5f-5a1eb7e4b6fb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Ring: $399" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're an Android or Samsung user who wants 24/7 health monitoring without having to wear a watch all day, or you want sleep cycle monitoring but hate wearing a watch to bed.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need robust fitness or workout tracking. The Galaxy Ring is great for basic heart rate and step monitoring, but doesn't accurately offer advanced features like SpO2.</p><p>It's no secret that I strongly disliked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> at launch. The Ring was overpriced and did very little considering that, but $279 changes the conversation quite a bit. If you're anything like me and don't like wearing watches throughout the day (or night), a smart ring like this could be the thing you're looking for.</p><p>As a whole, the Galaxy Ring is generally good at three things: 24/7 heart rate monitoring, step tracking, and sleep cycle tracking. Its 7-day battery life also means you can plop it on the charger at the end of the weekend and not have to think about it for the rest of the week.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is <em>not</em> good at basically anything else. Don't expect it to give you advanced health metrics like SpO2, VO2 max, or function as a workout tracker. For that, you really just need to stick with a smartwatch or fitness band. If that sounds good to you, you won't find a better deal this year (or mayb ever) on this ring.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-42">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

One offer in particular has captured my attention and could save you some serious cash if you play your cards right: from today through December 1st, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><strong>sign up for a year of the Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle and you'll only pay $4.99 per month for 12 months.</strong></a> Since the streaming bundle usually costs $12.99 per month, you're looking at a total discount of 61% on a year of content. It's as simple as that.</p><p>The only catch is that only new and returning subscribers are eligible, so if you're already using the service (or the popular Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN bundle), then you might be out of luck. On the bright side, if you do sign up for the Black Friday deal, you can cancel at any time without any penalty. In other words, you'll get 30 days of complete access to two of the world's most popular streaming services, and it'll only cost you five bucks! Sounds like holiday magic to me.</p><h2 id="get-disney-plus-and-hulu-for-just-5-per-month-2">Get Disney Plus AND Hulu for just $5 per month</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ab94d235-c465-41fa-abb0-820d4ff48154" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension48="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RP3iTSerhvF9RtgJNpSAgd" name="disney-plus-app-icon.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RP3iTSerhvF9RtgJNpSAgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="512" height="512" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): </strong><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" data-dimension112="ab94d235-c465-41fa-abb0-820d4ff48154" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension48="Disney Plus and Hulu Bundle (with ads): $12.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$12.99</del> <strong>$4.99 per month for 12 months</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, new and returning customers can score 61% off the price of one year of the Disney Bundle.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Sometimes, learning can seem a little unfavorable, but Google is rolling out an AI update for the arts and sciences that might make it exciting, if not wacky.</p><p>Announced this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/ai-cultural-learning/">Google highlighted </a>an AI experimental update for its Arts & Culture app that can merge you or someone you know into an educational clip. Something that stands out in this AI update is the app's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/kQGgmM6Aoohkrw">World Toon Video</a>" experiment. According to its notes, Google says users can take a selfie, which will be placed into a generative AI "educational video clip" narrative.</p><p>After snapping a selfie, users can swipe through their "style," such as puppet, cartoon, old cartoon, and more. Then, you'll select a "scene." This is what determines the educational reason behind your character cruising across the moon or snaking through a dense jungle. Google's AI will generate your character and the setting before animating it into a video clip.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q91qkXwMKKc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The second Arts & Culture experiment is called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/qwGvFCEHA4HpQQ">Learn Everything</a>." This feature was designed on the basis that regular things in our lives can actually become a cool teaching moment. Google's notes state, to get started, users need only take a photo of something mundane: a coffee mug, a light bulb, or a plant. The AI will use your photo as a "metaphor" for that teaching moment, which users can decide after.</p><p>Per Google's example, users can take a photo of a light bulb and tell the AI that it wants to learn about Stellar Evolution at an Intermediate level (there are also Beginner and Advanced levels).</p><p>The AI will generate that explainer, using your photo as fuel, shortly after.</p><p>The final experiment, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/art-chat">already available in the Arts & Culture app</a>, is "Arts Chat." It's a similar experience users who've engaged with AI chatbots will recognize. Google states users can converse with the AI in "real-time" about famous artists and their work, as well as watch "explainer videos" about art genres. Of course, the backbone of this feature is Gemini, so that leans a little more into that recognizable experience.</p><h2 id="never-forgotten-2">Never forgotten</h2><p>It seems as if Google's AI knows no bounds, as it's even toiling away at features (even if experimental) for its Arts & Culture app. There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-arts-and-culture-redesign">a larger update</a> a while ago, which brought new goodies, like an Inspire feed and AI poems. Joining the Inspire feed was the app's Explore tab about artifacts and historical/cultural stories. Additionally, the AI poems were brought to users by Google's PaLM 2 model.</p><p>What was generated could be sent to friends or family, as well.</p><p>Also, the app's new World Toon Video seems like an extension of what the app already had: Art Selfie. Users can take a selfie of themselves and see it transformed into a historical art piece that others can guess where it's from. It's a little bit of a game mixed with educational learning, which, at the end of the day, might help you kill some time, at least.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, it's not for everyone, but if you've been planning to change up your wireless service anyway, it's an exceptional Black Friday opportunity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FfWPQLx9aLqno3wu5nuCLf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-26" alt="Pixel 10 display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfWPQLx9aLqno3wu5nuCLf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best flagship phones released this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a> is a stunner inside and out.

My colleague and Senior Content Producer at Android Central, Nicholas Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">agrees wholeheartedly with me</a>. Both Sutrich and I agree that it gets impressively small, shrinking down to 13 inches, and doesn't weigh much. Thus, it is perfect for travel as it fits in a backpack easily, too.</p><p>While the magnetic mount does swivel up to 180 degrees, it would have been nice if it could rotate a full 360 degrees. And while the base isn't as sturdy as some of the more expensive and bulkier tripods out there, that is to be expected with something this compact and lightweight.</p><p>You can use the built-in Bluetooth remote to capture photos and videos remotely. The little remote is usually docked into the tripod's body magnetically. It charges via USB-C, which is another upside of the KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Basically, the WH-1000XM5 continues to be a solid choice if you need a new headset, and although it may not be Sony's latest, it still holds its own.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the cost; with the XM6 now available, the WH-1000XM5 is inevitably on sale, and while Sony discounted it to $298 in the past, it's going even more aggressive this Black Friday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B09XS7JWHH">selling the headset for just $248</a>. To be clear, this is a record low price for the headset, and the huge 38% discount makes it one of the best Black Friday audio deals.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="43fac6cc-e00b-4015-b3ef-099dde7ed25e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The WH-1000XM5 is still a great headset; you get outstanding noise isolation, stunning sound quality with a decent amount of customizability, and great battery life.

Sony excels at ANC, with the headset doing a magnificent job tuning out ambient sounds. Combine that with the fit and all the extras you get, and the XM5 still holds up against the XM6.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a design with foldable hinges. While the XM5 folds flat, it doesn't have an inward-folding mechanism.</p><p>The WH-1000XM5 has been around for two and a half years now, and considering Sony didn't change the design at all with the WH-1000XM6, you're not missing out on anything in this area. Having used both headsets extensively, the only difference is that the inward-folding hinges on the XM6 make it easier to carry around — that's it. Outside of that, you get a similar level of comfort, and the XM5 is just as lightweight.</p><p>Sony is in the lead when it comes to ANC, with the XM5 doing an excellent job tuning out any ambient noises in your surroundings. It does this to a greater extent than Bose, and it is evident if you travel a lot — the whine of a jet engine isn't as audible. Outside of that, you get solid Bluetooth connectivity, a good level of customizability, and a transparency mode.</p><p>Sound quality is another area where Sony excels; the brand has a distinct sound signature, focusing on an engaging low-end with exaggerated sub-bass that makes listening to music highly enjoyable. Battery life is great too, and if anything, you can easily get 30 hours out of a full charge, and there's fast charging available as well.</p><p>All of this is to say that the WH-1000XM5 is still a great headset in spite of the XM6's introduction, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B09XS7JWHH">Sony discounting it to $248</a>, I'd suggest getting the XM5 if you're ready to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

No, I don't use it like a traditional tablet, but instead, it sits on the Charging Speaker Dock and operates as my smart home hub. This is where it excels the most, at least for my needs, as I have other tablets that handle things like gaming or working.</p><p>Unlike some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, the Pixel Tablet doesn't really do anything spectacular. It's kind of the same feeling that I get when using a Pixel phone that isn't the Fold, as it just serves a purpose without any frills. Frankly, it's pretty refreshing when you think about the different ads and features that are sandwiched into other tablets, which really only serve to slow everything down.</p><p>The elephant in the room here is that we're just a few months away from when the last Android OS update is expected to come to the Pixel Tablet. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">June 2026</a>, the only updates the Pixel Tablet will receive will be the monthly security patches, which are slated to continue until June 2028.</p><p>There's been speculation about Google offering a way to re-purpose the Pixel Tablet, but we haven't really seen anything concrete.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Look, we all want something for nothing on Black Friday. The day has a pedigree for a reason, but it looks like one company is living up to our obnoxiously lofty expectations: <em>Samsung</em>. If you grab a Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uzgexaa/"><strong>directly from Samsung</strong></a> this Black Friday, you'll get the $1420 512GB model for a ludicrous $859 <em>out the door</em>. No trade-in nonsense, no financing silliness, and no carrier contract.</p><p>Samsung makes that offer even better by including the three Samsung.com exclusive colors, something that normally isn't included in deals like this. To put this deal in perspective, <strong>Amazon is offering the 256GB model for $899</strong>, meaning you'll not only pay $40 for the "privilege" of paying off Jeff Bezos' next rocket, but you'll also be getting <strong>half</strong> the amount of storage. The same scenario plays out at Best Buy, Walmart, and elsewhere.</p><p>In other words, if you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> this year, get it straight from Samsung and stop looking elsewhere. This is the best deal <em>of all time</em>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1ea7e331-c71d-4ad3-8988-2970490a6790" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uakexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi" name="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uakexaa/" data-dimension112="1ea7e331-c71d-4ad3-8988-2970490a6790" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,419.99</del> <strong>$859.99 at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> on the market, but it's far from cheap.

Not only does the company offer Black Friday's best discount, but it doubles the storage, offers exclusive colors, and even allows you to trade in your old phone or finance the device to make it easier to purchase.</p><p>I'd recommend buying unlocked through Samsung, as the carrier variants of the phone don't seem to offer any additional discounts over today's ludicrous sale. An unlocked phone typically resells for a higher value down the road, and also offers you the chance to easily switch carriers at any time without having to deal with their BS.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-52">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As soon as Google releases updates, the Pixel 9a gets them too. It was one of the first phones to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, and thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset, it'll get the same seven years of OS updates as the other phones in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><p>I personally use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> as a beta device to test new Android versions, and at this price, you might want to consider doing the same if you want the latest Android experience without risking your daily driver.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VPBvnm4yMbwXXZYQEACLk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VPBvnm4yMbwXXZYQEACLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apart from that, you get great battery life as well, something we can't say about all Pixel phones. The Pixel 9a packs a 5,100 mAh battery that easily lasts a full day without reaching for a charger. Plus, you get the signature Pixel camera with consistent results in all conditions, something most budget phones simply can't match.</p><p>Sure, there are downsides to an A-series phone. For example, the bezels around the Pixel 9a's display are fairly thick, and there's no telephoto camera on the back, which means no optical zoom apart from the 2x crop on the main sensor. But these are expected limitations for a budget device.</p><p>All that said, if you're looking for a new smartphone this Black Friday without spending too much, or want to gift someone a phone without worrying about fancy flagship features, the Pixel 9a is more than good enough, especially considering it'll be supported long term.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-37">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Grabbing a Meta Quest 3 at Best Buy today will get you a $75 Best Buy gift card, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3-512gb--virtual-reality-headset-without-wires-thirty-percent-sharper-resolution-2x-graphical-processing-white/6554912.p"><strong>making it effectively $425</strong></a>.</p><p>Everyone's got someone who wants something at Best Buy this holiday season (maybe that's you!), making that gift card nearly as good as cash.

It's cheaper because it includes less storage and uses the same lenses from the Quest 2, which aren't as clear as the mainline Quest 3. They play the same games and have all the same capabilities, though, making this an incredible pick if you're not nitpicky about the visuals.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-57">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus obviously makes standout Android phones, and the manufacturer embarked on an ambitious undertaking 18 months ago where it created one-off accessories by partnering with other brands. The most well-known collaboration to come out of this was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/oneplus-keyboard-81-pro-review">OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro</a> mechanical keyboard that was made by Keychron.</p><p>We also got a power bank, made by Sharge. Now, if you haven't come across Sharge, the Chinese accessory maker is known for its industrial design, and its products tend to be wild — like the Sharge 170 power bank. Anyway, Sharge collaborated with OnePlus last year over a 10,000mAh 3-in-1 power bank, and it has a modular design that's just plain cool. The power bank itself is standard and has a vertical design, with a unique red cable that's even more distinctive than what OnePlus usually bundles on its phones.</p><p>But where it stands out is a magnetic attachment that lets you charge the power bank, or use it as a dedicated wall charger. The best part is you get USB PD 40W alongside SuperVOOC 55W charging, making this the best power bank to use with any OnePlus phone. The icing on the cake is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/sharge-Charging-10000mAh-Portable-SUPERVOOC/dp/B0D7J513XG">power bank is now down to $42</a>, and now is the best time to buy it.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c3e5b59f-295f-416f-8aa7-8a5d947d222a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="There's no doubt that this is one of the best power banks if you have a OnePlus phone.

Where the Sharge variant stands out is the design; most power banks don't draw too much attention, but that isn't the case with this one — thanks to a metal housing up top and a modular attachment, this power bank is built to stand out.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="J2bh5wdk9fEcqKgotYYU66" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J2bh5wdk9fEcqKgotYYU66.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SgcVtVfe8yheEYFzNJmqD6" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SgcVtVfe8yheEYFzNJmqD6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="H2yoSmDYsqNvqxnxKJjiD6" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2yoSmDYsqNvqxnxKJjiD6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4eFgMCNNsZRt9cvzbnFk46" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4eFgMCNNsZRt9cvzbnFk46.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It is on the bigger side, and I have 20,000mAh power banks that are roughly the same size. That said, one half of the power bank is basically a wall charger, and it attaches to the battery via magnetic pogo pins. You can charge two devices with the power bank simultaneously, and use the wall charger with a third device.</p><p>Another standout is the 55W SuperVOOC charging; if you use a OnePlus phone, you know that you only get 10W charging with most power banks, and that's not an issue here. While it isn't a given that this power bank will get anywhere close to the kind of mainstream attention as UGREEN and Baseus products, it is pretty noteworthy in its own right, and I like it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset.</p><p>Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5.

For people who LOVE to accessorize, this alone is a tantalizing enough feature to want to buy the phone. So of course, I bought a Pixel 10 for myself. There's no way I'd ever use it without a case though, and with a Qi2 phone like this, getting a magnetic case is essential. If you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">phone case for your Pixel 10</a>, I can't recommend these two Mous cases enough!</p><p>While I started out using the Mous Super Thin Protective Clear Case on my Pixel 10 Pro case for months, I eventually switched to the more durable Mous Clarity Protective Clear Case. I am a chronically clumsy person with butter fingers, so the textured sides of the Clarity Protective Clear Case were better suited for me. The sides have a matte, almost sandstone like finish with scored sides, creating an anti-slip effect.</p><p>Other than the features I have already mentioned, both Mous cases for the Pixel 10 also guarantee anti-yellowing over time, and seamless support with Qi2 wireless charging. In addition to that, you also get lanyard holes on both sides of the slightly more expensive Clarity Protective Clear Case.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it's also worth noting that it sports the same Exynos W100 CPU, display specs, and sensors, meaning it's not so different from the newer model.</p><p>It also includes 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, as well as the Samsung BioActive sensor which features an Optical Bio-signal sensor, an Electrical Heart Signal sensor, and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Add in dual-band GPS, Bluetooth, NFC, and up to two days of battery life, and you've got a pretty solid smartwatch for casual users at this $200 price point.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-67">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, it seems like some Pixel 10 users seem to be facing a significant software bug that seems to be impacting their Wi-Fi connectivity (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/11/27/pixel-10-quick-share-airdrop-wifi-bug/">Piunika Web</a>)</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/389198355?hl=en">users took to Google's forum</a> to report that opening the Quick Share menu immediately kills the phone's Wi-Fi connection. The user said that as soon as they opened the sharing menu to send a file, the Wi-Fi disconnected. And when they try to reconnect while the menu is open, the network list shows their network, but they won't connect to it.</p><p>According to several reports so far, this issue stems from the new Quick Share extension update (1.0.815689706). According to another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1p3320u/wifi_drooping_issues_after_installing_quick_share/">user on Reddit</a>, their Pixel 10 Pro XL began malfunctioning immediately after the Quick Share extension update. After a quick troubleshooting of the extension, they were able to confirm that the Wi-Fi issue stemmed from this update alone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-side-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What could likely be causing this issue, according to Gemini, is that the standard Wi-Fi hardware (like in the Pixel) is usually built for Wi-Fi Direct (a standard protocol). But now with this new update, Google could be forcing this hardware to emulate <strong>AWDL</strong> (a proprietary Apple protocol), which could be causing the network to get glitchy and drop out.</p><p>While Google hasn't yet officially addressed the issue, some temporary workarounds are being passed around that could help fix this issue. Pixel 10 users have two options to choose from: You can either choose to get rid of this extension until a fix arrives, by heading to <strong>Settings > Apps > See all apps</strong>, locating the "Quick Share extension," and selecting "Uninstall updates."</p><p>Or, if you urgently need to send a file to an Apple device, you can temporarily bypass the driver conflict by manually toggling your Wi-Fi off before opening the Quick Share menu; this forces the transfer to happen via Bluetooth or mobile data, though you may need to restart your phone afterward to connect back to your Wi-Fi.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issue, and we'll update this article once we have more information.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can connect your choice of smart assistant with it and create automations. I personally like to use both Alexa and Google Assistant for all my smart home devices, which is what I've done with my lamp.</p><p>The Floor Lamp can be installed multiple ways, and SwitchBot gives you a bracket and other extras in the box so you can set it up horizontally, vertically, or attach it to the wall if you like. Since it plugs in to a standard wall plug, you can set up the SwitchBot Smart Floor Lamp anywhere, be it as as a corner lamp or next to the couch to elevate and deepen the atmosphere. If you're feeling extra, you can get two lamps and set them up on either side of your TV too.</p><p>The LED Strip Lights have 3M adhesive on the back, so you can stick them wherever you please. The ideal placement would be behind the TV, which is what I prefer. Watching movies and TV shows with the strip stuck behind the TV makes the experience immersive, especially if you match the colors to the vibe of whatever it is you're watching!</p> ]]></dc:content>

In that time, the camera proved to be nothing short of a revelation, and I didn't even use all that much as an action camera, using it instead as a travel shooter.</p><p>The camera has a new 1/1.3-inch sensor that takes brilliant photos and videos, and my wife and I used the camera to take videos of our 2-year-old. We tent not to use phones that much around our toddler, so it was just easier to use the Osmo Action 5 Pro to record footage, and it did a great job in this area. The camera usually costs $349, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Standard-Waterproof-Stabilization-Touchscreens/dp/B0DBQTC2P7">discounted to $259 for Black Friday</a>, making it an absolute steal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4e2627f0-d945-4a84-a485-4f0a0e1b32fc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Thanks to a new sensor, the Osmo Action 5 Pro takes outstanding photos and videos — even in low-light conditions.

The Osmo Action 5 Pro has a high-quality sensor, image quality is excellent, and the built-in stabilization ensures you get smooth footage while doing any outdoor activities.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need an adjustable field-of-view. If that's the case, consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Essential-Variable-Aperture-Cold-Resistant/dp/B0FNMP8LZX">getting the newer Osmo Action 6</a> (it isn't discounted yet).</p><p>The Osmo Action 5 Pro is built tough; it took several tumbles over the course of the last six months, and the chassis is still pristine. It has IP68 ingress protection and withstands submersion in up to 20 meters on its own, and it's safe to say that the build quality is better than just about any other tech product I own.</p><p>The video quality is terrific; the action camera has a 155-degree wide-angle view that's pretty great during travel, and it does a good job with 4K120 footage. I didn't see any issues even with low-light situations, and you get standout slow-mo footage and excellent stabilization.</p><p>I also like the dual OLED panels; they're easy to use, and the one at the front is a nice addition — it makes framing that much more convenient. It has 47GB of built-in storage, but you can easily slot in a MicroSD card. Battery life is quite decent as well, and I didn't see problems while transferring footage to my phone. Honestly, I didn't think the action camera would be as good, and it's an easy recommendation — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Standard-Waterproof-Stabilization-Touchscreens/dp/B0DBQTC2P7">particularly now that it's down to $259</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It now appears the company may have cleared the biggest hurdle blocking the phone's U.S. availability.</p><p>When the OnePlus 15 launched on November 13, 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">OnePlus told us</a> the phone wasn't arriving in the U.S. alongside the rest of the world due to the lack of FCC clearance.</p><p>For those unaware, every electronic device sold in the U.S. must be cleared by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) before it can be sold to customers. This ensures the device meets government radio and communication standards.</p><p>However, due to the government shutdown from October 1, 2025, to November 12, 2025, OnePlus couldn't get official FCC approval for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>. Even though the phone had already passed testing at all FCC-recognized labs, the final approval from the U.S. government was pending. It now appears that approval has come through.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-finally-gains-fcc-approval-2">OnePlus 15 finally gains FCC approval</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-05" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As spotted by a user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1p7vyyu/oneplus_15_just_got_certified_by_fcc/">Reddit</a>, the FCC granted a certificate to OnePlus for a smartphone carrying the model number "CPH2749" on November 25, 2025. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fccidlookup.com/fccid/2ABZ2-OP24865">official document</a> doesn't mention the OnePlus 15 by name, this model number lines up with the device.</p><p>For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> model number in India is CPH2745, while the FCC listing shows CPH2749, which should correspond to the U.S. variant.</p><p>This theoretically means OnePlus has now obtained all required certifications to launch the phone in the U.S. OnePlus previously said that once approved, the company would try to bring the phone to "customers in the U.S. expeditiously," but we haven't heard anything official yet.</p><p>That said, we do know the OnePlus 15 will cost $899 in the U.S. once it launches officially. We're now just waiting to hear from the brand on when that will actually happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This particular deal is for the base-level 128GB storage configuration, though it also comes with a microSD port for added storage, or you can upgrade to the 256GB version.</p><p>The S10 Lite may not be included in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> index, partially just because there are so many other high-powered options out there.

The DH2300 has an elegant design, Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, plenty of power, and great software.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need M.2 storage.</p><p>Honestly, UGREEN knocked it out of the park with the DH2300. The NAS gets a new design that looks elegant, and it's extremely easy to install hard drives inside the enclosure. The NAS is powered by a Rockchip platform, and it does a great job in regular use — I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><p>While it may not have some of the extras that you see on higher-end models — like M.2 SSD slots — the DH2300 is astonishingly good. If anything, the 4GB of RAM and the internals mean it isn't anywhere as limited as you'd imagine a NAS in this category to be. Realistically, if you're just looking to store your phots and videos from your phone and other data, there isn't a need to get another NAS; the DH2300 does a terrific job in this area, and you even get NFC pairing that lets you connect your phone.</p><p>The software has plenty to offer as well, and you even get container management, so you can easily install any utilities that aren't provided by default. Having tested many entry-level models over the years, the DH2300 has proven to be a revelation, and it is without a doubt the best starter NAS around today.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DH2300-2-Bay-Capacity-Diskless/dp/B0FNWHSPXF">price coming down to $167 for Black Friday</a>, there's just no reason not to get this NAS if you're looking to get started with a home server.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, there's one Black Friday tablet deal in particular that stands out, as the Lenovo Tab One is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/"><strong>on sale for 50% off</strong></a> over at Best Buy.</p><p>Take one look at Lenovo's tablet lineup, and it's basically an encapsulation of the wide variety that Lenovo offers as a company. It all starts with budget-friendly options like the Tab One, but with a Black Friday deal like this, we're venturing into "impulse-buy" territory.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ" name="lenovo-tab-one-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo Tab One (4GB/64GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.99</del> <strong>$79.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>It's not often that I feel comfortable recommending a tablet under $100, but the Lenovo Tab One is the exception to the rule.

However, the problem with those super-cheap Fire tablets is that they lack the performance to really do much more than use one app at a time.</p><p>Thankfully, Lenovo's Tab One doesn't suffer from those problems thanks to the MediaTek Helio G85. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room for those who plan to use the tablet for more than just media consumption. And if you need more storage, there's a microSd card slot, which is just one of those "nice to have" features.</p><p>That said, this tablet is also great for catching up your favorite movies or shows with an 8.7-inch 1340 x 800 display. Lenovo also equipped the Tab One with Dolby Atmos-tuned dual speakers, providing a kind-of surround sound experience. Plus, the 5,100mAh battery is rated to last for over 12 hours on a single charge, which is better than much of the competition.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-82">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Speaking of deals, some of the newest e-readers from Amazon, launched in July, are already heavily discounted. For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G"><strong>the latest Kindle Colorsoft is available at a 32% discount</strong></a>, bringing the price down to $169. Plus, you can get it at an even better price by trading in an old Kindle for an extra 20% off!</p><p>I've been trying to squeeze in some reading early in the morning or late at night when everything's quiet, so this new Kindle has definitely caught my eye since it came out. I'm currently using the 2021<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-long-does-battery-kindle-paperwhite-last"> Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and I'd totally love a massive color upgrade. Imagine a new Kindle that not only keeps the screen glare-free but also adds a pop of color to those graphic novels! It's been this weird little thing—I really want the cover of the book on my Kindle to actually have color, making it feel like I'm holding the real copy, and I think this is as close as it gets.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.99%;"><img id="MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW" name="Kindle-Colorsoft-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="888" height="879" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99"><del><strong>$249.99</strong></del><strong> $169.99 on Amazon</strong></a></p><p>At just $169, you’re getting the full Colorsoft experience—vibrant book covers, color-coded highlights, and readable comics—without the "early adopter" premium.

And if you're into superhero comics, manga with color spreads, or if you read to your children, then this device is a game-changer.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're someone who likes to read with the text crisper, the background is whiter, and you need wireless charging on your e-reader.</p><p>This device definitely bridges the gap for comic book fans, manga readers, and people who need color to understand charts, maps, and diagrams, or who simply want to organize their notes with multi-colored highlights (yellow, orange, blue, and pink).</p><p>It allows you to enjoy the vibrant cover art of your library and read graphic novels without the eye strain of an iPad, all while retaining the glare-free, distraction-free experience, which is what we need while we read. The Kindle Colorsoft gets an immersive 7-inch Colorsoft E-Ink (Kaleido 3) display, and customizable visuals with "Standard" or "Vivid" saturation modes. The device can stay alive for 8 weeks on a single charge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="59JhccAz2TW7zqAB752jrf" name="Kindle-Colorsoft-2025" alt="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft 16 GB just hit an all-time low price of $169" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59JhccAz2TW7zqAB752jrf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="more-black-friday-deals-quick-links-12">More Black Friday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
