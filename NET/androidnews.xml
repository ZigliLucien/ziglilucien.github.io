For those who need a cheap phone right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-koala-gray/J39QWY65K6/sku/6584250" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy is offering the 2024 Motorola Razr for half off or more</strong></a> at the time of writing. If you let Best Buy activate the phone for you, you can get it for as low as $250, or for $350 if you'd prefer to connect it to your carrier on your own.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> is fairly similar to the 2025 model, with the exception of an upgraded camera suite and a better build. Still, you won't see this year's release drop to prices this low, so casual users may want to consider going last-gen.</p><p>The clamshell Razr (2024) still includes a solid Snapdragon processor, as well as the good-looking 6.9-inch pOLED display and 4-inch cover display that are included with the 2025. Plus, you'll still get a regular and telephoto lens on the rear, and a selfie camera that gets the job done.</p><p>Whether $250 or $350, these are both pretty solid prices on last year's Razr, especially for those who have been holding out for a good flip phone deal.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>See the best Black Friday deals at Best Buy (so far)</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-koala-gray/J39QWY65K6/sku/6584250" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yCeQuEhngWq6dtEz8hQUaK" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-render-koala-gray-2.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yCeQuEhngWq6dtEz8hQUaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Razr (2024):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-koala-gray/J39QWY65K6/sku/6584250" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$699.99</del> <strong>$349.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The Motorola Razr (2024) gets an early Black Friday discount at Best Buy this year, with the retailer offering the phone for as low as $250 when you let them connect it to a carrier.

It was among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones </a>last year, and it was largely used as the blueprint for the 2025 Razr release, save for a few small improvements. As such, you'll see the Razr (2024) get a whole lot of discounts like this one, though getting it for as low as $250 feels quite like a steal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A leaked version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-disable-samsung-pass-annoying-you-save-passwords-samsung-phone">Samsung Pass</a>, the brand's password manager that uses biometrics for security, suggests the app may gain support for a wide variety of ID cards and biometrics soon. With plenty of rumored feature overlap between Samsung Pass and Samsung Wallet coming in the near future, there's buzz around one app making way for the other.</p><p>The feature preview comes from user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1983981527802507529/photo/3" target="_blank">GalaxyTechie on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, who claims to have uncovered an APK for Samsung Pass version 15.3.01.6. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-pass-passport-id-storage-leak-3611987/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> points out that since the latest Samsung Pass build publicly available is v5.2.06.1, GalaxyTechie is likely actually referring to upcoming version 5.3.01.6.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[APK] Samsung Pass 15.3.01.6 adds "Personal documents" feature to safely store info such as phone number, email, ID card, ID number, driving licence, invoice, TIN, passport etc. You can add these items to Samsung Wallet as well. Front and back images of ID card can be saved. pic.twitter.com/esFFi8KtDn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983981527802507529">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The update appears to add a few new data fields to Samsung Pass, including Personal documents, Private info, and Invoice info. Some of these sections are fairly standard, with the documents section supporting uploads of IDs and passports. Users can upload front-and-back photos of their documents, and fill out fields like ID number, expiration date, issuing authority, and more.</p><p>Samsung Pass could also support other personal and business document types that aren't commonly stored in digital wallet apps. For example, the leaked APK shows interfaces for adding invoices and tax identification numbers, which could be handy for business users.</p><h2 id="will-samsung-pass-compete-with-samsung-wallet-2">Will Samsung Pass compete with Samsung Wallet?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ" name="Samsung-Wallet-close-up.jpg" alt="Samsung Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, the leaked version of the Samsung Pass upgrade isn't worth using. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1983998265222984048" target="_blank">Josh Skinner on X</a> notes that most Samsung Pass features unrelated to the new personal documents support aren't working properly. That includes password management features Samsung Cloud sync.</p><p>That being said, if these Samsung Pass features eventually earn a public release, it'll be a notable step. Samsung Pass would immediately become competitive with not only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Apple Wallet. Its support for a wide variety of document types, extending beyond simple IDs and passports, could give it a leg up over other digital wallet apps.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Samsung's plans are with Pass and Wallet, but if these leaked updates are any indication, the two apps will have more feature overlap than ever very soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But when that battery does need a top-up, how fast can you expect it to charge?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb" name="OnePlus-15-First-look" alt="OnePlus 15 first look at Qualcomm summit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The short answer is, very fast! The OnePlus 15 can be charged at an astounding 120W, provided you use the brand's own wall charger and cable that utilize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">SuperVOOC</a> protocol. Similarly, the phone supports up to 50W wireless charging with a wireless charger using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc#section-what-is-airvooc-50">AirVOOC</a> standard.</p><p>It's worth noting that both are proprietary charging protocols developed by OPPO, the sister brand of OnePlus. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger" target="_blank">third-party chargers</a>, the OnePlus 15 can be charged at 36- 55W in wired mode, based on the charging standard (e.g., PPS, PD) used by the charger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the global variant may differ in charging speed due to various reasons, so it may have a slower charging speed outside of China.</p><p>Of course, a gargantuan battery and industry-leading charging speeds are just two of the many goodies that'll make sure the OnePlus 15 earns its spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, which is complemented by up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. It also has a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with razor-thin bezels and an ultra-smooth 165Hz refresh rate. You have a triple-lens primary camera system housed in a redesigned module, IP69K dust and water resistance (just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>), and a whole lot more.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="37724a7b-5f15-47ee-b959-5934f2b030f0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The newest killer flagship</strong></em></p><p>With the latest OnePlus 15, you get a finely crafted smartphone that works even better than it looks.

While we don't have an exact date, we can expect the phones to arrive with One UI 8 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box. We can also expect that Samsung will once again offer up to seven years of OS upgrades and software updates for the phones, a software update promise that it has adopted for the past few generations of flagship phones.</p><p>This is a practice that Samsung started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. But what does this mean for you?</p><p>Well, it means you can hold onto your phone for much longer without worrying about it being outdated. When a new Samsung flagship launches, Samsung normally updates it regularly each month with a new security patch, and after some time, that cadence will slow to once a quarter and then biannual updates toward the end of its life.</p><p>Beyond monthly security patches, Samsung may occasionally provide bug fixes and feature updates. These would be separate from major OS upgrades, which normally arrive once a year with new features, updated UI elements, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Galaxy S26 series, we can then expect owners to continue receiving updates until 2032 and likely receive Android 23 or whatever the software will be called then.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that as time goes on, the aging chipset may not be able to support all the new features that are announced each year, as they will be initially designed to work on newer chipsets before Samsung tries to optimize for older devices/chips.</p><p>Fortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, which is expected to power the Galaxy S26 series, is plenty powerful and should be able to handle much of what's thrown at it over the next few years, including new AI capabilities such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic AI</a>.

But a question lingers: should you jump now, in early November's relative calm, or brace yourself for the legendary, chaotic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Black Friday deals</a> that you're <em>sure</em> are coming on November 28th?</p><p>It can seem like a modern tragedy in miniature. <em>To buy, or not to buy? That is the question</em>. But this isn't Hamlet. It's a parsing of promotional promises, and a glimpse into a future where your new pocket companion is smarter, sleeker, and of course, slightly more demanding of your wallet. It's just like a weekend in Vegas; a gamble, and trying to sort it out is like reading digital tea leaves.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-you-might-not-wait"><span>Why you might not wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-13" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The pull of immediate gratification is a powerful force. Is your current phone teetering on the brink, ready to draw its final breath? A cracked screen spider-webbed across your vision, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-how-can-i-get-more-battery-life-from-my-smartwatch">battery that drains faster than it can charge</a>, or so sluggish that tapping is a waiting game? When it's that bad, the immediacy of a new device trumps the potential savings of Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the anxiety effect. The fear that <em>your</em> phone, the one you've been meticulously researching, will vanish in a digital puff of smoke during the Black Friday frenzy. The algorithms predict demand, but sometimes, even the most sophisticated models are just wrong, and the stock sells out instantly. Buying early can seem like a form of self-care, but you need to make sure.</p><p>And let's not forget the retailers, ever eager to dip into our wallets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025">"early Black Friday" sales</a> are already upon us. It's a gamble, a game of chicken with consumerism. Are these truly discounted delights, or a clever way to exploit our temptation? Occasionally, a diamond emerges from the rough — a genuine deal that warrants immediate action. We worry that we'll miss it when we really need a new phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-black-friday-is-a-tempting-wait"><span>Why Black Friday is a tempting wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC" name="Android-Central-Black-Friday-Deals-2024" alt="Android Central's official Black Friday deals logo for 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Black Friday sales are like a Siren song. They've been etched into our consciousness, synonymous with substantial savings. We're talking price cuts averaging between 30% and 38% on electronics. And while some might scoff at percentages, consider the sheer <em>volume</em> of devices on offer and the potential for significant savings on everything from flagship marvels to budget-friendly workhorses. Chances are someone will have the phone you want on sale by Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the dark magic of carrier deals. "Free" phones dangled like a digital carrot, contingent on new lines, trade-ins, or the bundling of complicated Byzantine plans. A bargain, sometimes one that many find too tempting to resist.</p><p>And it's no longer just a single day. The "Cyber Week" period, stretching from late October through Cyber Monday, has morphed into a sprawling treasure hunt, an extended period of promotions and promises. The sheer volume of what's on offer is overwhelming, but it also presents a big opportunity for a discerning, dedicated shopper.</p><p>Armed with a little research and a dash of skepticism, you can navigate the deal deluge and come out on top, feeling like you made the right decision.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-digital-blackjack-with-real-money"><span>Digital Blackjack with real money</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d" name="Meta-Quest-2-with-cash-money.jpg" alt="Meta Quest 2 headset with lots of cash" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, what is the smart play? What is the right Black Friday strategy?</p><p>Be aware that if you crave the latest and greatest, you'll likely have to pay a premium. Black Friday may offer carrier deals on new devices, but the real savings often lie in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"> <em>last year's</em> flagships</a>. Consider your typical 2-3 year upgrade cycle. Is a slightly older, yet still powerful, device a worthwhile compromise?</p><p>If your phone is on its last legs, don't suffer. Explore existing early Black Friday deals or strong carrier trade-ins now. You might be able to save a few dollars had you waited, but you can't be sure.</p><p>If maximum savings are your ultimate goal, then Black Friday is your battleground. But be a savvy shopper:</p><p><strong>Do your homework: Research prices </strong><em><strong>before</strong></em><strong> the sales begin.</strong></p><p><strong>Read the fine print: Especially for "free" or heavily subsidized phones.</strong></p><p><strong>Consider older flagships or refurbished options for amazing value.</strong></p><p><strong>Most importantly: Track prices to ensure a genuine discount, whether you're buying now or waiting a few weeks for the "big sale".</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the decision is yours. Decide what matters most – immediate gratification, or the deepest possible discount on a slightly older model. Black Friday has evolved into an extended event, and shopping for big-ticket items has become more challenging than ever.</p><p>Me? If I needed a phone right now and a suitable device showed up at the right price today, I'd buy it. If I just wanted something new or could hold out for a few weeks, I'd wait to see what was on offer for Black Friday.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You just got a massive new video recording stability upgrade that's going to make your aging smart glasses feel like new again.</p><p>Just this week, Meta started pushing out firmware v19.2 to <strong>all</strong> Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/garmin-integration-is-rolling-out-for-oakley-meta-hstn-and-ray-ban-meta">bringing about several new features</a> like Garmin integration and additional recording options. Curiously enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/ai-glasses/1809764829519902/">the release notes</a> don't yet mention anything about adding new recording options, yet Android Central staff all seem to have them.</p><p>Central to the new options are a 60FPS recording, which launched on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> smart glasses in October, and a handful of video recording stability options. These stability options are even available on 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> glasses, giving users a free upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">one of the best features of newer Meta glasses</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwtY0iKr_tc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In the video above, I put the three new stability options side-by-side on the Ray-Ban Gen 1 glasses. Everything looks great, and even the "low" option offers significantly better stabilization than what was offered on the same glasses just last month. As you might expect, there's quite a bit of cropping that happens when using the higher stability options, which needs to be taken into account if you just want a wide-angle shot.</p><p>It's not until you compare it with the previous firmware that you really appreciate the new stability method, though. I switched the glasses back over to auto and took the same run I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> with, and the difference is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p><p>The new stability quality makes Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1's feel like a brand new pair of glasses, and the best part is that you don't have to change any settings at all. Auto is the default setting, and that's what was used to record that run in my video. It's unlikely we'll see 60FPS recording on Ray-Ban Gen 1's, but I'm not giving up hope for another free upgrade considering how great Meta has historically been about updating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> headsets in the past.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We just learned that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">push back the launch</a> of the Galaxy S26 series to February 2026 due to the late change of the Galaxy S26 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">replacing the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> in the lineup, and now there's another leak about the series, though this one might be a bummer for your wallet.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251104000392">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1985602011887518177">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>) reports that pricing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">Galaxy S26 series</a> could increase compared to the Galaxy S25 due to rising component costs. The report states that this price hike could come from the rising costs of many internal components all at once.</p><h2 id="price-hike-likely-coming-for-samsung-s-next-flagships-2">Price hike likely coming for Samsung's next flagships</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A report earlier this year cited that smartphone chipset prices have risen over 12% on average compared to last year, while camera module pricing is up nearly 8%. In addition, Mobile DRAM (LPDDR5) prices have increased nearly 16% compared to Q1 of this year due to limited supply. Adding to this, the smartphone tariff situation in the U.S. also remains uncertain.</p><p>All in all, this could mean Samsung might not be able to absorb the costs this time, resulting in higher prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> when it officially launches next year.</p><p>Samsung didn't raise prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> over the S24 lineup in January 2025. However, Samsung did increase the price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra by $100 when it launched in January 2024, so if pricing rises again, it would mark the second increase in three years.</p><p>Of course, nothing is set in stone yet, and a lot could change before the flagship smartphone series officially arrives, but it seems a price hike is on the cards. Still, Samsung may choose to swallow the extra costs, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">Pixel 10 series performing exceptionally well</a> in the States.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The most popular shape is a circular chip, featuring a hole or loop that allows for attachment to a key ring. Since they're so small and lightweight, you can even attach them to pet collars, though most brands don't advertise them as such for legal reasons.</p><p>Chipolo's keychain attachment is called the LOOP, whereas Pebblebee's take on it is called the Clip. They compete directly with the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024). I use all of these brands regularly and can say that their loudness levels are more or less the same, which is why I did not mention volume levels in my comparison.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo LOOP (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Clip Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Pro (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, replaceable CR2032 cell</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p> 40 x 57 x 8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>45 x 38 x 8.50 mm</p></td><td  ><p>59 x 34 x 7.7 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Chipolo LOOP has a superior IP rating compared to the Pebblebee Clip Universal, but it's also more expensive. Other than that, Pebblebee has the upper hand in this arena. Both charge via USB-C, but Chipolo lasts for six months on a single charge, whereas Pebblebee delivers twice as much — a whole year. Pebblebee also has a better Bluetooth range, 500 feet, as opposed to Chipolo's 400-foot range.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024) costs the same as Pebblebee's Clip and has the same range, but it has a far more heavy-duty IP68 water and dust-proof rating. Although the Tile Pro lasts for a year too, it doesn't recharge. Instead, you need to replace the CR2032 battery when it dies.</p><h2 id="sleek-trackers-for-your-wallet-2">Sleek trackers for your wallet</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3361px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RJBtjfkF9VW7ZNVADHxCrU" name="Chipolo-CARD-2025-universal-Bluetooth-tracker-charging-wirelessly-lifestyle" alt="Chipolo CARD universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS charging wirelessly on a magnetic Qi2 wireless charging stand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJBtjfkF9VW7ZNVADHxCrU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3361" height="1890" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3526px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uNdgwghJvxs92wpdRhLrVV" name="chipolo-universal-bluetooth-trackers-lifestyle-2" alt="Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNdgwghJvxs92wpdRhLrVV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3526" height="1984" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3821px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mTBwoT3YsQcT4q3LVtzYcV" name="chipolo-universal-bluetooth-trackers-lifestyle-1" alt="Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mTBwoT3YsQcT4q3LVtzYcV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3821" height="2149" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second most commonly preferred type of Bluetooth tracker is a wallet tracker. These are shaped like credit cards and can be just as slim, depending on which brand you buy from.</p><p>Chipolo's CARD stands out because not only is it rechargeable, but it features magnetic Qi wireless charging (not Qi2, just plain old Qi). I interviewed the company's co-founder and CDO about this clever contraption in detail, which you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-magnetic-wireless-charging-bluetooth-trackers-interview"><strong>read here</strong></a> if you're interested.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo CARD (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Card Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Slim (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>350ft / 100m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via Qi wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>1.5 years, rechargeable via proprietary magnetic USB-C cable</p></td><td  ><p>3 years, non-replaceable</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>85.2 x 53.6 x 2.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>96 x 106 x 14 mm</p></td><td  ><p>85.4 x 53.9 x 2.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$29.98</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's so disappointing to see that Tile couldn't figure out a way to make its card-shaped tracker rechargeable. It'll need to be disposed of after three years, meaning you'll end up buying another one and spending far more money in the long run.</p><p>Pebblebee's Card is rechargeable, but you need to use a special magnetic charging cable with a Type-C port on one end. If you lose the cable, you're done for.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chipolo's pricier CARD recharges via any Qi, Qi2, or MagSafe wireless charger. It's awesome because it's so versatile and not proprietary, so you don't have to worry about losing the cable. Despite this, it's just as thin as the Tile Slim!</p><h2 id="google-fast-pair-makes-setting-up-instantaneous-2">Google Fast Pair makes setting up instantaneous</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-1" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-2" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Setting up the universal trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee is incredibly quick and easy, thanks to Google Fast Pair and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find Hub</a>. Before you have time to process what's happening, everything sets up. You don't even need the dedicated brands' apps on your phone. Both Chipolo and Pebblebee's universal trackers are added to the Google Find Hub, and you can manage them from there.</p><p>All three brands' trackers can be used as is without purchasing a monthly subscription; however, you may not be able to make the most of them at times. Life360 offers a free membership tier, but to enjoy the best features of your Tile tracker, such as live location sharing, you must be on a paid plan for $14.99/month or $24.99/month. Chipolo has no premium plans, but Pebblebee has an Alert Live subscription that costs just $2.99/month or $24.99/year for live GPS location updates and alerts.</p><p>If you're willing to pay a premium for more than just Bluetooth tracking, Pebblebee's plan is worth the splurge.</p><h2 id="which-bluetooth-tracker-should-you-opt-for-2">Which Bluetooth tracker should you opt for?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P" name="pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle" alt="Pebblebee's universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When buying a Bluetooth tracker intended for use on a keychain, I'd say it depends on where you live. If you're in a tropical region subject to constant rainfall, it's probably best to opt for something with robust waterproofing. This would give Tile by Life360 the edge over the rest, but the Tile Pro's replaceable cell is cumbersome.</p><p>I recommend getting the Pebblebee Clip Universal instead. It's the whole package for the cheapest price among the three. You get IPX6 water resistance, a USB-C cable for charging, and a year-long battery life. I myself use the Clip on my car key fob. Pebblebee includes a sturdy key ring, which is a nice bonus.</p><p>When it comes to wallet trackers, the Chipolo CARD is the reigning champion. Tile's entry doesn't even recharge; you'll have to toss it after three years, creating e-waste. Meanwhile, the Chipolo CARD recharges wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about having your proprietary cable around like the Pebblebee Card requires. For about $4 more, you get magnetic Qi wireless charging and a vastly superior IP rating, so it's the one you should pick.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b99dad04-3600-4d78-9708-9977216e0418">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STKPs5kn2E9McaYthR8mr3.jpg' alt="Chipolo CARD (2025) universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Chipolo CARD (2025)</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="100" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Recharge it wirelessly</strong></em></p><p>The Chipolo CARD has a 400ft Bluetooth range, uses magnetic Qi wireless charging, and features a robust IP65 rating.

They offer outstanding sound quality and superb active noise cancellation, but they've always come with a few qualifiers. They're the best <em>if</em> you happen to be deep into the Apple ecosystem. They're the best <em>if</em> they fit comfortably and securely in your ears.</p><p>Apple tried to address one of these pain points with the AirPods Pro 3, and you can probably guess which one. AirPods Pro 3 aren't any friendlier with Android or Windows devices, but they do have a refreshed design with new ear tips that claim to address comfort and fit for the masses. The earbuds borrow quite a bit from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, including the insertion angle and heart-rate monitor for workout tracking.</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are said to have "the world's best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones," along with improved sound quality. After a month of testing, I can say that's probably true. However, as someone who has struggled with comfort on the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2, I'm disappointed to report that the AirPods Pro 3 aren't much better.</p><p>Testing AirPods Pro 3 with an unforgiving ear shape reminded me that standout ANC or sound quality can't compensate for weak fundamentals, such as fit. For those who find the AirPods Pro 3 comfortable and secure, these are the best-in-class earbuds.

This allows the sound to go straight into your ear canal for better quality and volume. The redesigned earbuds, packing vents that control airflow, help create a better spatial feel and improved sound quality across the board.</p><p>AirPods Pro 3 appear to use the exact same drivers as their predecessor, which Apple calls a "custom high-excursion driver." The earbuds are also powered by the same chip, the Apple H2. It may be hard to believe, but the AirPods Pro 3 really do sound better, largely due to the redesigned "multiport acoustic architecture" and fresh tuning.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-3" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can see the AirPods Pro 3 vents that help create what Apple calls a "multiport acoustic architecture." </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple uses an "Adaptive EQ" to set the sound signature for AirPods, and it isn't customizable like most earbuds. This time, the AirPods Pro 3 feature much deeper and stronger low-end frequencies with bright highs. Apple says its new Adaptive EQ "transforms the bass response" and "brings vivid vocal clarity to higher frequencies," which is readily apparent even to casual listeners when playing music with AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>I don't mind the new sound signature, although a common criticism with this style of tuning is that mids are occasionally lost through overemphasizing the lows and highs. In this case, I find that AirPods Pro 3 are exciting to listen to, even if they aren't the most balanced earbuds on the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-13" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Songs that already have a good amount of bass, like Raekwon's "Guillotine," are reproduced well without an overwhelming feel. The bass-centric audio profile seems to affect tracks that lie in the middle, such as Alessia Cara's "Slow Motion," a pop piece with a groovy baseline that AirPods Pro 3 turn into a focal point. It's also not rare to see the earbuds highlight sounds at the high end of the spectrum, which I heard from the hi-hat and ride cymbal in Supertramp's soft rock title "Oh Darling."</p><p>The problem is that, because Apple presets Adaptive EQ and you can't adjust it yourself, listeners will have no recourse if they hate it. I'm sure there are some people who will prefer the AirPods Pro 2's sound signature over the new one, and it's a shame custom EQ support isn't here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-5" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Active noise-canceling is also improved, with Apple claiming it's up to two times better than the AirPods Pro 2 and up to four times better than the AirPods Pro 3.

That said, I can use the AirPods Pro 3 on a plane in a pinch, which I haven't been able to say about other in-ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-15" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth giving Apple a tip of the cap for all the software features it added to AirPods Pro 3.

Best of all, Apple tends to upgrade AirPods over time and release software updates regularly — many of these features are also coming to AirPods Pro 2 owners for free.</p><p>As an added bonus, AirPods Pro 3 have an optical heart rate sensor for light workout tracking.

The hybrid ear tips, which feature a silicone exterior for flexibility and sweatproofing plus a foam interior that expands to fill your ear canal when inserted, work as expected. The AirPods Pro 3 are the most secure pair of AirPods I've used, and they stayed in place during a 5K run, requiring only a handful of adjustments throughout.</p><p>While they are secure, I don't find them very comfortable. To get a great seal (necessary for ANC) and a fit that won't slip out of your ears, you might need to use an ear tip size larger than you'd typically find comfortable. If you go smaller, comfort might be improved, but fitment and seal suffer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-8" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I struggled with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 fit, too, but I prefer the older models.

There are camps that find AirPods Pro 3 better, worse, and the same in terms of fit. It's unfortunate that there is a strong possibility AirPods Pro 2 owners will upgrade only to find their fit isn't as good. The only way to find out for sure is to try them in your ears firsthand.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-airpods-pro-3-competition"><span>AirPods Pro 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-10" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most, the AirPods Pro 3 will be competing with the AirPods Pro 2. The jump from AirPods Pro to AirPods Pro 2 was quite significant, but the one to AirPods Pro 3 is more modest. Apple claims the new earbuds are up to twice as effective in certain situations, which is likely due to the switch to foam ear tips for improved passive isolation, rather than a technological overhaul. The big reason to upgrade will be the redesigned earbuds, which might fit better or worse, depending on your ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2446px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-Pro-open-lids" alt="Pixel Buds Pro 2 vs Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2446" height="1376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users will be trying to decide whether AirPods Pro 3 are better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>.</p><p>The truth is, each pair first-party earbuds have their own advantages, and you should probably pick the ones that match your phone.

Most AR glasses feel like strapping a paperweight to your skull. Lenovo is betting that its new solution isn't a more powerful chip or a brighter display, but a radical focus on shedding weight.</p><p>Lenovo rolled out the AI Glasses V1 in China with a price tag of CNY 3,999 (about $562) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1050763.html" target="_blank">preorders</a> now open, with sales set to begin around November 9 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-displace-the-Rokid-Glasses-as-the-lightest-AI-AR-glasses.1152389.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). The company is positioning them as a productivity-friendly wearable rather than purely a gimmick.</p><p>The build is the first thing you’ll notice: the glasses weigh just 38 grams, making them lighter than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">leading smart glasses</a>. The lenses are only 1.8 mm thick, and Lenovo uses a resin diffraction waveguide display with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p><p>It supports a 15 × 11 mm eye-box designed to maintain stable visuals even if your head moves slightly. You also get the choice to switch between monocular or binocular display modes depending on how you wear them.</p><h2 id="built-for-productivity-ai-2">Built for productivity AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF" name="Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-on-face" alt="Lenovo AI Glasses V1 worn on face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the software and features side: the glasses are powered by Lenovo’s own Tianxi AI assistant, which handles voice commands, real-time translation (voice and on-screen text) and information search. For productivity and creators, there’s a teleprompter mode (when paired with Lenovo’s smart ring accessory you can scroll slides or prompts without looking away).</p><p>Audio and input are covered by stereo speakers built into the frame’s temples and dual microphones, and connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.4. However, some advanced features, like the navigation overlays, are currently limited to Android smartphones only.</p><p>Battery wise, Lenovo claims up to 10 hours of use in translation mode, around 4 hours in teleprompter mode, and a standby time of up to 250 hours. Charging is fast, taking about 40 minutes for a full charge.</p><p>On the flip side, to hit that ultra-lightness, Lenovo trimmed a few things: there’s no built-in camera (which some competing wearables do offer) and the battery is smaller compared to higher-profile AR headsets.</p><p>If you’re into wearable tech and like the idea of glasses that do more than sit there, the AI Glasses V1 are definitely worth watching. That said, you’ll want to wait and see how they feel in the real world and whether Lenovo brings a version for international markets and different languages.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> released, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">AYN Thor</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">AYANEO Pocket DS</a> were introduced. Now, Anbernic is joining in on the fun with the Anbernic RG DS.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEyUWDzoqq0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>At first glance, the RG DS looks almost identical to the original Nintendo DS Lite, as it's even available in a couple of the same colorways. However, no matter how hard you look for one, you won't actually be able to use those original DS cartridges. Obviously, that's not really the point, as you can download those games to your computer, transfer them to a microSD card, then put that in the RG DS.</p><p>The RG DS is equipped with dual touchscreen displays, with both the top and bottom screens measuring in at 4-inches, and coming with a 640 x 480 resolution. These are both larger than the original Nintendo DS, DS Lite, or DSi handhelds, and just a smidge smaller than the DSi XL (4.2-inches.)</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Anbernic RG DS</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Top Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Bottom Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>RockChip RK3568</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>GPU</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Mali G52-2EE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>32GB + microSD (up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh (~6 hours)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Extras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Hall Magnetic Switch for Sleep Mode, Six-axis Gyro, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Software</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p></td><td  ><p>160 x 91 x 21.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>321g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Black & Crimson Red / Turquoise Blue / Polar White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Obviously the big benefit here is that unlike the original hardware, Anbernic's RG DS is running Android. This means that you're not limited to just playing DS or DSi games, and have access to so much more. That said, we'd recommend tempering your expectations, as you'll likely start running into problems if you venture into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-your-galaxy-z-fold-3-nintendo-ds">3DS library of games</a>.</p><p>This is because Anbernic opted to rely on the RockChip RK3568, the first time we're seeing this chip in a gaming handheld. It's using practically the same CPU as the RK3566 found in the Anbernic RG353V, but with a slightly more powerful GPU.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVAHh-DmDu8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're curious as to why we don't have something like the Unisoc T820 from the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernics-next-gaming-handheld-strikes-a-nice-balance-between-budget-and-flagship">RG476H</a>, it's for good reason. Instead of trying to shoot for the moon, Anbernic went the opposite route, and managed to price this dual-screen Android-powered handheld at under $100.</p><p>Pre-orders are now open for the RG DS, and you can get one for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds">$93.99 from Anbernic</a> directly, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html">$96.99 at AliExpress</a> (with code USCD12). Anbernic says it plans to ship RG DS pre-orders "before December 15," which leads us to believe it might begin arriving sooner rather than later. And when that happens, the pre-order discounts will vanish, with the $99.99 retail price taking its place.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo" name="anbernic-rg-ds-square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG DS:</strong> <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$99.99</del> <strong>$93.99 at Anbernic</strong></a></p><p>Dreams of an Android powered Nintendo DS have been realized, and now, the Anbernic RG DS is on the way with a price that's pretty darn insane. </p><p><strong>Price check:</strong> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html"><del>$108.99</del> <strong>$96.99 at AliExpress w/ code USCD12</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

The company promoted it as for developer and research use, not for public Q&A.</p><p>But someone asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Gemma</a> a factual question: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” According to her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/5651166C-7B30-4BA0-9E86-F3DD9521CA00" target="_blank">letter</a> to CEO Sundar Pichai, Gemma answered with a wild, made-up claim: that Blackburn had pressured a state trooper for prescription drugs during her campaign, alleged non-consensual acts, and provided “news” links that turned out to be broken or unrelated (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/google-pulls-gemma-from-ai-studio-after-senator-blackburn-accuses-model-of-defamation/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Blackburn called it “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but an act of defamation.</p><p>Google responded by removing Gemma from AI Studio access (for non-developers) and reaffirmed that Gemma remains accessible only via API for developers. The tech giant stressed the model was never meant to be used as a consumer-facing Q&A tool.</p><h2 id="ai-hallucinations-strike-again-2">AI hallucinations strike again</h2><p>The incident reignites the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">broader concern about AI hallucinations</a> — when a model confidently spits out false info as fact.

These phones will be available before the end of the year and cost less than $200, making them likely choices for anyone in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, especially as we approach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 are very similar phones, both in terms of design and specs. As for what's the same, they both feature 6.7-inch 120Hz LCD panels and Motorola's more recent design language, which resembles many of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">the company's latest phones</a>. They even share the same dimensions and weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU" name="Moto-G-2026-colors" alt="Moto G 2026 colors next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G 2026 in both Panton colors. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>They're powered by the MediaTek 6300, a decent mid-range chip that should be able to handle daily use just fine, even with 4GB of RAM (which can be expanded to 12GB via RAM Boost). It's actually a big deal for the Moto G Play 2026, as it's the first time a Play model will come with 5G connectivity. It's the same chip powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, so hopefully that translates to a better experience than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review">the last Play model we reviewed</a>.</p><p>There's also a slight bump in battery capacity, which is now 5,200mAh. Motorola promises up to two days of battery life, which is certainly a draw.</p><p>Finally, both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box, with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.

Firstly, the camera system is likely a bit better on the former, as the Moto  G 2026 sports a 50MP primary camera, while the Play makes do with a 32MP sensor. Other sensors are essentially auxiliary (macro, ambient light) and likely serve only to give the phones the appearance of having more robust camera systems than they actually do, but Motorola promises "stunning results" with the AI-powered cameras.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 also has double the storage at 128GB and supports faster charging, 30W wired versus 18W on the Moto G Play 2026.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3106px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT" name="Moto-G-2026-lifestyle-1-Pantone-Cattleya-Orchid" alt="Moto G 2026 on a table next to a cup of coffee" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3106" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G 2026. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the Moto G 2026 will be available in two Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid, the latter of which is a very vibrant purple-like hue. The Moto G Play is only available in Pantone Tapestry, which is a rather muted blue. As is the norm with Motorola phones, you can expect faux leather to cover the rear, while Gorilla Glass 3 protects the front.</p><h2 id="in-time-for-the-holidays-2">In time for the holidays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D" name="Moto-G-Play-lifestyle-2-pantone-tapestry" alt="A man using a Moto G Play 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4599" height="2587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Play 2026 is the cheapest model of the two and will be available first.

The report even notes this as a "single-month sales record for the OEM."</p><p>Pixel sales in the U.S. have also been growing steadily over the past few years.

These thermostats will no longer be supported with software updates, and remote control access has been removed. They'll still function as physical thermostats, but all the Nest cloud features that made them special are gone.</p><p>To soften the blow, Google offered owners of affected Nest Learning Thermostats $130 off the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">a new fourth-generation model</a>. For many, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">that wasn't enough</a>. There's a free and open-source project that aims to keep older Nest Learning Thermostats up and running, and it may be the lifeline fans were hoping for.</p><p>It's called the "NoLongerEvil Thermostat" on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and it's the creation of developer Cody Kociemba (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/03/google-nest-thermostat-old-revive-project/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The project allows savvy users to flash a modified bootloader and kernel components onto their Nest Learning Thermostat, redirecting network traffic from Google's server to its own NoLongerEvil website. It was developed by reverse-engineering the Nest API.</p><p>"By intercepting the communication layer, the thermostat believes it's communicating with the official Nest infrastructure, but instead connects to the NoLongerEvil platform," the GitHub page explains. "This approach ensures full compatibility with the device's existing software while breaking free from Google's cloud dependency."</p><p>Notably, this is still an experimental project and is currently in the testing phase. The project's developers warn that users should not try the firmware on any thermostat that is crucial for heating and cooling. "Only proceed if you have a backup thermostat or can afford to have your device non-functional during testing," the page cautions.</p><h2 id="what-nolongerevil-thermostat-can-do-2">What NoLongerEvil Thermostat can do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.83%;"><img id="vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9" name="No-Longer-Evil-Website" alt="The NoLongerEvil website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2420" height="1714" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NoLongerEvil)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This project will soon be fully open-sourced, but you can get started testing it now. The website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nolongerevil.com" target="_blank">nolongerevil.com</a> brings back support for setting temperatures and modes remotely, plus viewing the status of your thermostat. It's designed to be installed as a progressive web app (PWA) on mobile devices, so it'll work on everything from Android phones to PCs.</p><p>While the process requires a bit of know-how, like entering DFU mode on your thermostat and flashing new software, it does restore the functionality Google removed last month. When it's widely available as open-source software, this project will serve as a baseline for tinkerers to regain control of their unsupported Nest thermostats.</p><p>"Fork the code, modify it, break it, rebuild it, share it," the project's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nolongerevil.com/about" target="_blank">about page</a> states.

If it happens, you might one day use Google Photos not only to revisit memories but also to restyle yourself—uploading outfit photos, comparing looks, and generating new combinations based on your existing wardrobe.</p><p>It’s not confirmed yet, but it hints at how Google is quietly turning Photos into something that feels more like a personal visual assistant.</p><p>At the moment, Ask Photos itself is still limited. The feature is currently available only in the United States and can be accessed via a separate Ask tab in the Photos app for users who meet the eligibility requirements.</p><p>The dedicated shortcut button discovered in the teardown hasn’t been officially announced, meaning it might take a while before users outside the U.S. see it. Likewise, the Outfits collection and Doppl integration are speculative for now, since early code references don’t always translate into a public rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's also likely that this language expansion opened up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/5-best-ai-features-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7#:~:text=the%20Edge%20Panel.-,Call%20Assist,-There%27s%20one%20AI">Call Assist</a>, too.</p><p>With that, users can screen calls and see a transcription of what the person (or bot) on the other side is saying. Live Translate comes into play, translating the text to your preferred language. Galaxy AI's language expansion is making its rounds globally to users looking for it. Samsung says Gujarati and Filipino will appear as a language pack for Galaxy AI in your Settings app.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-for-all-2">Galaxy AI for all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:585px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="p8jCZ99fsjaaXvokqZTuwA" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-language-expansion-22-supported" alt="Galaxy AI now supports 22 languages for even more global support." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8jCZ99fsjaaXvokqZTuwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="585" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of Galaxy AI, an update earlier this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-update-brings-gemini-live-capabilities-to-samsung-galaxy-s25-users">brought Gemini Live</a> to the Galaxy S25 series. That update made it possible for the latest flagship phone owners to lean on Google's AI for visual assistance. In real-time, users can converse with Gemini and see their questions answered on the fly, as they move from subject to subject. Moreover, users can now trigger the AI's Live mode by pressing and holding their side button.</p><p>Also, as a bit of good news for Galaxy phone owners, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-phone-users-rejoice-as-your-galaxy-ai-features-are-likely-staying-free">confirmed this summer</a> that its default features will remain free. This promise lumps in Live Translate, Note Assist, and several more. You might remember that there were rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-plans-to-charge-for-certain-galaxy-ai-features-after-two-years">was looking to charge for its Galaxy AI features</a> in two years (the original report was from 2024). Now, the company's walked back on that, doing something that Google has opted not to do, as it's deployed a few AI subscriptions already.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gurman reports the new Siri rollout is roughly tabbed for March 2026, and could launch with iOS 26.4 next spring. However, the collaboration between Google and Apple is said to be much different from its arrangement with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration.</p><p>Bloomberg reaffirms that custom Google Gemini models are planned to run on Apple's own Private Cloud Compute servers. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> integration, Apple will securely control user data and complete requests on its PCC hardware and software, which is publicly made available for peer security reviews. By comparison, when iPhone users tap into Apple Intelligence's ChatGPT integration, they are opting-into OpenAI's data sharing policies.</p><p>The custom Gemini models will reportedly serve as a planner and summarizer, powering two out of three main components of the upcoming Siri revamp. The third, a knowledge search system, could also use Gemini models, but that is not confirmed.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Speaking of Apple and AI. The new Siri is planned for March give-or-take, as has been the case for months. Apple has been saying for 9 months it’s coming in 2026. Apple simply reiterated that on the earnings call. Nothing new but for some reason sparked headlines. https://t.co/eQm14rGB9E<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1985374715977089078">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Gurman noted in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) that the report is "nothing new," but at the very least, it is a confirmation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple's release schedule is still on track for 2026</a>. Apple confirmed as much on its most recent earnings call. However, Apple's Siri redesign was first announced more than a year ago and faced numerous delays. It was initially marketed as an iPhone 16 series feature to debut with iOS.</p><p>Since then, iOS users flocked to Google AI products, with Gemini becoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">the top free app for iPhone</a> in September 2025.</p><p>The delays were major enough that the iPhone 16 has been replaced with the iPhone 17, and yet the new Siri is still nowhere to be found. Apple was forced to walk back its iPhone 16 claims about Siri in March 2025 by adding a disclaimer to iPhone and Apple Intelligence product pages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/apple-website-siri-features-fine-print/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>). So, the comments from Apple and Gurman's latest report do hold weight as evidence that the Siri upgrade is still penned  for early next year.</p><h2 id="why-apple-wants-gemini-2">Why Apple wants Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8" name="Apple-Intelligence-vs-Gemini" alt="The Apple Intelligence & Siri menu beside a Pixel running Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's in-house large language models (LLM) and foundational models are seen as lacking compared to the competition.

That's not the only major event coverage YouTube TV users will go without if the two companies can't come to an agreement. Election Day in the U.S. is today, Nov. 4, and Disney is requesting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> restore access to ABC — one of the four major news networks — for one day only as a result.</p><p>Google denied that request with a public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/" target="_blank">statement</a>, also sent to Disney leadership, that serves as a counteroffer. The company says Disney's proposal would "cause customer confusion" by having ABC return for a day and the channel disappearing immediately after. Instead, Google is proposing that Disney restore both ABC and ESPN indefinitely on YouTube TV while the two sides negotiate.</p><p>"There are plenty of other options for customers — election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free," Google's statement reads. "In fact, on the last two U.S. election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC."</p><p>Google's email emphasizes that it could restore ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV "in hours" if Disney agrees to the proposal, just in time for Election Day coverage. It also claims that ABC could alternatively livestream its coverage for free on YouTube.</p><div><blockquote><p>Publicly resorting to the same tactic that Disney relied on in past disputes fails to acknowledge the distinction between YouTube and other distribution platforms. As you know, Disney can continue to livestream news information on the ABC News YouTube page, which has 19.1M subscribers, and its ABC local stations can also do so on their YouTube pages.</p><p>Google</p></blockquote></div><p>Google's response follows the earlier proposal from Disney, which would only see ABC return for 24 hours. In a statement to Deadline, Disney explained its position on the matter, saying it wants to put the negotiations aside for a day for the sake of public interest.</p><p>"Despite the impasse that led to the current blackout, we have asked YouTube TV to restore ABC for Election Day so subscribers have access to the information they rely on," a Disney spokesperson said in the statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-youtube-tv-blackout-abc-election-day-1236605420/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>.

I got this charger the other day and was pleased to find out that it works with both Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Compatible-Headliner-Accessories-Indicator/dp/B0FL7HQVRB/"><strong>now it's on sale for a few bucks off at Amazon, making it just over $30.</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Why get a charging dock when the glasses already have a charging case? The answer is so that you never run into a situation where both your glasses and the charging case run out of battery. This ingenious little dock makes it simple to drop your glasses and the case on the dock the moment you walk in your front door and then pick them up again from a convenient location on your way out.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5da4497e-70d2-49c3-b7cc-e58aa13fe4e5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Celebrate the launch of the AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock with a 10% off coupon on Amazon!

I found that the charger is a few minutes faster to hit both 50% and 100% charge for each the glasses and the case. That means if your glasses end up with a dead battery when you walk in the door it only takes 17 minutes to hit a 50% charge. That's just enough to last for quite some time if you find yourself out and about for a few hours and still want to carry your glasses with you.</p><p>The front of the dock has a nose piece clip that looks essentially identical to what you'll find inside of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses charging case. The glasses click nicely into place and a charging LED on the front of the dock lets you know that your glasses are charging by turning from green to red. Once the glasses are all charged up, that same LED will turn green. There's a second LED next to it to show the status of the charging case and each of these LEDs has a handy symbol above it so that you never are guessing which LED goes to which device</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7aX8553hiyEQTpZunVbJAD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-back-with-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aX8553hiyEQTpZunVbJAD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gNX4jC59SHyXWWC5NwGa9D" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-magnetic-connector-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNX4jC59SHyXWWC5NwGa9D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wVpniuZjvaEJsAEeLZ5BCD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-magnetic-connector-case-02" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVpniuZjvaEJsAEeLZ5BCD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U6n8zyqKy2h6KVxT8Yiw3D" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-pins-for-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6n8zyqKy2h6KVxT8Yiw3D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LTf4FKrpwYvh9Uut75Z2DD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-pins" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTf4FKrpwYvh9Uut75Z2DD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Popping the charging case into the dock is just as simple thanks to a clever magnetic USB-C connector that ships in the box. AMVR even includes a second one of these in the box just in case you lose the first one, which is always a possibility given how small these little dongles are. I've used these kinds of magnetic charging docks with my Meta Quest in the past and it's amazing how handy it is to just be able to drop the case on the dock and have it charge. It's like a wireless charging magnetic connector for your phone except in this case it's purpose built for the Ray-Ban Meta charging case.</p><p>Well this one does work with all generations of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, it doesn't work with Oakley Meta smart glasses or the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses. Those cases are not the right size and shape and they simply won't fit on the dock, although they will charge Oakley Meta HSTN glasses if you happen to have a pair of those. Just not the large charging case that comes with those glasses.</p><p>There aren't too many accessories for the smart glasses just yet but clever manufacturers like AMVR well no doubt come up with more ideas as we get more of these products. AMVR in particular makes some of my favorite Meta Quest accessories and I have no doubt that they will continue to talk the list of Ray-Ban Meta accessories as time passes.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><u><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><u><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><u><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><u><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

To recap, the present issue regards the in-call button within the Phone app on the previously mentioned Pixel phones. Users reported over the summer with the Pixel 10 that the button is "unresponsive" and, at other times, "laggy."</p><p>It's been incredibly frustrating for users who purchased the recent Pixel 10 series to have to repeatedly tap the speaker button to get it to work (and in other cases, it doesn't). Unfortunately, users were reporting this back in May with the Pixel 9 series, too.</p><p>Users have taken to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/441823037?pli=1#comment8">Issue Tracker</a> to voice their displeasure with the problem and to provide the necessary material to help the company fix it. This thread was made back in August, and Google continued to return to it for two months, until just recently, when not "enough actionable information" was given. Users quickly chirped back today (Nov 3), stating the "severe latency" with the speakerphone is unacceptable. They've highlighted reports on online forums, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n3gkt0/pixel_10_pro_xl_during_a_full_screen_call/">reports from Reddit</a>, which PunikaWeb brings up.</p><p>Another user with a Pixel 9 says they experience this problem within the Phone app without fail. According to the publication, there is one workaround: tap the speakerphone in the notification, not through the in-call screen.</p><h2 id="problems-aplenty-2">Problems aplenty</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roEZdZhdjkhBBc2v3GQXxV" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-jade-03" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roEZdZhdjkhBBc2v3GQXxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This speakerphone problem isn't the only one Pixel 10 users have had to deal with, as reports in October <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-camera-gets-the-shakes-in-user-bug-reports">highlighted its shaky camera</a>. The Pixel 10 Pro's cameras got the shakes last month, with user reports stating its EIS (electronic image stabilization) was having issues within the API. As a result, filming with the Pixel 10 Pro often delivered a shaky, often slightly blurry result.</p><p>EIS is meant to smooth out those micromovements we have when holding things (we're human, you know?), but that's not happening correctly. The issues were extremely noticeable when using 5x zoom, and even still with 2x.</p><p>There's hope that Google is working on a fix for this for the November security patch, but there's nothing confirmed. Elsewhere, Pixel users reported that their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-random-app-crashes-oct-2025">apps were crashing</a> following the October patch. Speculation said there was a conflict between Google Play Services and last month's patch. The only "fix" users reported was to uninstall the then-latest Play Services and Play Store updates. Just like the other problem, we're holding out hope for a fix in November.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, this is in regard to the "economics" of pay-TV, per an executive the post cites. The exec told Deadline in a statement that, regarding Disney, "There are aspects of their portfolio that are doing well on our platform." However, everything isn't so clean cut, as they add that their "broad portfolio" may contain channels where viewership may "decline" or become "non-existent."</p><p>It's because of this thinking that the exec reportedly informed the publication that Disney was expecting "steep carriage fees," despite its viewership dropping a bit in recent years. Disney has also reportedly dismissed this statement, saying that it's actually tried to offer services that "lower" costs for the consumer.</p><p>Apparently, there were some rumors about Disney potentially using its acquisition of Fubo, as well as Hulu Live, as "leverage" for its current negotiations with YouTube TV. A Disney executive reportedly cut down that theory, stating YouTube TV was “intentionally misrepresenting the situation."</p><p>From the recent reports, it seems clear that consumers are going to have to continue waiting for a YouTube TV, Disney agreement. Even the fate of ESPN on the platform is in the air, which doesn't bode well for sports lovers.</p><h2 id="no-middle-ground-disney-s-channels-disappear-2">No middle ground, Disney's channels disappear</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mnZtoLc7iBLt5e3Ugx56hQ" name="disney-plus-logo-169.png" alt="Disney+ logo with blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnZtoLc7iBLt5e3Ugx56hQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1119" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central has reached out to YouTube TV and Disney about the latest stalemate report and will update this post if we hear back.</p><p>Last week, we were rapidly approaching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">the deadline for a content deal</a> between YouTube TV and Disney. The former claimed it had entered negotiations with the latter in order to keep channels like ABC and ESPN for its subscribers. However, similar to what we've heard today in the recent report, YouTube TV claimed Disney's proposals would've led to a price hike for viewers.</p><p>Still, Disney pointed the blame at YouTube TV, stating it was "exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers."</p><p>Both sides had until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to reach some sort of middle ground, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disney-channels-disappear-from-youtube-tv-as-the-sides-fail-to-reach-deal">but that didn't happen</a>. With the contract up, viewers lost 21 channels, including ABC and ESPN. YouTube TV and Disney delivered their own statements, each defending their stances, which only lengthens this blackout for consumers. According to Disney, "Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor."</p><p>It's a similar sentiment we've heard Deadline report from a Disney exec.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Like the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, the XL also now supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a>, and the phone's battery life is better than ever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uZa7fAnCBYDpUsbrVwzEzU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-02" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL basking in the sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZa7fAnCBYDpUsbrVwzEzU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other end of things, the Google Pixel 10 series does still lag behind certain Android phones when it comes to gaming performance and max processing speeds, and some folks aren't going to be happy about the Pixel 10 being restricted to eSIM-only in the United States. </p><p>Moreover, this Mint Mobile deal only really works if you're cool committing to the T-Mobile-owned carrier for a full year. I, for one, have no problem using the popular MVNO for twelve months if it means I can score 50% off the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

You get unlimited talk, text, and data powered by the world's largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and unlimited calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK.

Google is rolling out enhanced autofill for Chrome starting today, Nov. 3, and it bolsters Chrome's capabilities. The feature saves more information from data fields in common forms, like a driver's license number, passport number, or vehicle information.</p><p>For people who hate pulling out their driver's license to find their ID number or the walk to the car to check their license plate again, enhanced autofill in Chrome is there. The feature is available for certain forms and supports storing driver's license and passport numbers as well as vehicle license plate numbers and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). When you enter these fields for the first time, a prompt will appear offering to save that information with enhanced autofill in Chrome.</p><p>"If you choose to turn on enhanced autofill, Chrome understands forms better and can autofill the fields faster for you," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893" target="_blank">support document</a> explains. "This autofill feature can offer to save info when you submit forms, like your driver’s license, passport, or vehicle info."</p><p>Enhanced autofill is turned off in Chrome by default. To enable it, you'll need to click the three-dot menu in the browser on a computer and navigate to <strong>Settings > Autofill and passwords</strong>. From there, users can click <strong>Enhanced autofill</strong> and flip the toggle beside it to turn it on.</p><p>Google says this feature is designed to be "private and secure," and that user data is encrypted. Prompts offering to save supported data kinds will only appear after you've manually flipped the toggle, and you'll still need to confirm again before it is finally added to enhanced autofill.</p><p>The company adds that site URLs and content may be shared with Google when you visit a site with a form and enhanced autofill is enabled. The information is used "to provide you with better autofill suggestions and improve enhanced autofill."</p><h2 id="see-enhanced-autofill-in-chrome-in-action-2">See enhanced autofill in Chrome in action</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nqembxZetwDrmu9cHrPbsA" name="Enhanced-Autofill-Chrome-2" alt="Enhanced autofill in Chrome autofilling driver's license info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nqembxZetwDrmu9cHrPbsA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users who want to try enhanced autofill in Chrome can wait to encounter a supported form or manually enter it.

Samsung controls a sizeable chunk of this category thanks to its strong presence in the U.S., and seeing as how its immediate rivals don't sell in the region, it is unchallenged.</p><p>That isn't the case globally, and Huawei and Vivo are making positive moves with their own foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> is one of my favorite devices of 2025, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is arguably the most innovative phone around. Having used the tri-folding device over the course of 2025, I'm excited to see Samsung make its debut in this category.</p><p>Samsung confirmed it is rolling out the device, and while we don't have the name yet, it may be dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold. I talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/heres-i-want-to-see-in-samsungs-tri-fold-phone">what I want to see in the Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and here I'm rounding up all the latest leaks and details around the upcoming foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks around the design of the Galaxy Z TriFold point to a device that's similar to the Z Fold 7, but with an added panel, bringing the overall size of the device when unfolded to 10 inches. That basically means you get a tablet-sized device that folds down to a phone, and that unlocks a set of new use cases.</p><p>I routinely use my Mate XT fully unfurled, and it's just great to be able to access that kind of real estate in a foldable device. Samsung is said to be using a G-styled hinge that has a dual in-folding mechanism.</p><p>The panel itself should be similar to what's there on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and we'll have to wait and see if Samsung adds DC dimming.

Samsung controls a sizeable chunk of this category thanks to its strong presence in the U.S., and seeing as how its immediate rivals don't sell in the region, it is unchallenged.</p><p>That isn't the case globally, and Huawei and Vivo are making positive moves with their own foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> is one of my favorite devices of 2025, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is arguably the most innovative phone around. Having used the tri-folding device over the course of 2025, I'm excited to see Samsung make its debut in this category.</p><p>Samsung confirmed it is rolling out the device, and while we don't have the name yet, it may be dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold. I talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/heres-i-want-to-see-in-samsungs-tri-fold-phone">what I want to see in the Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and here I'm rounding up all the latest leaks and details around the upcoming foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks around the design of the Galaxy Z TriFold point to a device that's similar to the Z Fold 7, but with an added panel, bringing the overall size of the device when unfolded to 10 inches. That basically means you get a tablet-sized device that folds down to a phone, and that unlocks a set of new use cases.</p><p>I routinely use my Mate XT fully unfurled, and it's just great to be able to access that kind of real estate in a foldable device. Samsung is said to be using a G-styled hinge that has a dual in-folding mechanism.</p><p>The panel itself should be similar to what's there on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and we'll have to wait and see if Samsung adds DC dimming. The design shouldn't be all that different either — there are only so many ways to make a foldable, after all — and we could see a similar camera island at the rear.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-official-look" alt="Press renders of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It isn't astonishing to think the Galaxy Z TriFold leverage the latest hardware.

The model picker currently has "Fast" and "Advanced" selections, with the latter being the default option. Following the Google Translate app tweak, users will be able to tap below the Google Translate logo to switch between models.</p><p>Google calls these additions "text-translation models," with the Advanced version offering "high accuracy for complex translations." Users can switch to the Fast alternative, which is "best for quick translation." The model picker isn't showing up for everyone yet. 9to5Google discovered it on the iOS version of the Google Translate app, but it hasn't appeared for Android Central on either the iOS or Android apps yet.</p><p>The choice of text-translation models will only apply to typed translation requests, as the name suggests. At the bottom of the model switcher, there's a disclaimer explaining the following: "Advanced is supported for text translation only in select languages." It's unclear which languages are currently supported, if the model picker is restricted to paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra subscribers</a>.</p><p>As the model switcher is for text-only requests, it won't affect live translation, a feature that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/airpods-pro-3-vs-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-best-for-live-translate">gaining popularity across translation tools</a> and brands. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a> users can take advantage of live translation, but they can't manually pick the translation model powering the feature.</p><h2 id="first-look-at-the-google-translate-model-picker-2">First look at the Google Translate model picker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yypHeNaZWoQ5Y8uAV8GyD5" name="Google-Translate-Model-Picker-9to5Google" alt="Screenshots of the new model picker in Google Translate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yypHeNaZWoQ5Y8uAV8GyD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the screenshots from 9to5Google above, a pill appears under the Google Translate model noting the text translation model currently active.

Google used its Veo 3 video-generation model to make a TV commercial for AI Mode in Search, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-first-ai-ad-avoids-the-uncanny-valley-by-casting-a-turkey-dafd3662?AID=15734583&PID=6159661&SID=mhiraf0c5g010l040023y&subid=Sovrn+Inc&cjevent=e937eb67b87d11f081f201770a1eba22&tier_1=affiliate&tier_2=moa&tier_3=Sovrn+Inc&tier_4=2470763&tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fgoogles-first-ai-ad-avoids-the-uncanny-valley-by-casting-a-turkey-dafd3662" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/31/google-ai-tv-ad/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The advertisement is currently running on television channels, movie theaters, and on social media as of Nov. 1, 2025. While Google has shown off its generative AI tools plenty, this represents the brand's first ad created entirely with AI.</p><p>The commercial shows how holiday travelers can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-finds-new-shortcut-google-digs-deep-with-its-search-model">Google Search's AI Mode</a> to research and make plans ahead of the Thanksgiving season. It's complete with a toy turkey that's trying to flee the Thanksgiving harvest using AI Mode. The ad is titled "Planning a Quick Getaway?" and will be the first of a series, with a Christmas version to come.</p><p>"When your plans can’t wait, and you need the answer right away, AI Mode in Google Search can help you find flight and hotel information from the web, no matter how specific," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWlfmUrazFw" target="_blank">YouTube video's description</a> explains.

Google Search returns city names, and the ad follows Tom's journey away from Thanksgiving celebrations. Notably, there are no people in the ad, and video generation models often trip up when trying to recreate humans.</p><p>Google isn't shying away from the fact that this AI Mode ad was created with AI, but it isn't advertising it either. The YouTube video has a standard disclosure for "altered or synthetic content," but Google doesn't point out that Veo 3 was used specifically.</p><p>This was intentional, according to the Wall Street Journal report. Robert Wong, the vice president of Google Creative Lab, told the publications consumers don't care whether an ad was made with AI or not.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">Veo 3</a>, the video-generation model used to make the AI Mode ad, is widely available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">following a Google I/O 2025 announcement</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The app marketplace is surfacing AI-powered summaries for app reviews.</p><p>Now, instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">scrolling through lots of five-star praise or unclear one-star complaints</a>, users will see a short paragraph under a new section called “Users are saying,” as discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/play-store-ai-generated-review-summaries-3611995/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. This feature highlights the main pros and cons from app reviews, combining feedback from different ratings into a single summary.</p><p>The summaries appear beneath the "Ratings and reviews" section on select app pages and are powered by Google’s in-house AI models. They’re designed to capture both praise and criticism — for instance, pointing out that users love an app’s interface but have reported frequent crashes or slow performance.</p><p>Below the summary, you may see small buttons that let you filter reviews by topics like performance, design, or stability.</p><h2 id="gradual-rollout-underway-2">Gradual rollout underway</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.85%;"><img id="MkPeS82XPaWyRnyGL3CFMQ" name="Google-Play-Store-AI-generated-review-summaries" alt="AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkPeS82XPaWyRnyGL3CFMQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="655" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.85%;"><img id="hvwXZcA5DWcscXYVoNy2NQ" name="Google-Play-Store-AI-generated-review-summaries" alt="AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvwXZcA5DWcscXYVoNy2NQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="655" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Android Authority reports that this feature is currently available to some users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Play Store</a> version 48.5.23-31, which suggests it is being rolled out gradually. For now, only a few apps have this feature, so not everyone will see it yet.</p><p>This rollout is another sign of Google’s bigger AI push across its platforms. After bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-on-android-gemini-summaries-questions-update">AI summaries to Google Docs</a>, Gmail, and Search, among others, the Play Store is the latest stop in Google’s mission to make information easier to digest.</p><p>The company hopes to help users make faster, more informed download decisions without wading through repetitive feedback. That’s especially useful for popular apps with tens of thousands of reviews, where manually browsing can feel like a chore. So, while Google’s AI won’t tell you what to download, it’ll make sure you get there faster and a little less frustrated.</p><p>Still, there are a few caveats. These AI summaries only appear for apps that have enough review data for the system to analyze, meaning smaller or newer apps might be left out for now. And because the summaries are machine-generated, they could occasionally miss context or misrepresent niche opinions as common trends.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company launched in March 2025 globally and it took a few extra months for the phone to make its way stateside. It's possible that if the Galaxy A57 is tabbed for a U.S. launch, customers there could have to wait longer than those in global markets.</p><h2 id="what-do-we-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-a57-so-far-2">What do we know about the Samsung Galaxy A57 so far?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not much is known about the Samsung Galaxy A57 as of now, but expect leaks to intensify closer to the new year as the phone's launch window creeps closer.

A public test build of firmware v83 just rolled out to users this week and may finally have a solution to a problem that was keeping Quest gamers from enjoying their headsets.</p><p>In a nutshell, Quest games would randomly crash, giving users a "low memory" error that didn't seem to make sense. Reports have been piling up on Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ContractorsExfilZone/comments/1lc1qz3/meta_quest_3_low_memory_error/">since roughly May</a>, with users noting that the v76 firmware update seems to have caused it. Meta has released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">several bad updates</a> to Quest headsets this year, but the latest v83 update may be a light at the end of the long tunnel.</p><p>Some users have surmised that this problem began with the "seamless multitasking" feature Meta introduced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/172903867975450/?srsltid=AfmBOorpmXhXIHfvjDFxzfPioYnyRHJTetWls23Uobj6tEqlp1AaaJTL">v74 update in February</a>, which allowed Quest owners to run floating windows while they were playing VR games. This made it possible to look up YouTube videos or run chat apps while playing games, making the Quest feel more like a PC VR experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozpQdTvob4SEHGQNw4E8A8" name="meta-quest-3-ui-with-asgards-wrath-2-youtube-video" alt="Running three windows while playing Asgard's Wrath 2 on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozpQdTvob4SEHGQNw4E8A8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When my Meta Quest 3 got the v83 public test firmware this week, I noticed that the seamless multitasking feature was no longer in the <em>experimental</em> settings section. Sure enough, it looks like Meta has marked this one as no longer a beta feature and has launched it as part of the big UI overhaul, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/133727602066940/?srsltid=AfmBOoqD2PkUlcGIj129pZ3kLFIVFYjDBVmq5-Dz1ko-TbHXNUc6cEIk">called Navigator</a>.</p><p>To test this out, I charged up my Meta Quest 3 and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Adjustable-Headband-Accessories-Playtime-PC/dp/B0D4TGY2F2/">Kiwi Design K4 headstrap</a>, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard's Wrath 2</a> (the largest game on the Quest), and then loaded up a bunch of YouTube videos, a browser window with X (Twitter) loaded, as well as the Meta Horizon discovery feed. You can see a screenshot of my setup above.</p><p>I then let the headset run with all this happening until it completely died, checking every 20 minutes and moving around in the game to ensure things were still working. After all those hours, I never saw Asgard's Wrath 2 crash. Instead, when memory clearly got low during a loading sequence in the game, the 2D apps reloaded themselves.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="JU3n6XuedVhaLgrXaPAHDL" name="meta-quest-v83-navigator" alt="An official screenshot of the new Navigator menu in Meta Quest v83 firmware" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JU3n6XuedVhaLgrXaPAHDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll need wider testing and user reports to ensure the bug has been properly squashed, but I'm feeling pretty confident after this test that this massive problem has finally been resolved.</p><p>I would <em>not</em> recommend users switch to PTC v83 unless they're already on the channel, as you have to perform a full factory reset in order to go back to stable firmware. Meta typically rolls out these public test firmware versions 2-3 weeks after they enter public testing, so I would expect all users to receive this update sometime later in November.</p><p>In the meantime, apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer">Quest Games Optimizer</a> may also help. If you're testing v83, let us know if you find the system to be more stable and if the low memory crashing problems are gone! We'll continue testing until then.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This could be changing. Google is apparently developing a new feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a>, internally dubbed "Min Mode," set to completely transform your phone's idle screen into an interactive, full-screen hub.</p><p>According to findings by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-aod-min-mode-rumor-3611806/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Min Mode is designed to let full-screen apps display simplified, ultra-efficient interfaces right on the AOD. Instead of just showing a static clock, your phone could soon keep live navigation, workout stats, or media controls visible even when the screen is technically off.</p><p>Min Mode is more like an alternate mode rather than a replacement for the traditional AOD. When your phone goes idle, Android 17 will check which app you were using. If that app supports Min Mode, it can take over the AOD using a special process registered through new system components called MinModeActivity and MinModeProvider. This allows apps to display minimal, low-refresh-rate UIs while staying within the same low-power environment that makes AOD efficient.</p><p>Digging through the Android 17 code, the outlet found that the system shifts each pixel by one pixel every 60 seconds to prevent burn-in.</p><h2 id="google-maps-leads-the-charge-2">Google Maps leads the charge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:987px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.31%;"><img id="ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta" name="Google-Maps-power-saving-mode" alt="monochrome view of Google Maps' new power saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="987" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From what’s been uncovered so far, Google Maps looks to be one of the first apps ready to take advantage of this new feature. Code references like com.google.android.apps.gmm.features.minmode.MinModeActivity suggest that Maps will be able to display simplified turn-by-turn directions directly on the AOD, so your route stays visible even when the phone’s main display turns off.</p><p>Early UI hints <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-testing-a-battery-saving-mode-youve-always-needed">show a stripped-down, monochrome design</a> with limited interactivity and no landscape support. It’s a subtle but practical step toward making the lock screen more useful without draining your battery.</p><p>This essentially turns the AOD into a lightweight extension of whatever task you were doing before locking your phone. Of course, Google will need to manage how much freedom developers get — too much clutter or constant activity could ruin the balance between visibility and battery efficiency that AOD is known for.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But where its rivals famously compromised, the Edge 70 is showing up with a feature that thin phones almost never have: a massive battery.</p><p>The main selling point of the Motorola Edge 70 is its body, which is ridiculously thin at just 5.99mm, and it weighs only 159 grams. The frame is aircraft-grade aluminum, the front is Gorilla Glass 7i, and the back has a unique nylon-textured finish.</p><p>It also packs both an IP69 rating for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD 810H durability.

That’s a huge capacity for any phone, let alone one this thin. It also supports 68W wired charging and 15W wireless.</p><p>However, this isn't a flagship-spec monster. It’s a strategic mid-range play, running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-launches-snapdragon-7-gen-4">new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset</a>, paired with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of storage. The display is a 6.67-inch pOLED panel with a 2712 x 1220 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 4,500 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Camera-wise, you get a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide with macro capabilities, and a 50MP selfie camera. It ships with Android 16 alongside a promise of four major OS updates and six years of security patches.</p><p>The global version of what was the China-only X70 Air, the Edge 70 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/pl/pl/p/phones/motorola-edge/motorola-edge-70/pmipmjc43m9" target="_blank">priced at €799/£699</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_lists_edge_70_along_with_its_full_specs_on_its_official_website-news-70074.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Motorola is taking a big risk with this launch.

The company has had its hands full with seeding One UI 8 to older Galaxy phones, a process that was paused and resumed in October. Now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 are finally receiving the October 2025 security patch as of Oct. 31, 2025.</p><p>The update is rolling out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> owners in Europe, with more regions set to follow. The build number is <strong>F741BXXS2CYJ1</strong> for the Flip 6 and <strong>F956BXXS2CYJ1</strong> for the Fold 6, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-get-october-2025-security-update/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. The update size for both devices should be fairly small since each phone received the bigger boost to One UI 8 previously.</p><p>The patch comes with 14 fixes for security vulnerabilities included in the Android Security Bulletin, all of which are of a "high" severity level. Samsung adds 20 patches of its own that are specific to Galaxy devices, and they all have either "high" or "moderate" severity levels. As the fixes aren't available for everyone yet, we don't have details for every security vulnerability addressed in the October 2025 update.</p><p>Samsung rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-owners-are-finally-seeing-a-crucial-october-2025-patch">the patch for its newer foldables</a>, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7, earlier in October. The security update has also already made its way to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy S22 series. Although the month already came and went, the October 2025 security update is now becoming widely available for a variety of Samsung Galaxy models.</p><h2 id="how-to-check-if-the-october-2025-patch-is-available-2">How to check if the October 2025 patch is available</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-update-01" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can check for an update on your Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Galaxy Z Fold 6 by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and tapping the <strong>Software update</strong> tab.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> was a turning point for the Chinese manufacturer. Although OnePlus made phones for a decade, there was always a sense that its camera prowess wasn't up to scratch — at least against its Chinese rivals and Google.</p><p>That narrative changed with the OnePlus 13, with the device able to deliver standout cameras with the same versatility as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200</a> and other phones in this category. I'm still a little miffed that we didn't get a Pro version (much less an Ultra model), but it's a good thing that OnePlus focused on a single device, and it isn't like the OnePlus 13 misses out on much.</p><p>I started using the phone in December 2024, and tested it extensively at launch. While I didn't review the device this time, I used it quite a bit throughout the course of 2025, switching to it intermittently. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> now available in China and a global launch on November 13, it's time to take a look at how the OnePlus 13 holds up nearly a year after its debut; to see where it still has an edge, and where it doesn't quite manage to measure up any longer.</p><h2 id="one-of-the-best-designs-of-2025-2">One of the best designs of 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FarUerJUmM77QqYYh4CZkF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FarUerJUmM77QqYYh4CZkF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5480" height="3087" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of the design when I saw the renders of the OnePlus 13. I've always liked the designs of OnePlus phones in the past, and I felt that the manufacturer was veering away from its design ethos in an effort to stand out.</p><p>Thankfully, it turned out to be a non-issue; the OnePlus 13 still feels good in-hand, and even though it has a flat design, the subtle bevels ensure the sides don't dig into your palm. The weight balance is ideal, and the unique leather back continues to be one of my favorite features on the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7ern7Xrw6ueNeboASKfdXF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ern7Xrw6ueNeboASKfdXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leather is softer and has a better texture than regular leather-backed phones, and after nearly a year of use, it continues to look great — the blue model is still my recommendation. I didn't see any issues with the build quality even with a dozen or so tumbles, and the fact that the rear panel has leather instead of glass also makes a difference in this area.</p><p>What's notable is that the custom glass layer at the front did an admirable job. I don't use a case with my phones, so it's good to see the device come away unscathed after long-term use. Similarly, I had no problems using it outdoors during India's monsoon season, with IP68 and IP69 water resistance clearly up to the task.</p><h2 id="hardware-with-plenty-of-power-left-2">Hardware with plenty of power left</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fCpyaspGuBLc2XyCAMjmGF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCpyaspGuBLc2XyCAMjmGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 6.82-inch AMOLED panel continues to be one of the best around; it has excellent colors, good brightness levels, and doesn't have any issues with HDR content. There really isn't much to talk about here other than to say that the green line issue that plagued devices in the past just wasn't a problem.</p><p>Honestly, I can say the same about the hardware. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is an absolute powerhouse, and I still feel that it isn't being used to its full potential — you just don't have that caliber of games on Android. We've seen manufacturers go to great lengths in recent years to tout lag-free use after several years, and to me, that makes the biggest difference with these kinds of phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EVpZ6onLVvctoNpb7QhLFF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVpZ6onLVvctoNpb7QhLFF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, any phone is undoubtedly fast when you start using it (unless you have Samsung's A series devices), but the real test is after a year or two, when things inevitably start slowing down. Thankfully, this isn't an issue on the OnePlus 13, and the phone feels just as fluid as the day I set it up. OnePlus says the phone will be fast even after four years of use, and I don't doubt those claims — I recently booted up the OnePlus 8T to test it out for a while, and it held up astonishingly well.</p><p>Battery life has been consistent too; I still get a day's worth out of the device, and there isn't any noticeable battery degradation. Of course, the use of silicon carbon battery tech means the OnePlus 13 should have better longevity than earlier models, and I'll be putting that to the test by reevaluating the phone next year. As it stands, the battery is just as reliable, and I like that I can easily charge the device with any USB PD charger at 50W.</p><h2 id="oxygenos-16-gives-a-much-needed-software-boost-2">OxygenOS 16 gives a much-needed software boost</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GXDXRsTEmwMphvayRnQGXF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXDXRsTEmwMphvayRnQGXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 launched with OxygenOS 15, and it just got the update to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>-based OxygenOS 16. The update introduces a brand-new UI with translucent effects, and it has better cohesion and increased fluidity. While I'm still not enthused about the UI looking so similar to iOS 26, I'll admit that it is better than OxygenOS 15.</p><p>The software update injects freshness and additional fluidity, and makes the device that much better.

The sunglasses have a sporty design and workout-inspired features, including better water-resistance and longer battery life. One of Vanguard's best features is software integration with Garmin, Strava, and Health Connect, and it's now rolling out other Meta smart glasses.</p><p>The company quietly added "Autocapture with Garmin" to the list of camera features supported by Meta HSTN and both generations of Ray-Ban Meta on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/compare/" target="_blank">website</a>. Users started seeing Garmin, Strava, and Health Connect integration available in the Meta AI app earlier this month, according to Reddit posts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OakleyMetaGlasses/comments/1oclfxn/update_your_meta_ai_app_hstn_now_has_garminstrava/" target="_blank">OakleyMetaGlasses</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1odp8r3/garmin_integration_has_come_to_gen_1_2_right_now/" target="_blank">RayBanMeta</a> subs.</p><p>Autocapture and other health integrations appear to be rolling out as a server-side change. The features aren't listed in the release notes for version 19.2 of Meta glasses software. Android Central spotted Garmin and Strava integrations using version 244.0.0.30.167 of the Meta AI app for Android, and version 19.2 on Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jU7jgSWtskdA35jouuCZzP" name="Meta-HSTN-Autocapture-Screenshots" alt="Garmin integration in the Meta AI app for Oakley Meta HSTN." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jU7jgSWtskdA35jouuCZzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, we had to create a new Meta AI account to see the Garmin and Strava app connection options. If you aren't seeing the features and your app and glasses are both up to date, consider trying a new account. This is another sign that Meta may be rolling out these integrations for older glasses gradually on a server-side basis.</p><p>When Garmin integration is available on your pair of Oakley Meta HSTN, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a>, or Ray Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses, you can connect them to a supported watch or cycling computer. To do so, you'll need to install the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/e9044ba2-20b0-40a4-9d8e-3e13193b6f5f" target="_blank">Meta AI app from the Connect IQ store</a> onto your Garmin device. The Meta AI app will walk you through the process of adding a Meta data field to your favorite workouts on a Garmin watch.</p><p>From there, Oakley Meta and Ray-Ban Meta users can start using Autocapture to record key moments during their workouts. The integration also lets your Meta glasses answer questions about your time, distance, pace, and other metrics in real time — based on Garmin data. Keep in mind you'll need to have your phone, Garmin device, and Meta glasses all with you to use these features.</p><h2 id="not-an-oakley-meta-vanguard-exclusive-2">Not an Oakley Meta Vanguard exclusive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Venu-X1" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch sitting on a wooden board together." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta touted Garmin and Strava integrations as critical Oakley Meta Vanguard features, but luckily they're also arriving on (almost) all of the brand's smart glasses. The only exception are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>, which don't support Autocapture with Garmin at the moment. Those glasses are heavier, making them less suited for workout use anyway.</p><p>It's especially nice to see features like 60FPS video recording and workout app connections make their way to older glasses, namely Oakley Meta HSTN and Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1. That way, buyers don't need to purchase Vanguard just for the Garmin integration.</p><p>If you want to see these features in action, check out Android Central's resident wearables expert Michael Hicks' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">in-depth test of Garmin integration on Vanguard</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This new template set is said to be "smarter" and more "helpful" to the user. Google's calling these new templates "trendy" with automation and "smart media selection," capable of deciding the best shots from your camera roll that you should use.</p><p>Users can also get a little more creative with music and text.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128862?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&#zippy=%2Cstart-with-a-template">support document</a> for the feature, Google explains how to create a "Highlight Video," which can leverage these templates. Users must first navigate to <strong>Google Photos > Create > Highlight Video </strong>to get going. Once there, Google says you'll find a selection of templates, which are all "pre-made videos" that already feature music, text, and beat-matching. Once the template you want is selected, users can manually pick their photos, or let Google's automation do the work for them through "Help me select."</p><p>The manual side involves using Photos' Search, and typing in names, dates, and places.</p><p>The reviewing/editing process is where some more user creativity can come into play. Users can tap the music note icon to swap the tunes, reorder their clips, or remove them. The publication states that the new templates haven't appeared widely just yet, but that shouldn't take long to change.</p><h2 id="a-template-for-highlights-2">A template for highlights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GuQu3rSySDYsEc52wikEKm" name="google-photos-create-launch-hero" alt="Google Photos is rolling a new "Create" button, letting users turn their memories into unique remixes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GuQu3rSySDYsEc52wikEKm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8733" height="4912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-10-year-celebration-updates">celebrated its 10th birthday</a> earlier this summer, and it looks like the company behind it isn't slowing down the new features. In September, the Photos app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">incorporated Veo 3's</a> image-to-video generation technology. This gave users the ability to create short, six-second clips with incredibly high-quality, using their own imagery. The Create tab is where this all takes place, giving access to more tools, alongside the Veo 3 model.</p><p>Also, the idea of hopping on trends and templates is quite familiar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">following YouTube's update</a>. Shorts gained a new feature, which gave short-form content creators a "template" button when watching other videos. In Remix, users will find a "use this template" icon that brings that trending music or sound clip into their dashboard, so they can put their own spin on things.</p><p>YouTube said it was preparing an expansion to its template feature, enabling users to grab multiple clips for videos.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung appears to be lining up its next flagship launch for February 25, 2026.</p><p>That’s a switch from its usual late-January or early-February window. According to Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mt.co.kr/tech/2025/11/02/2025103113281189654" target="_blank">Money Today</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1984803640192999894" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve</a>), Samsung is prepping the Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco, and the choice of location is just as telling as the date.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly heading back to San Francisco for the first time since the Galaxy S23 launch due to its status as a hub for artificial intelligence, and Samsung apparently plans to make a massive statement. The company is positioning the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series as the definitive AI smartphone and showcasing its entire new AI strategy from the heart of the tech world.</p><p>The shift in timing seems to be linked to tweaks in the lineup. Samsung was apparently mulling changes such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead">introducing a Pro variant or an Edge version in place of the traditional Plus model</a>, but now leaks suggest the company is planning to retain the familiar trio: base, Plus, and Ultra.</p><p>That said, earlier rumors had pointed to a possible postponement to March 2026, so the February date, while plausible, isn’t officially confirmed. Additionally, this new date feels like a return to an older schedule, one we haven't seen since the Galaxy S9 way back in 2018.</p><h2 id="ai-is-the-headliner-2">AI is the headliner</h2><p>Beyond dates and names, the Galaxy S26 series is shaping up to lean heavily into AI, new silicon, and upgraded camera hardware. Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/sec/sec.php?c=sec&y=3154" target="_blank">executive remarks</a> flagged “user-centric next-gen AI,” a “second-generation custom AP,” and stronger performance with “new camera sensors.”</p><p>In particular, the custom AP clue suggests that Samsung’s in-house Exynos 2600 chip will power some models.</p><p>Design leaks also hint at some tangible changes. The Ultra model may have a more pronounced pill-shaped camera bump, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">support for the next-gen Qi2 wireless charging standard</a> (thanks to a built-in magnetic ring), and possibly the continuation of the triple-lens stack.</p><p>Of course, leaks are leaks — nothing official yet. But if it all holds up, the S26 series could mark Samsung’s clearest statement yet about where its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship phones</a> are headed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A good headset is a must-have, and is usually one of the first things that goes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tech-summer-travel-with-toddlers">my travel bag</a>. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing's Headphone 1</a> in the past (mostly due to the looks and sound quality), but I upgraded to Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 in the last month, and it has been outstanding.</p><p>I used the earlier model, the QuietComfort Ultra, for quite a while now, and I like the design and customizable sound along with terrific noise isolation. The QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 doesn't change things too much; it looks the same and has the same great sound. Essentially, it's an iterative update that addresses two issues: audio over USB-C and battery life. The QC Ultra Gen 2 lasts up to 30 hours on a charge, six hours more than its predecessor.</p><p>The increase in battery life makes all the difference in regular use, and why I went with the QC Ultra Gen 2 over other headsets I have on hand. Notably, I found it to be better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> for my own use; it is a smidgen lighter at 250g, but it fits much better on my head, and I found it to be extremely comfortable on long-haul intercontinental flights. The headband has a good range of adjustability, and it distributes the weight of the headset evenly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GnWgG4bHV2bXATQ5JfbtrF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnWgG4bHV2bXATQ5JfbtrF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another plus point is that it doesn't take up as much room; it folds down flat (just like the Sony), but the carrying case isn't anywhere as large, and that makes the QC Ultra Gen 2 a little easier to slot into my admittedly-crowded tech bag. The clamping force isn't as high, and the comfortable fit and plush ear pads have a huge impact on a 20-hour flight. I had the headset on the entire time while traveling to the U.S. from India, and most of the time, I didn't even notice it was there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nUh8bLmyg8LKw6QYSR2DxF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUh8bLmyg8LKw6QYSR2DxF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="q9Zxts6KJ529okyucUYRxF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9Zxts6KJ529okyucUYRxF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fvye96t5TxijVbyh8tTwvF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvye96t5TxijVbyh8tTwvF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BzydwpinVqJs6bZavFbVhF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BzydwpinVqJs6bZavFbVhF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="H6DSDjUv8CdpJZvsuBxcHF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6DSDjUv8CdpJZvsuBxcHF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>That brings me to the next part: noise isolation. Both Bose and Sony do a brilliant job in this area, and I found the QC Ultra Gen 2 to tune out the incessant whine of jet engines without any problems — it handles the low rumble of engines a little better than Sony. Honestly, if you're a frequent traveler, investing in a headset with good noise isolation is the best thing you can do, and the QC Ultra Gen 2 is among the best — if not the best overall — in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oGqvJWJtjRMx5NsgmypVpF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGqvJWJtjRMx5NsgmypVpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The angled design of the audio drivers means you get detailed sound, and Bose does a standout job with spatial audio, offering an expanded soundstage that's impressive. Again, this makes a difference on a long flight, and while Bose doesn't have extensive EQ options, I always found the brand's tuning to be preferable to my tastes — more so than the WH-100XM6. The bass in particular is vibrant and detailed, and it makes listening to most genres that much more enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8DrzmgSUKNkaJnnXqcAuhF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8DrzmgSUKNkaJnnXqcAuhF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are other niceties, including the ability to get lossless audio over USB-C. This isn't something that I care about while traveling, but it is quite handy while I'm home, and it was fun connecting the headset to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">listening via Roon</a>.

The WH-1000XM6 still has the overall edge, but I didn't have any issues getting the QC Ultra Gen 2 to last close to 30 hours. Thankfully, fast charging is intact, so a 15-minute charge gives you an additional two hours of music playback, and that definitely comes in handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MEe6AQCpuG2EmX2jJCxqLF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEe6AQCpuG2EmX2jJCxqLF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comfort plays a big role when choosing a travel headset, and the QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 gets everything right in this area — and that's why I use it over the WH-1000XM6.

By jumping directly to the refined N2P node, Qualcomm is bypassing the first-gen N2 process entirely.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HAfhPt9VfcTyHugnxSyEnN" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Agentic-AI-lifestyle" alt="Agentic AI lifestyle example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HAfhPt9VfcTyHugnxSyEnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2572" height="1447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The N2P process represents TSMC’s second-generation 2nm technology, and it’s already looking impressive on paper. Compared to the N3E node (used for the 3nm-based Snapdragon 8 Elite), N2P promises up to 18% better performance or 36% lower power consumption.</p><p>It also packs around 1.15x the chip density of the current 3nm N3E process, allowing for more transistors in the same space. Simply put, this is the kind of tech shift that could redefine what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> can do over the next few years.</p><h2 id="a-full-platform-overhaul-2">A full platform overhaul</h2><p>Qualcomm is also planning to add support for LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage in the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6. These upgrades should make phones faster and more efficient.</p><p>The new memory and storage standards are also designed with AI-driven tasks in mind, so they may come in handy for the increasingly machine-learning-heavy world of Android software and camera systems.</p><p>Now for the bad news. This cutting-edge technology is expensive. DCS says the cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 chip itself is expected to increase greatly. That cost won't be eaten by the manufacturers. It will be passed directly to you.</p><p>So, while the next generation of elite smartphones is poised to be incredibly powerful, those eye-watering prices are only going to get higher.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Many people use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> made by companies like Samsung, and those include a built-in solution from the company that made your particular watch. Yes, it will make things like syncing alarms between a Google Pixel device and another device difficult, but you're not going to lose anything.</p><h2 id="why-it-s-happening-is-more-interesting-2">Why it's happening is more interesting</h2><p>Chances are, you only care about this if you use one Pixel device and one Galaxy device; this is more common than you might realize. Even then, you know you'll still be able to have alarms, timers, stopwatches, and all the other things a clock app should do on both devices, even if the apps come from two different places. Like I said, it's not that big of a deal.</p><p>Why it's happening might be, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-custom-Tile" alt="A custom "Morning" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing alarm and reminder info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A while ago, I wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/androids-biggest-feature-is-also-its-biggest-flaw">Android's biggest strength</a> - being available and open to manufacturer customizations - was also its biggest weakness. Dropping support for the clock app is very likely a cost-saving initiative by Google; not having to test and support an app for devices it doesn't control saves both time and resources. It will save money while shifting more responsibility to the companies making the products - now Samsung has to make sure everything is perfect in the clock app for Galaxy devices, for example.</p><p>Google will never be able to get away with scaling back what little bit of "openness" Android offers. The only alternative is to act more like a hardware maker. It's also not the first time we've seen this sort of move from Google. The phone dialer is an excellent example, and if you really want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-now-use-ai-to-detect-scam-calls-in-real-time">kill as many spam calls as you can</a>, you need to use Google's phone app. Google doesn't offer the "smart" spam detection to anyone as a standalone API. Of course, other AI tricks and tools are also at play here, with every phone seemingly having something different, depending on who makes it.</p><p>It's also something I think we need to get used to reading about, especially with Samsung's offerings. Plain and simple: if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">modern Galaxy phone</a>, you do not need apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-me-crazy-i-prefer-ios-google-chrome-app-androids">Google Chrome</a>, a Google Address book, or even the Gmail app. You might want them and find them useful, but every function they offer is replicated in Samsung's own apps. Google could (it won't) drop "third-party" support for non-Pixel devices from these apps tomorrow, and other than bad press, nothing would really change.</p><p>The one issue is cross-device and cross-platform synchronization. Google will never remove the Gmail app (for example) from phones that aren't a Pixel because it wants people to use Gmail. Allowing us to have one account synchronized across every device with a screen is useful enough that we're going to keep using a dedicated and simple-to-set-up Gmail app, which happens to tie in well with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-google-sell-your-data">Google's business of getting eyeballs</a> on the web. Not every app is that way, though.</p><p>Samsung's address book leverages the feature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/2753077?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid" target="_blank">using Google's cloud to sync</a> everything without using Google's People app. Google doesn't really monetize its address book (I pray they never do), so it could drop app support for it without any serious issues. Most of Google's small, basic apps are this way, and if you have a Google account, you can sync things like addresses and phone numbers on any app from any phone maker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bdEDEjJJGzFq9iSnqoSg5k" name="google-contacts-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Contacts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdEDEjJJGzFq9iSnqoSg5k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What concerns me are apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. Right now, it's in Google's best interests to support Google Photos on every smartphone and modern web browser. The app is l<em>ightly</em> monetized and can act as a gateway to buying photo prints, but the real draw for Google is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-was-quietly-collecting-your-messages-and-phone-app-data">analytics it harvests</a>, knowing who is using what, where they are using it, how often they use it, etc. Everyone wants a tighter leash on this sort of thing in the name of privacy, but if that happens, is it really worth the time and money to keep the app for iOS or even Galaxy phones around?</p><p>We know the answer: it's not. Google isn't here to make your day brighter or your life easier; it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" target="_blank">here to make money</a>. Take that ability away, and the company will shift focus onto the next money-maker.</p><p>This had to happen eventually, and it will keep happening. Google can not (<strong>and should not)</strong> act as some overlord and assume full control over all software on licensed Android devices, so apps like Samsung's Galaxy Clock are never going away.</p><p>We don't <strong>want</strong> them to go away, even if we never use them. What we should always want is choice, and seeing our choices slowly whittled down, especially with the advent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">all things AI</a>, the next big idea might never happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After the phone comes completely into view, you can make out what appears to be bumpers on both the top and bottom of the left side (right-side if the screen was facing you.)</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DsXvxziXnVmDPCMLS5t7zW" name="ayaneo-phone-teaser-render" alt="AYANEO Phone teaser render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsXvxziXnVmDPCMLS5t7zW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's really not much else to go off of here, besides the inclusion of the triggers and the dual-camera setup. However, after tossing a screenshot from the YouTube video into Photoshop and cranking up the brightness, we can get a better look at the design. Needless to say, it's probably a good thing that AYANEO isn't trying to go for style points here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTkBrjsfMVNZVqAjXAB4rQ" name="ayaneo-phone-youtube-render-brightness" alt="AYANEO Phone with brightness adjusted to reveal design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTkBrjsfMVNZVqAjXAB4rQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Technically, this isn't the first time that we've heard about AYANEO getting into the smartphone business. Earlier this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ayaneo-might-bring-back-one-of-the-most-unique-phone-designs-and-im-here-for-it">AYANEO Phone was teased</a> during a livestream where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">AYANEO Pocket DS</a> and KONKR Pocket FIT were introduced. However, that was back in August, and we haven't seen or heard any rumblings about it since then.</p><p>Once released, it will provide an alternative to a segment of the market that is largely dominated by the likes of RedMagic and ASUS. Of those, only RedMagic is easily accessible here in the U.S., as the company's latest phones usually arrive on Amazon shortly after they are released. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS' ROG Phone</a> lineup is only readily available in select markets, leaving those in the States to rely on importing or picking one up from the second-hand market.</p><p>It's too early to tell which category the AYANEO Phone will fall into, as the U.S. market is notoriously difficult to penetrate, especially for newcomers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states, if you have a Pixel Watch, you won't be affected by this new decision. However, if you have "any other Wear OS" watch, you will see this change.

Data in Google Sheets can become a bit much, but Gemini's updates arriving for October aim to improve its format and ensure the app's analytical capabilities are up to par. Google states Sheets can now understand complex and multi-step instructions from users.</p><p>As an example, the post highlights Sheets' ability to "delete all archived rows, apply conditional formatting, and add a 'Notes' column" all in a single prompt. Moreover, Gemini advances with "web grounding." Users can now ask the AI to conduct some research on the internet.</p><p>The AI can input the information you deserve into your spreadsheet automatically, as well as opening its abilities to more languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, French, Italian, and German.</p><p>Business security is always an object of discussion, so new AI defenses are rolling in for October. Google says it's bringing in ransomware protections for Drive users on desktop. This runs in real-time, and if the system is triggered, Google says users will have their file sync halted. There will also be a visible notification on your computer, informing you of what's happened, so you can take immediate action.</p><p>The post adds that users can restore any corrupted files "in bulk" to a version where the ransomware did not exist.</p><h2 id="ai-protections-hit-gmail-2">AI protections hit Gmail</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gmail's also getting in on the AI defenses, as Google rolls out E2EE (end-to-end encrypted) protections. Now, users in Workspace can send "encrypted and confidential" emails to whomever they need to, even if they "use a different email provider or work outside your organization."</p><p>Wrapping up the huge October drop are thread summaries for users in Google Chat, as well as "refine me," which corrects any grammar mistakes and more before sending. Speech translation in Meet grab an expansion, bringing in English to German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.</p><p>Google highlights its video generation update for Flow and the Gemini app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">which brought Veo 3.1</a> to users. Over the base v3 model, Veo 3.1 is said to give users more creative agency with their generated video clips. Additionally, this updated model enhances its sound capabilities, gives users better narrative control, and even touts better "realism" for generated textures.</p><p>The Veo 3.1 model is available in Google Vids, Flow, and the Gemini app.</p><p>October's drop sort of piggybacks off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-huge-august-workspace-update-caught-up-faster-vids-gen-ai">the one from August</a>.
