Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google’s Gemini app can now handle audio uploads on Android, iOS, and web, a feature users have been asking for the most.</li><li>Supported formats include MP3, M4A, and WAV, with the app transcribing audio, summarizing key points, and extracting actionable insights.</li><li>Users can upload up to 10 audio files at once, but their total length can’t exceed 10 minutes, and other Gemini usage limits still apply.</li></ul><p>Last month, signs popped up that Google was working on letting the Gemini app handle audio uploads. This much-requested feature is now live across Android, iOS, and the web.</p><p>The update supports MP3, M4A, and WAV files. Once you upload, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will transcribe the audio, pull out the key points, and give you a clear summary (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/gemini-audio-upload/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This feature can be accessed via the plus menu on Gemini’s mobile app or “Upload files” on the web. Once you upload an audio clip, the app analyzes it, turning meetings, interviews, lectures, or voice notes into easy-to-digest summaries and key takeaways.</p><h2 id="top-user-request-comes-to-life-2">Top user request comes to life</h2><p>Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1965057589718499756?s=19" target="_blank">shared on X</a> that this has been the feature users have asked for the most.</p><p>However, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14903178" target="_blank">support page</a>, you can upload up to 10 audio files at once, but their combined length can’t exceed 10 minutes. Other Gemini usage limits still apply, so keep that in mind before sending a batch of files.</p><p>The audio upload limits aren’t infinite but are fairly generous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-likely-to-get-video-analysis-feature-via-google-search-app">compared to video</a>. Free users get 10 minutes for audio, which is double the five-minute video cap. Meanwhile, paid users get three times the one-hour video limit.</p><p>Another limit to keep in mind is the file count. You can upload up to 10 files per prompt, and this covers everything from code folders with up to 5,000 files to GitHub repos and ZIPs with up to 10 compressed files. The new audio feature counts toward this 10-file total, so it doesn’t expand the overall limit.</p><p>Beyond transcription, Gemini can highlight key points, distinguish speakers, and pull out action items or quotes. This, in turn, makes any audio file a neatly structured, searchable document.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company introduced many new features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, Magic Cue, and more, but one of the most interesting additions was the Daily Hub. However, it looks like Google has temporarily pulled the feature from the Pixel 10.</p><p>Google issued a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/pixel-10-daily-hub-pause/">9to5Google</a> saying that to ensure the best possible experience, it is "temporarily pausing" the public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-enable-and-use-daily-hub">preview of Daily Hub</a> for users. The company added it is "actively working to enhance performance and refine the personalized experience," and will "reintroduce an improved Daily Hub when it's ready."</p><h2 id="daily-hub-temporarily-pulled-for-improvements-2">Daily Hub temporarily pulled for improvements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X" name="Google-Pixel-10-daily-hub" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those unaware, Google introduced the Daily Hub with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> as a personal digest for users. It works like a hub where users can see their daily events, weather information, reminders, and even things like bills from Gmail. For some users, the Daily Hub even pulled up some relevant notes from Google Keep.</p><p>In addition to this, Google also includes media recommendations from apps you've opted into (with information pulled from Google TV), as well as suggestions from YouTube and YouTube Music. The Daily Hub essentially acts like a digital newspaper that updates in real time and surfaces content relevant to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, while promising in theory, the feature has been hit or miss. The Daily Hub never appeared for me on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">my Pixel 10 Pro</a>, and for those it did, it didn't surface every day. It was supposed to show at the top of the Discover feed and in At a Glance on the homescreen.</p><p>Now Google has completely paused the feature. The company hasn't said when the Daily Hub will return on Pixel 10 phones, but we expect only a brief delay before its comeback. We'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more from the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This can include security enhancements, new features via Pixel Drops, OS upgrades, bug fixes, and more. The Watch 4 will officially be supported till at least October 2028.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-pixel-watch-4-is-smarter-slicker-and-more-powerful-2">The Pixel Watch 4 is smarter, slicker, and more powerful</h2><p>It's clear that Google wasn't aiming for any major redesign of any of its new launches since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a> looks nearly identical to the Watch 3. The bezels around the display are slimmer, which makes the screen look larger, and the slightly domed display pushes even closer against the outer glass, making the UI feel better to interact with. Wear OS 6 looks vibrant and fresh, and the new Material 3 Expressive design makes interactions fun.</p><p>The power bump is welcomed on the Pixel Watch 4 thanks to the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 SoC. You get on-device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> capabilities like smart replies to messages and a Raise-to-Talk feature. The Watch 4 is also the first commercially available smartwatch to have satellite SOS connectivity. The faster charging and significant battery boost are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/should-you-buy-the-google-pixel-watch-4">big reasons to upgrade</a> to the Pixel Watch 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U" name="Pixel-Watch-4-charging" alt="Pixel Watch on the side mounted charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, in Matte Black or Polished Silver. You can also get the 41mm variant in Champagne Gold and the 45mm in Satin Moonstone. Prices start at $349 or $449 for the Wi-Fi and LTE versions, respectively. The 45mm variant gets a $50 bump in price for the individual variants. If you've been holding off on upgrading your Pixel Watch 2, now would be a good time to trade it in for the Watch 4. It's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> to buy in 2025, and a great companion for your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ac4ab0b-8126-448d-abbe-166125a85d72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEompPFnaagkMfe5Jj2GmG.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Smarter time keeper</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is one of the most powerful Wear OS smartwatches available, thanks to a new chipset, on-device AI features, satellite SOS, and more.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It notes that Google has changed its old AI Mode (google.com/aimode) to a much simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=50&aep=11">google.com/ai</a> URL. There's nothing else different with this change. The main takeaway is the "shortcut" to get there has changed, presumably to help people remember and get there faster, as you're not forced to remember the name of the feature—just AI.</p><p>The publication speculates that this change could signal more to come from Google, as its URL is shortened simply to AI.</p><p>It makes sense; if Google has created a much broader AI link, which, for now, takes users to Search's AI Mode, more of its software could end up here as new tabs or overhead links. Elsewhere, the publication discovered that Google has shifted its AI Mode icon within its main app on Android and iOS.</p><p>Now, users won't find the colorful icon <em>in </em>the search box. Instead, it's placed beneath it, alongside the voice query button and the Lens icon. It's unclear why Google changed this, as the colorful AI Mode icon is still within the search box in new Chrome tabs on Android.</p><h2 id="opening-the-doors-for-more-ai-2">Opening the doors for more AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC" name="ai-mode-google-search-io2025" alt="AI Mode at I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1580" height="889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI Mode has had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">pretty productive year so far</a>, in terms of bringing new features to users interested in the software. During I/O, Google announced the "Deep Search" feature for AI Mode, which users should now see more frequently whenever AI Overviews appear during a query. The purpose of this is to allow the AI to give you a more "in-depth" response about a topic, helping you to understand those nitty-gritty details.</p><p>It's a feature that enables the AI to scour multiple websites and do all the heavy research for you, before delivering a "comprehensive" overview of everything to your benefit. At I/O, Google said AI Mode's Deep Search goes through "hundreds of websites" and uses its ability to draw conclusions and more to help you with harder topics and things you want to learn more about.</p><p>In July, Google updated AI Mode again, but that came with the ability for it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">to place phone calls for you</a>.

Aside from the Ear 3 name, the post on X said we should expect the product "soon." The company also delivered an up-close shot of the product's Ear 3 branding. We mentioned last time that it feels like we're "due" for another Nothing Ear release, as, in 2024, we had the Nothing Ear Open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">launch in September</a>.</p><p>This was a shift from the company's typical standard earbud products, as it deployed an Open earbud design that hooks around your ear.</p><p>The Nothing Ear, part of the brand's naming shift, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-ear-a-confirmation">launched in April 2024</a>. It seems these new Ear 3 buds will follow that design with silicone tips, a stabilizer stem, and more. It's unclear what major features the new pair will debut with. There's a chance the buds could play nice with its recent AI suite on its flagship Nothing Phone 3. Perhaps users can record voice notes using their buds and interact with their handheld even more just by touching the buds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update carries AYI1 at the end of its version number for September, bringing the current month's security fixes, but also two new features for pre-existing One UI 8 elements. As Vats notes, Samsung is bringing an update to its Now Bar that lets users view finance information from their lock screen.</p><p>The changelog states, "Check stock prices without unlocking. If there's a significant price change in a stock you've added to your watchlist in Google Finance, it will appear in the Now bar at the end of the trading day."</p><p>Additionally, the publication discovered the rest of the Korean patch notes, which hold another update for Samsung DeX. The September patch lets users "add widgets to the home screen in the Samsung DeX mode." The notes mention that users can add widgets like a calendar, clock, or "decorative" images. A user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1965030576962093374">X also spotted the change</a>, showcasing what it will look like once users receive it.</p><p>On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Samsung's security side</a>, both foldables are receiving a heavy dose of "High" level security fixes, as well as two critical software fixes. The critical fixes are something Google mentions in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-09-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> for September. One of the fixes for CVE-2025-48539 regards an Android System fix. The other, CVE-2025-27034, is a critical fix for a Qualcomm closed-source component vulnerability.</p><h2 id="foldables-in-the-news-2">Foldables in the news</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Vats states on X, this update is rolling out for users in South Korea as of today (Sep 8). Typically, updates like this begin on home soil for Samsung's devices before rolling out to other regions. We should slowly begin to notice this patch hit devices in more regions as the week progresses (and hopefully the U.S. by the end of the week).</p><p>Moreover, the user on X who spotted the DeX widgets states this feature is expected to hit other devices, like the Galaxy S25 series, and "older" models once Samsung drops the update.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> made some headlines last week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">due to its popularity</a> and how Samsung is scrambling because of it. It's been reported that Samsung is changing up its production plans for the Fold 7 in September, looking to produce 260,000 new units, instead of 200,000 like it originally planned. We can't say we're surprised, as reports from South Korea showed that the Fold 7 was incredibly popular during its pre-order phase, beating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The Flip model, in the past, was typically the one people leaned toward. However, this year, the Fold 7 took up 60% of the pre-orders.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The OnePlus 13 sports a 6.82-inch display and measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5–8.9 mm. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a slightly smaller 6.8-inch panel but with comparable dimensions of 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="54x2xzyPbEUy3MXqSeYCum" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/54x2xzyPbEUy3MXqSeYCum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you do feel in your hand, though, is the weight.

Starting with the former, you get a physical SIM card slot on the OnePlus 13, so you can just push your SIM in and start using the device. On the Pixel 10 Pro XL in the U.S., you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">only get an eSIM option</a>.</p><p>In terms of durability, technically, the OnePlus 13 is more durable than the Pixel 10 Pro XL thanks to its dual IP68 + IP69 rating, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL only carries IP68 dust and water resistance. Both phones can handle occasional rain and even short underwater video capture, but the OnePlus is also rated against high-pressure, high-temperature water jet sprays.

This includes periodic Pixel Drops and Android feature drops. The phone will continue to get updates until 2032.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-is-google-s-finest-foldable-yet-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google's finest foldable yet</h2><p>Just like the rest of the Pixel 10 series, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> might not look too different on the outside, but it has some pretty significant upgrades on the inside. One of the biggest in my book is the IP68 rating for dust and waterproofing. No other foldable has managed to achieve this level of rating yet, making the 10 Pro Fold the first to do it. The best we've had so far is an IP48 rating, which debuted with Samsung's foldables in 2024.</p><p>The other big change is the Tensor G5 chip, which unlocks more advanced on-device AI capabilities and performance. The latter is still not quite up to par with the competition, as we found out in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10 review</a>. The addition of magnets underneath the back panel of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold makes it the first foldable to natively support Qi2 wireless charging. Google calls this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, but it's essentially a way to use any MagSafe accessories directly with the 10 Pro Fold, without a case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is currently one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around. It comes in Moonstone and Jade trims, and you can pre-order it now, with open sales starting from October 9, 2025. The Fold still offers a physical SIM slot, unlike the rest of the series that have done away with it. Prices start at $1,799 for the base 16GB/256GB configuration, and the storage goes up to 1TB.</p><p>One impressive fact about the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that Google claims it can "handle over 10 years of folding." Google is confident about its new gearless hinge and the other durability improvements made to the folding display. The phone also has a sizeable battery which should easily let it last for more than a day on one charge. We'll be putting the 10 Pro Fold through our rigorous review process and will have the final verdict on whether it's worth it or not very soon.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ac4ab0b-8126-448d-abbe-166125a85d72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Folding like a champ</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the latest flagship from Google, sporting improved durability, an IP68 rating, Pixelsnap charging, and a more powerful Tensor chip than ever before.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="personal-trainers-aren-t-going-anywhere-yet-2">Personal trainers aren't going anywhere... yet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-2" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung debuted Running Coach alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">wearables expert Michael Hicks put it through its paces</a>. His experience was less-than-stellar, as Running Coach underestimated his abilities. That got me wondering whether a more amateur runner like myself would be a better fit for the software.</p><p>At Samsung's mobile devices booth at IFA 2025, I filled out a quick survey about my sleep and running habits, and was then given a slip with my running level and a QR code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6" name="Samsung-Running-Sleep-Test" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, I still ran into Running Coach limitations. The feature is built around fixed goals that are linked to your running level — I got Level 5 after the quick survey at IFA — with little room for personalization.</p><p>I think this strategy is a mistake, because it makes Running Coach too centered upon the goal of finishing a race length you may not be interested in. Additionally, when you reach a goal, you simply move to the next level without much focus on being able to complete those distances during training on a week-to-week basis.</p><p>For instance, the Level 5 training plan has me trying to finish a 10K under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile) — something I can already do. I can't tell Running Coach that I'm trying to cut my 5K time rather than build up to longer distances, or that I'd rather gain the strength to run five times per week before scaling distances. This seems like something that would be easy enough for Samsung to add with a few extra survey questions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-1" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll skip using Running Coach for my own training plan for now, but using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> on the Galaxy Watch 8 has actually been a big help.

It's a device that straps onto your waist and thighs, featuring a motor on each side for lifting your legs robotically. I admit I was skeptical, and it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but it's real, and it's called the Hypershell X Ultra.</p><p>The company explained that its goal is to enhance human capabilities. The $2,000 exoskeleton utilizes AI and machine learning to anticipate your next move and provide motorized assistance accordingly. It uses data from more than 12 sensors and its AI MotionEngine Ultra, built on training data, to adjust to your individual stride signature. No one walks the same way, and that's why AI and ML are necessary.</p><p>The device connects to an Android app and is designed for physical activities, like walking, hiking, and running.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT" name="Hypershell-X-Plus-App" alt="The Hypershell X Plus app running on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's something you really need to <em>feel</em> to believe, but the motorized exoskeleton actually does help lift your leg up in alignment with your stride to reduce exertion.

Not because the device doesn't work, but you still need to build cardiovascular endurance to run well.</p><p>Additionally, my short sprints with Hypershell revealed that the waistband slightly limited my mobility.

However, I <em>do</em> see runners potentially using exoskeletons for training. Fitness mode on the Hypershell X Ultra turns the motors<em> against</em> you, making it harder for you to run at your normal pace. It can also reduce impact stress while going downhill, possibly lessening knee and joint pain.</p><p>It might sound like torture, but advanced runners already do this with devices like speed parachutes. Personally, I find exoskeletons to be a more elegant solution for resistance training, and I'd definitely use a Hypershell in Fitness mode to intensify my training.</p><h2 id="ai-hardware-vs-software-2">AI hardware vs. software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iKJosySRY5cLpYmygL6MJW" name="Hypershell-X-Ultra-9" alt="A man wearing Hypershell X Ultra at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iKJosySRY5cLpYmygL6MJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI software tools are more accessible to runners than hardware exoskeletons, but I find the latter to be a more exciting training companion.

I'd never use it in a race, but I do think it can help you become a better runner.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Hypershell provided travel and lodging for part of my trip to IFA, but had no input in this article. </em></p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>The Pixel 10 is a noteworthy release for a few reasons, but while Google wants to claim its displays are the best on the market, it only achieves that goal by its own metrics. That's because, according to Sien Chang, product manager for Pixel Display, Google believes that most of its users are looking for a display that tops the charts for brightness and color accuracy.</p><p>It's a goal I surmised was at the root of the problems I started experiencing three years ago, after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a> was released. After months of increasingly painful headaches and eye pain, I learned the display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">was the root of the problem</a>.</p><p>Since then, I've learned a lot about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a> and spoken with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">companies like OnePlus</a> and Honor who are working towards making ultrabright modern displays more comfortable for people who are, effectively, allergic to them. It's a goal I had hoped Google would also adopt when the company launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting" target="_blank">new 'sensitive eyes'</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting"> feature</a> on the Pixel 10 Pro series, but it turns out the new feature simply doesn't do enough.</p><h2 id="still-stuck-in-the-mud-2">Still stuck in the mud</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LH7hNMzQZVe5siPT3E34FM" name="PWM-explainer" alt="Viewing default dimming rates using a 1/6400 shutter speed of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Honor 400 Pro, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LH7hNMzQZVe5siPT3E34FM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not long ago, Samsung debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">a new 480Hz PWM rate</a> on its phones, slightly exceeding that of the iPhone. This was followed by companies like OnePlus, Honor, Nothing, Xiaomi, and others that have launched phones with PWM rates in the thousands of hertz or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025" target="_blank">eliminated</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025"> PWM dimming altogether</a>.</p><p>So imagine my surprise when the Pixel 10 Pro launched with a feature that would "adjust the dimming rate for sensitive eyes" like mine. I hoped that Google would join the ranks of the aforementioned companies and show Samsung and Apple a new way forward for display excellence, but my hope was misplaced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WavtphM5v4m2shnJHQcvWL" name="google-pixel-10-pro-sensitive-eyes-accessibility-feature" alt="Testing out the new sensitive eyes dimming feature on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WavtphM5v4m2shnJHQcvWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I asked Google's display team why the company used 240Hz dimming for so long, only to settle on 480Hz for this new accessibility feature. After all, this is just catching up to the competition, not getting ahead. The response was, unfortunately, exactly what I expected.</p><p>"We always aim to deliver the best overall display experience of our users," Chang told me. "To us, this means delivering the best image quality that is comfortable to view in any condition. The EM (PWM) frequency, along with other specs, are driven by this comprehensive goal and therefore is not determined by any single factor."</p><p>Essentially, this means that Google's reason for choosing any specific display spec was entirely reliant on its goal of achieving "display excellence," as the company refers to it. In a way, it's similar to what we saw happen on the Nothing Phone 3 when the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-confirms-phone-3-pwm-rate-priortizes-picture-quality">lowered its PWM rate after launch</a> to "prioritize screen quality."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DZJGVmVcRmmnVdXv4PBZCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-0205" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZJGVmVcRmmnVdXv4PBZCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I respect the desire to top the charts and differentiate your product from a benchmark-worthy perspective, it doesn't make sense here. Google regularly discourages the use of benchmarks when assessing its Tensor processor performance. Why does the company care so much about display benchmarks? Shouldn't it focus on something that's better for the overall user experience?</p><p>Additionally, developing an accessibility setting should be based <em>on the disability</em> rather than following the same logic that led to Google's displays to this point. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">Several studies</a> on flicker show that Google should use <em>at least 3000Hz</em> PWM dimming based on brightness level and modulation rate. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/">the IEEE standards for flicker</a>, established back in 2008, prove this point.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VLWf4HsQuezz6okUWhEFKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-honor-magic-7-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLWf4HsQuezz6okUWhEFKU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Chang told me the Pixel team "investigated a solution for flicker-sensitive users and determined that enabling this new feature to adjust the EM frequency to 480 Hz would deliver an improvement for most people."

It's defined by comfort, with any other metrics and wins as secondary. If I can't use a display, I don't care about other specs; they're simply a nonstarter if I get a headache the moment I look at it.</p><p>No normal customer is going to look at any modern smartphone and see an image quality difference. It simply isn't reality, and the silly metrics these companies chase with their displays aren't just unrealistic, they're legitimately painful for those of us who can't look at them.</p><p>This is where the Pixel display team — in addition to both Samsung and Apple's display teams — seems to fully misunderstand the goal at hand. Sure, making it to the top of the charts at DXOMARK is cute, but it ultimately amounts to nothing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/alleged-galaxy-s26-dummy-units-edge-might-look-like-apple-leak">renders that leaked recently</a>, its back is dominated by a camera island that spans nearly the phone’s entire width.</p><p>The design looks strikingly similar to what’s been leaked for Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, suggesting Samsung might be borrowing some cues.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Ultra stay in the comfort zone, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/a-first-look-at-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-suggests-samsung-is-playing-it-safe/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>. The leak shows that they stick to a vertical triple-camera setup, but now it’s on a more compact island.</p><h2 id="thinner-across-the-board-2">Thinner across the board</h2><p>Samsung seems to be slimming down its next flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>. The S26 Edge drops from 5.8 mm to about 5.5 mm; the Pro goes from 7.2 to 6.7 mm; the Ultra trims to 7.8 mm from 8.2 mm. If anything, these numbers are flirting with featherweight territory.</p><p>On the hardware front, the Pro model is shaping up with a clear set of specs. It's reportedly configured with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. For photography, it leans on a triple-camera array: a 50 MP main sensor, joined by a 12 MP ultrawide and a 10 MP telephoto lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-render" alt="Galaxy S26 Pro CAD render  showing the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Power will likely come from a 4,300mAh battery, supporting 45W wired charging and Qi2 wireless with integrated magnets. Under the hood, it will presumably run on either Samsung's own Exynos 2600 or the next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><h2 id="ultra-is-the-absolute-powerhouse-2">Ultra is the absolute powerhouse</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to ship with a 6.9-inch display using Samsung’s latest third-gen anti-reflective glass. Configurations could go up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p><p>The rear setup is expected to include four cameras: a 200MP main, a 50MP periscope with a wider aperture than the S25 Ultra, a 50MP ultrawide, and an upgraded 12MP short-range telephoto. Reported dimensions come in at 163.4 x 77.9 x 7.8 mm.</p><p>The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultras-updated-design-could-make-it-the-most-comfortable-yet">expected to shift away from the sharp, boxy look</a> of earlier models, adopting a rounder, more curved design similar to the S25 Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="dBjTLfwvBKNyqiPbVXtDEP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Ultra-render" alt="Galaxy S26 Ultra render showing the back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBjTLfwvBKNyqiPbVXtDEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This leak doesn’t show fresh images of the Galaxy S26 Edge but does lay out its rumored specs. The phone is said to measure just 5.5mm thick and pack a 6.7-inch QHD+ display running at 120Hz. It may offer up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, along with a 200MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 4,300mAh battery.</p><p>All three models seem to feature Qi2 magnetic charging, meaning better alignment and possible accessory perks, like magnetic cases or snap-on batteries.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> introduced a new design language with much better build quality, and it addressed long-standing hardware issues. That said, the underwhelming nature of the Tensor G4 meant the 9 Pro XL wasn't quite up to scratch.</p><p>Thankfully, that's changing with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone retains a similar design as last year, and that's a good thing. Although it makes it look unquestionably like an iPhone, the build quality is fantastic, and it has a good presence — particularly in the Moonstone variant I'm using. The dull blue luster accentuates the design quite well, and the in-hand feel is pretty good thanks to the matte texture.</p><h2 id="a-design-that-s-unquestionably-google-2">A design that's unquestionably Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The camera bar at the back gives Google's phones a distinctive look, and it looks great while ensuring there's no wobble when using the phone on a table. If anything, the only quibble I have with the design is that the 10 Pro XL is quite heavy; at 232g, it is 11g heavier than its predecessor and 14g heavier than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I don't really get the reason for its bulk.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MHpgYkxCYMXUmqgCuphw9A" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHpgYkxCYMXUmqgCuphw9A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SjJNb4uGp5kKVksKTS298A" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SjJNb4uGp5kKVksKTS298A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3sKJKtUdzDjYiJHWHGpQv9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sKJKtUdzDjYiJHWHGpQv9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4976" height="2803" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rZw87erreH4sspcw7rtvr9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rZw87erreH4sspcw7rtvr9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4976" height="2803" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When you add a case (I'm using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/bellroys-pixel-10-leather-cases-are-absolutely-gorgeous">Bellroy's excellent leather case</a> (and we've rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-cases">best Pixel 10 Pro XL cases</a>)), you're looking at a weight of over 260g, and that's considerable.

Google somehow managed to ace this category, and the 10 Pro XL has fantastic color vibrancy and brightness levels. There are no issues with the ambient light sensor (something that plagued previous Pixels I used), and it does a good job maintaining 120Hz refresh.</p><p>There's good news on the hardware side of things as well, with Google switching to TSMC's 3nm node this time. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> brings much-needed upgrades, and it is noticeably faster than its predecessors. Google is using the same Cortex X4 core to do the heavy lifting this time around, but the increased 3.78GHz clock means it doesn't need to be active for as long.</p><p>The switch to Imagination Technologies' PowerVR DXT-48 means the Pixel 10 Pro XL isn't hobbled at gaming. It does a much better job in this regard, and while it still tends to throttle earlier than other phones, it isn't anywhere as extreme as previous Pixels. That alone is a huge deal, and it makes using the 10 Pro XL that much better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="yuHwjvLiV2r9Q26vMpGgDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuHwjvLiV2r9Q26vMpGgDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5066" height="2854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't get me wrong; the Tensor G5 still lags behind what Qualcomm and MediaTek have to offer, but it doesn't feel as limiting as previous generations. The 10 Pro XL manages thermals better, and it doesn't have any of the overheating issues that plagued earlier models.</p><p>The Tensor G5 also has much better efficiency, and while the Pixel 10 Pro XL doesn't last as long as its Chinese rivals, it goes a day without breaking a sweat. I'm still annoyed that Google continues to limit its charging protocol to 45W — it's time the brand started leveraging the 100W standard available with USB PD 3.0.</p><p>On the subject of charging, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has the distinction of being the only Android phone to have Qi 2 integration natively; the phone has the requisite magnets built in, and it's a good move by Google. It's exciting to be able to use Qi 2 accessories without needing a case, and the 10 Pro XL manages to hit 25W over the Qi 2 standard with relative ease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7CdkRkJNRuETWFDy5NXYv9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CdkRkJNRuETWFDy5NXYv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's a small thing, it's good to see Google finally switch to 256GB of storage in the base model of the 10 Pro XL. That's the variant I'm using, and after three weeks of use, I have 112GB of storage left on the device. I have no doubt that I'll fill up the storage on the phone in a matter of months, and Google annoyingly doesn't sell the 512GB or 1TB variants of the device in India, limiting the phone's potential.</p><p>The brand instead points to the 2TB Google One storage tier that's bundled with the phone (all Pixel 10 Pro XL buyers get a year of Google AI Pro) as an alternative, but that doesn't get away from the fact that you'll need to pay over $200 from the second year just to store your data.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-stand-out-2">Cameras that stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4879px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4879" height="2748" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixels always delivered great cameras, and that's no different this year.

The phone runs Android 16 out of the box, and it will get seven Android OS updates. Google's reliance on AI utilities give its devices a distinct advantage; while every other manufacturer is leveraging AI in some way, Google has meaningful features I actually end up using.</p><p>Take Magic Cue; the feature automatically suggests contextual information, and it's quite useful. It's limited to Google's own services at the moment, but it did a good job pulling up my order information from Gmail when I was talking to Dyson's customer care, and share my flight details as I was messaging.</p><p>The interface as a whole has better fluidity than previous generations, and the quirky design combined with unique extras gives it a vibrancy that you just don't get with any other phone.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-pixel-you-need-2">This is the Pixel you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="B2b8c2gbV6urytdPe4fWHA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2b8c2gbV6urytdPe4fWHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I enjoyed using the Pixel 10 Pro XL quite a bit, and I don't see myself switching to another device anytime soon.

You might want to hold off on that decision, as Meta's annual product conference will kick off on September 17, and we're expecting the company to unveil new smart glasses.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> have been one of Meta's most successful products to date, garnering tons of attention worldwide and selling millions of units. You may not be aware that these glasses are actually second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses, as the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> weren't nearly as popular.</p><p>Part of the success was greatly improved hardware between the first and second generation, while the other part has been the excitement of Meta AI being built into Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</p><p>Since we're anticipating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)</a> to be announced at Meta Connect 2025, my recommendation is to wait and see what Meta will unveil and how much better they might be over Ray-Ban's current offerings. For now, let's go over the potential differences based on what we know to help you make a decision now.</p><h2 id="the-upgrades-we-could-get-with-the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-2">The upgrades we could get with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-inspecting-01" alt="Inspecting the inside of transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses before putting them on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) are expected to come in two main varieties: sunglasses and prescription glasses. The currently available Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are offered in three different traditional Ray-Ban styles, each with a selection of colors and lens types. However, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again" target="_blank">is unable to offer all types of prescriptions</a> due to the frame styles.</p><p>Separating prescription and sunglasses styles would likely allow these prescription glasses users to utilize the new generation of smart glasses. If you've already taken a look at the available prescription options for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and can't get what you need, you should definitely wait and see what's available with the new rumored style options.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.83%;"><img id="jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="882" height="854" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Folks who are looking to primarily take photos or videos with their smart glasses should also wait to see what upgrades Meta will deliver with the camera on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3). The recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> smart glasses offer a notable camera upgrade for folks recording active video. If you plan to take your smart glasses out for a run, hike, or even while playing sports, waiting for a potential camera upgrade is a good option.</p><p>That's because the higher-resolution camera allows Meta to offer better image stabilization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">keeping the video jitter-free and bump-free</a>, almost no matter what you do. We don't expect any other camera upgrades over what Meta just delivered with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, though, but Meta could always surprise us with AI super resolution or something.</p><h2 id="meta-ai-but-better-2">Meta AI, but better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.53%;"><img id="yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1038" height="867" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of Meta AI, we're expecting a big upgrade for Meta AI on all of the company's upcoming smart glasses. That should include Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), as it's likely the company will include a new chipset that's able to do even more than the two-year-old chipset in the current Ray-Ban Meta product.</p><p>This upgraded Meta AI is said to be able to provide longer interaction sessions, including additional live AI time with recording storage. Meta AI will be able to pull up data from your personal recordings on request, helping you remember where you left your car keys, the coffee mug, or even someone's name whom you previously addressed.</p><p>Google's upcoming Android XR-powered smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">are also able to perform these functions</a>, and we fully expect any competing Meta smart glasses to be able to do it, too.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-price-2">What about the price?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-case-and-meta-ai-app-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses next to the glasses charging case and the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, any upgrade discussion isn't complete without a price. While there are currently no rumors regarding the price of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), we don't expect Meta to launch them at a wildly different price range than what's currently available.</p><p>At the most, they'll probably retail for $400-500, just like Oakley Meta HSTN. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-hypernova">Meta Hypernova</a>, the other, more advanced smart glasses that we expect to see unveiled at Meta Connect, are rumored to retail for $800, and there's no expectation that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) will cost anywhere near that price since they aren't expected to feature any display technology like the Hypernova.</p><p>Still, there's a high chance that they <em>could</em> be more expensive than the $250-300 price tag you would spend on the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but we'll have to wait and see. At the least, if Meta does release its new smart glasses before the end of the year, you could always pick up a discounted pair of Gen 2s during this year's Black Friday sales in November.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c1735587-6b06-45b0-9158-2d5ac1458a8b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBRsqTgAExr7KEXFFcCH9N.jpg' alt="A render of four different styles of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses stacked atop one another in a white void."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Style meets intelligence with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses!

But Garmin keeps reporting record-setting profits on watches while bumping up prices across its entire lineup. Who's to say the Fenix 8 Pro won't find a credulous audience? It's still cheaper than a Rolex!</p><p>In 2025, Garmin fans have grumbled about higher watch costs, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus subscription</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watches-are-reportedly-crashing-displaying-a-blue-triangle">massive bootloop crash</a>, and especially when Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/has-garmin-abandoned-the-fenix-7-pro-after-just-1-5-years/">cut off new features for the year-old Fenix 7 Pro</a> to push the Fenix 8. "I'll never buy a Garmin watch again" has been a pretty common refrain on forums, and rivals like COROS and Polar would happily take their business.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6986px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-3" alt="A photo of a man in the mountains wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to check his nearby mapped location." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVtGoqKtaHgc4d7bbtz6Mh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6986" height="3929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The 4,500-nit Garmin Fenix 8 Pro MicroLED </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This hasn't stopped Garmin from climbing into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP53613925">5th-best-selling wearable brand in 2025</a>, with a nearly 30% year-over-year growth, closing in on Samsung in 4th.

Upgraded sensors, better hardware, and new health features are the norm. The onus is on them to convince <em>you</em> to keep paying the same price every year or two.</p><p>Garmin takes a very different approach. It usually takes 2–3 years to sell a new watch in each lineup, and it charges more for every new feature. So when the Forerunner 570 added a mic, speaker, and better health sensors, Garmin logic meant that it <em>couldn't</em> cost the same as the Forerunner 265 anymore.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">Garmin's price tier strategy</a> means certain tools, such as dual-band GPS or a mic & speaker, will never come to cheaper watches.

I'd say $500 is the cutoff: Most of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watch</a> picks cost less than that, and you likely don't <em>need</em> to spend more than that, except for these specific scenarios:</p><ul><li>You're someone who goes on all-day hikes and can't make do with a smartphone map app, or backpack for days with limited access to power sources.</li><li>You regularly go skiing, diving, surfing, or other more specific sports that lower-end models don't track as well.</li><li>You want to leave your phone at home for workouts and use the Fenix 8 Pro's LTE calling and satellite messaging — at least until we get <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-should-make-more-pro-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-but-theres-a-challenge">more affordable Garmin LTE watches</a>.</li></ul><p>Outside of these use cases, you can find everything you need under $500 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> (mic and speaker, 5th-gen sensors with ECG, a sleeker design); Instinct 3 (military-grade ruggedness, flashlight, longer battery life with a solar option); or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> (dual-band GPS, training load, run coach plans, daily workout recs).</p><p>Garmin makes these watches feel like compromise picks to upsell you, but everything else a premium watch would offer — titanium cases, voice commands, spare hours of GPS tracking — is probably something you can live without.</p><p>Of course, I love my extra-fancy, overkill Garmin watches and would be a hypocrite to say you <em>shouldn't</em> overspend on expensive maps, rich-people sports, and excess battery life. Grab yourself a premium Fenix 8 Pro or Forerunner 970 and enjoy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Displays and side rails are almost universally flat across companies and product lines. Batteries are big. Ultrawide and telephoto cameras are all but standard. Even the corners of phones are nearly all rounded out. Some of these trends are great, others I could do without.</p><p>But, for far too many years, companies have used ugly, annoying protruding lenses that are too often aligned to the top-left of the phone. This not only makes the lenses prone to breaking if the phone is dropped, but it also makes the phone uneven.

There's no denying the similarities here.</p><p>Ever since the Pixel 6, Google has shown the world that a camera bar is the superior way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">to house all that clunky camera hardware</a> in an elegant fashion. After all, there's no way to keep a phone feeling thin and still deliver the camera quality people want without a big ol' camera lens sticking out of the back. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are probably the epitome of this concept.</p><p>However, many companies attempted to take the "simple" approach by placing the camera sensors behind large, protruding lenses on the backs of phones. This design is not only ugly (in my opinion), but it also invites dust collection, makes phones feel unevenly weighted, causes wobble, and even sometimes puts lenses right where your fingers hold the phone while taking a picture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SakchhEdr75XeQLJMZpBb5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-camera-island-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SakchhEdr75XeQLJMZpBb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Camera islands like those on Pixel phones fix <em>all</em> of those problems.

They even cut down on dust collection by removing all those extra protruding spaces.</p><p>They're even aesthetically nicer, adding beautiful symmetry to the design and some more interesting angles and design elements that spice up the boring black rectangles we've all grown used to.</p><p>The problem is that, while Apple and Samsung are copying Google's design, they're forgetting one of the most important parts: flatness.</p><h2 id="google-is-the-only-one-doing-it-right-2">Google is the only one doing it right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JCK2iWnKJoXsxGtKXB7dCo" name="galaxy-s26-iphone-17-render-leak-with-official-pixel-10-pro-render" alt="Leaked renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge and Apple iPhone 17 Pro alongside an official render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JCK2iWnKJoXsxGtKXB7dCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Galaxy S26 via OnLeaks x Android Headlines, iPhone 17 renders via MacRumors, official Google Pixel 10 Pro render via Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you look at the angled renders of the Galaxy S26 Edge, iPhone 17 Pro, and Google Pixel 10 Pro above, you'll probably notice something strange about the camera lenses on two of the three phones. That's right, both Samsung and Apple seem to have misunderstood <em>the entire purpose</em> of the camera island.</p><p>Instead of flattening the backs and completely solving the problem of asymmetry and wobble, both of these companies have only reduced those issues. The lenses still protrude, and while there's little doubt that these all will wobble less than previous designs, this should have solved those issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's excellent camera visor design is not only completely flat across the entire surface, but it has a really classy layer of metal trimming the outside and the right quarter of the design. This helps beef up durability over time and reduces the number of glass surfaces that could break in the event of a drop.</p><h2 id="google-is-setting-a-design-standard-2">Google is setting a design standard</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3671px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-21" alt="The Pixel 10 lying flat on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3671" height="2065" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm really glad to see the camera visor making its way into a more standardized smartphone design format, even if Google still does it best.

But at $109? You'll never see a new Google or Samsung watch at that price; you'd have to compare the TicWatch Pro 5 against budget brands like Amazfit that can't compete with Wear OS for software, even if it's an older version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what I didn't expect to like as much as I did is Google's flavor of Android 16. It's vibrant, responsive, and it brings some welcome changes that I've been hoping to see on Pixel software.</p><p>That said, the Pixel UI has never been my favorite, and while I like the changes Google has made with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, there are still some things I would like to see Google implement in future versions of Android. In fact, many of these features feel so commonplace on other Android phones, I'm surprised Google hasn't implemented them on Pixels.</p><h2 id="quick-settings-2">Quick Settings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-03" alt="Quick Settings on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JqS9eaPkcEVDuG9xkxBEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4183" height="2353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps my favorite change to Pixel UI is with the Quick settings. I wasn't a huge fan of the unnecessarily large tiles in previous versions, which limited the number of tiles you could view at a time compared to One UI. But now, Google lets you customize the Quick Settings panel more than I thought it would ever allow.</p><p>You can now resize any tile simply by long-pressing it. You only get two choices, which are essentially 1x1 or 2x1, but it allows you to fit more tiles onto the panel and provide it with more personality, letting you highlight the most important tiles if you so choose.</p><p>That said, there still are some annoying quirks that haven't been addressed with Android 16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-4" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcHg4kMeTR7PrPTyagWRHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4223" height="2375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a feature called "Quick Settings," I feel like it's not that great at actually offering quick access to some essential settings. For some reason, it takes two swipes of the panel in order to access the brightness slider, which is annoying when I want to quickly adjust it beyond the auto brightness.</p><p>Additionally, the actual Settings button is also inaccessible until the second swipe. Sure, I could have an icon on the home screen or swipe through the app drawer, but I prefer not to clutter my home screen with apps/widgets. I may just be spoiled by Samsung's Quick Settings, which gives you immediate access to the Settings icon after one swipe down.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-08" alt="Holding the Moto G Power 2025 and showing the quick settings panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I would love to see Google add an option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-change-back-to-single-notification-quick-settings-panel-one-ui-7">separate the notification panel and Quick Settings menu</a>. I've gotten used to this on Samsung and Motorola phones, and I have started to prefer it since it shows more tiles or notifications at once, and I can easily swipe between the two panels.</p><h2 id="multitasking-2">Multitasking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-5" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with the multitasking view open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57BGqnNs7pVgcpNNruax5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Google is focused on improving the multitasking experience on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, the experience on its traditional phones feels a bit lacking.</p><p>The Open Apps view simply displays large cards side by side, which doesn't offer a particularly helpful view of your apps. This isn't a huge deal, but it doesn't feel as useful as the Open Apps view from other OEMs. Furthermore, while access to features like Screenshot and the text selector are useful, I would like the option to see recommended apps to quickly jump into one.</p><p>Also, it doesn't make sense to me that I have to swipe all the way to the right in order to find the Clear All button. Even Motorola allows me to open the view and tap Clear All without swiping. I can also lock an app to the Open Apps view so that it stays open when I clear the rest, which is helpful when I'm streaming YouTube Music, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-6" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Razr Ultra 2025 with an open side panel of apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DjteYa4P7bQ2GESnwDyqGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One feature I've been begging to see on Pixels is a native side panel. This is a space to quickly access your favorite or most-used apps simply by swiping from the side of the display on nearly any screen. It's incredibly useful, and usually the first thing I set up when using a new phone. It's also available on just about every other smartphone I've tested, from Samsung to TECNO, so it's odd that Google <em>still </em>hasn't included an option for it, despite giving us a taskbar on foldables.</p><h2 id="more-customization-2">More customization</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-7" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> come with some level of customization, and the Pixel UI has improved on this front, especially with the aforementioned Quick Settings. That said, while there is a decent amount of customization, I would like to see more.</p><p>The Open Apps view is just one example; Google should let us <em>choose</em> the style in which apps are presented. Same with the Quick Settings menu; we should be able to further rearrange, resize, and change the style of the tiles and panel. Samsung does a great job of letting you rearrange the different elements on Quick Settings, and that would be a great starting point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-stacked-widget" alt="A stacked widget on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QwefJKDp6nLVP78xzBqyrS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3008" height="1692" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But even more than that, Google should let us customize other aspects of the Pixel UI, such as the shape of app icons and content shown on the status bar, allowing us to choose which icons we want presented and how. OnePlus offers this on its phones, and I always appreciated this as a way to declutter the top of my screen.</p><p>And as someone who prefers a cleaner home screen, I would also love to be able to stack widgets.</p><h2 id="best-of-both-worlds-2">Best of both worlds?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-1" alt="Pixel 10 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus with Google Lock open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTYuydExpAGrAN85qrg6TU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of smaller things, too, which could add up to some pretty granular customization options. However, Android has always been about providing its users with options, and while many like the Pixel UI for what it is, offering the option for deeper customization could go a long way.</p><p>Maybe Google could launch a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>-style app (perhaps called "Pixelate"), which gives users more ways to customize their phones without Google needing to mess with the core Pixel experience. It would give us the best of both worlds.</p><p>What Pixel UI changes would you like to see? Sound off in the comments below!</p> ]]></dc:content>

This particular case was brought forward by people tasked to look out for our best interests, not those of Google's competitors or up-and-coming companies.</p><p>Did it?</p><h2 id="who-are-the-winners-here-2">Who are the winners here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR" name="WWDC 2025 — Apple Intelligence and Apple Devices" alt="Screenshot of WWDC with Apple Intelligence and Apple devices on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4NsoYm7QWdNXLMmer3dyR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's easy to think that Google won another case after it had already lost it; Google was found to be a monopoly that used unfair practices to maintain its monopoly standing. However, the penalties are somewhat lackluster and are unlikely to have a significant impact on Google's business or its bottom line. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/google-antitrust-search-ruling.html" target="_blank">Stocks in the company rose almost 8% over this "good" news</a>.</p><p>While that's true, other companies wanted or needed an outcome like this, and the biggest is one you might not have thought of: Apple.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-reportedly-pay-15-billion-dominate-search-apple-devices">paid Apple about 20 billion dollars in 2022</a> to be the default search engine on the iPhone. It can keep doing it. Google's not allowed to attach any other strings to the deal, like saying the contract must be exclusive, but Apple can keep collecting those huge annual payments, which equal about one-fifth of the company's services revenue.</p><p>In addition, Apple can enter contracts with other companies to promote their search engines and have fewer restrictions on how it builds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">a relationship with an AI partner</a>. Google may not like having OpenAI be Apple's default AI engine, but it could be. That makes competing AI companies, like OpenAI or Perplexity, winners here, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF" name="Google-apps-on-iphone-16" alt="Google-widget-apps-iphone16-pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7E8ciMLfm8eJKRXXMzusF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smaller companies are also better off because of the decision to allow Google to continue to enter deals for a default search service. Mozilla, in particular, would have a very difficult time staying afloat without Google's help.</p><p>Because Google can continue with Chrome as normal, almost every company making a web browser wins, too. While they may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1963012916875231354" target="_blank">complaining on social media</a>, CEOs of companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/brave-browser-secretly-installing-vpn">Brave</a> know that nobody will continue to support the code base that makes their product possible the way Google has been doing.</p><h2 id="who-are-the-losers-2">Who are the losers?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo" name="Microsoft-logo.jpg" alt="The Microsoft logo at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3774" height="2123" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When someone "wins," it means someone has to lose as well. I see two outright losers from this decision: Microsoft and Internet publishers.</p><p>Microsoft doesn't need Google to continue to support and maintain Chromium, even though its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/have-you-tried-microsofts-new-edge-browser">Edge browser</a> uses the engine. It's entirely capable of doing it and would have been happy to do so if it meant its web browser market share could grow as Chrome collapsed. Having Google still doing most everything it has been doing means Microsoft will need to spend more money to compete.</p><p>Lastly, internet publishers will now see Google, whose AI is already affecting business models, sharing some of the data it collects with competitors. That means even more AI companies will be able to sidestep actual web articles in favor of an AI-generated response, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">reducing web traffic and revenue</a> for the companies producing the content. Many had hoped for some sort of "opt-out" of AI web indexing without being penalized in proper search results, but that was not part of the ruling.</p><h2 id="so-what-about-us-2">So what about us?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV" name="google-io-2021-keynote-3-billion-android-devices.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2021 Keynote 3 Billion Android Devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PbCAker93FMnB5iSzuEETV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's interesting to see how this court ruling will affect the finances of tech companies, what's most important to me (and many of you) is what it means for us, the over 3 billion Google customers who use the company's products and services.</p><p>The news is decidedly neutral. The suit may have been brought to protect users like you and me, but the result doesn't really do much there. Google will continue to do everything it has been doing when it comes to the consumer, even though there are some restrictions placed on how the company can finagle finances.</p><p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> will work the same as they ever did. So will YouTube, and Gmail. It's possible we see some slight differences when it comes to Search, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">that's been such a mess lately</a>, would we even notice?</p><p>The one way this ruling directly affects users is that Google has to share some search index and user-interaction data with competitors. The details aren't set in stone, and the judge did realize that this subject needs to be approached carefully, but the data you generate and provide to Google will end up in the hands of other companies.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-decision-sept-2025/" target="_blank">Google says,</a> "<em>We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely,</em>" but doesn't suggest it will appeal the decision outright.</p><p>The difference here is that previously, we knew the vast amounts of data Google collected on all of us were kept in-house. Now some of it won't be. That may or may not be a bad thing.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1963017984777064833">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Unless you have some sort of financial tie to Google and its products or services, there isn't much to process here.

According to AC contributor Brady Synder, Lenovo has made one for creativity and the other for productivity.</p><p>The Lenovo Yoga Tab is pretty much a mid-range tablet for creators and digital natives, with a focus on a high-resolution display and preloaded creative software. The tablet features an 11.1-inch LTPS display, is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor at its core, and ships with Android 15 pre-installed.  As for its battery, it gets a massive 8,860mAh battery that supports 68W wired charging, providing up to 12 hours of usage. For cameras, it has a dual rear setup with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP macro lens, while the front camera is also 13MP.</p><p>As for the Lenovo Idea Tab Plus, it sees a larger 12.1-inch screen, a MediaTek Dimensity 6400 chipset, and the same Android 15 OS out of the box. According to Snyder, the Idea Tab Plus "is more affordable, and there are also a few neat perks that come with this tablet." There are more color options, too: Luna Grey, Cloud Grey, and Sand Rose.</p><h2 id="google-drops-september-update-for-pixels-2">Google drops September update for Pixels</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW" name="Google-Pixel-10-hands-on-display-Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel 10 models with different color home screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-september-security-update-pixels-slides-fixes-for-the-whole-series"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google's September security patch landed this week as well and brought a fix to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>' display, where the screen would turn black during transitions from a webpage in an in-app browser.

Last year, the company's Ear Open was spotted moving through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-certification-spotted">Singapore's IMDA certification</a> database. While it was a surprise to most, especially since we weren't expecting an open-ear style product, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">launched the device</a> a month later in September 2024.</p><p>Currently, we're closing out the first week of September, and Nothing's officially teasing its upcoming Ear 3 product.</p><p>The Nothing Ear Open debuted in the middle of September last year, so maybe we're looking at a similar choice this year with the Ear 3. As far as more traditional-looking buds go, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-ear-a-confirmation">Nothing Ear launched in late April</a> last year, part of the company's name change rework to better focus on the "product" and "unique experience" for users. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">buds feature</a> 11mm dynamic drivers, 46mAh in each bud, and a 500mAh battery case.</p><p>Funnily enough, we thought we were moving into the Ear 3 last year when the company first started teasing the Ear and Ear a, but that's not what happened. Instead, in 2025, we're seeing the Ear 3 finally come around. While the Nothing Ear can handle rumbling bass and sub-bass, with other such audio refinements, it remains to be seen how the Ear 3 takes things further.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Screen protectors are Android phone accessories that feel almost mandatory to keep your gadgets safe against cracks and scratches. However, as a review that tests many phones and even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a>, I find them to be wildly inconvenient. They're difficult to apply, it can be hard to find them in stock at stores near you when you need them, and can need replacing often. There might be a better way, and I tried it at the Zagg booth at IFA 2025.</p><p>Zagg's On-Demand InvisibleShield machine is sort of like a kiosk for custom screen protectors. Name just about any device model and pick a film screen protector variant, like matte or privacy, and order it like you would a coffee. There is information for thousands of devices stored in the Zagg On Demand machine, with the precise measurements for each.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-4" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q8uiieSNBNe5dkPCjKdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This wide-ranging support for phone and device models is extremely useful for niche models, or new and old ones. For instance, if you want to get a screen protector in your home country for a phone that isn't generally available there — think using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> in the U.S. — you're probably out of luck at a big box retailer. However, a shop with an On Demand machine can cut a film for your uncommon device or ten-year-old phone in minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-5" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asmLgKoSAAVMGgWsvnmKdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After you name your device, you'll need to pick a film screen protector type. A notable limitation of the On Demand machine is that it can't cut tempered glass screen protectors, only TPU film. A Zagg representative told me that's why there aren't as many Zagg On Demand service providers in the U.S. as there are in Europe; the American market prefers tempered glass over film.</p><p>Personally, I find matte film screen protectors to be the perfect mix of feature set and protection. The matte finish helps diffuse sunlight for better visibility, and the film protects your screen from scratches without being another thing for you to crack.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-3" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjqYSPxh57u6dMb2UHqbX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can choose from Zagg's InvisibleShield Defense, Elite, or Extreme film screen protector types depending on the feel you're looking for. From there, you can choose either Ultra Eco (biodegradable), Ultra Matte (anti-glare), Elite VisionGuard (blue-light blocking), or Privacy Matte versions. After that, an operator will put your chosen film into the machine, it'll precision-cut it, and soon it'll be ready to be applied.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX" name="Zagg-Screen-Protector-1" alt="Zagg's On Demand screen protector machine cutting film for a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2a65tXi7USicXJFGPrpYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In just a few minutes, you'll end up with something like I did in the photo above — a phone with a cut-to-order screen protector. I was fascinated by the process, and find there to be a few major advantages to this kind of service. For one, you're getting an expert to install your screen protector. If you don't like how it turns out, you can address that right then and there without having to go through a return or warranty process.</p><p>There's also the fact that this process allows stores to provide screen protectors for far more devices than they ever could with pre-packaged kits. It's an approach that uses less waste as well. Even large retailers like Best Buy struggle to keep a variety of screen protectors in stock for same-day pickup, but with Zagg On Demand, it's nearly instant.</p><p>Zagg has been using On Demand machines for over five years now, and I hope they catch on more. It's cool to watch, and has too many practical benefits for both businesses and customers to ignore.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lau confirmed that OnePlus is in the process of developing its new DetailMax Engine to deliver "clarity and authenticity" for users and their captured photos. Lau states that, to create the DetailMax Engine, he was involved in interviews with a wide range of users about what they want most out of such software.</p><p>Users informed OnePlus that they want "clear and real" photos, and pictures that remain crisp and detailed even when pinching to zoom.</p><p>Lau says the company's DetailMax Engine computational imaging software has evolved to a point where it can "capture and interpret vastly more data, delivering images with unmatched depth and realism." The company states its new in-house engine will never mask photos with "over-beautification or distortion," once again highlighting the true-to-life, in a way, appeal of a user's photography.</p><p>Lau informs users that testing for the early prototype is underway, and that he's been involved in it so far. The company says the engine should be ready by launch, meaning all the wrinkles and things should be ironed out. Lau thanks Hasselblad for guiding OnePlus toward this imaging future it's racing toward and states it's excited for new opportunities, whatever those may be.</p><h2 id="the-end-of-an-era-2">The End of an Era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZD9tpSMioRfEMgypYQLecH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/more-rumors-oneplus-15-in-house-camera-system-reported">settle with rumors</a> about OnePlus' supposed departure from Hasselblad thus far, and the most recent ones shed more (alleged) light on it.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">AYN Thor</a>, a dual-screen clamshell handheld, is the first and it's still available to pre-order via Indiegogo. The second is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-announces-dual-screen-thor-and-next-gen-odin-3-handhelds">AYN Odin 3</a>, arriving as the long-awaited successor to the ever-popular Odin 2. Instead of just dropping both the Thor and Odin 3 at the same time, AYN opted to let the hype build for the Thor first, and now it's time for the Odin 3.</p><p>More than anything else, the most exciting aspect of the Odin 3 is the chip at the helm. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the same SoC found in many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released over the past year. This marks the first handheld to be announced with the 8 Elite, although we suspect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">AYANEO's KONKR Pocket FIT</a> will soon follow.</p><h2 id="ayn-odin-3-specs-2">AYN Odin 3 Specs</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUf13ignOxk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>AYN Odin 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6-inch AMOLED, 1920 x 1080, 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB/12GB/16GB/24GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (UFS 3.1) / 256GB/512GB/1TB (UFS 4.0) + microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>8,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Active Cooling, DisplayPort Alt Mode, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Beyond that, the AYN Odin 3 looks not all that dissimilar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0DT4G4PD2">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, albeit with a larger screen and more comfortable ergonomics. Some of the other specs include a 6-inch AMOLED display, with a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a massive 8,000mAh battery.</p><p>AYN is offering a total of four different configurations, starting with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 expandable storage for the base model.

It's that pricing starts at just $299, and even if you max out the RAM and storage, it's only $499.</p><p>The only device released this year that gets even close to that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-astra-oled-gaming-tablet-ive-always-wanted">RedMagic Astra</a> tablet at $549. But that's just for the base model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you wanted to match configs between the Astra and Odin 3, the former would set you back $899, $400 more than AYN's handheld.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn" name="ayn-odin-3-product-lifestyle-4" alt="AYN Odin 3 product lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's absolutely wild to see AYN not only release a new flagship handheld, but doing so at an extremely affordable price.

Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Amazon has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMMM8C?tag=georiot-us-default-20&ascsubtag=ac-us-3688411855129470036-20&geniuslink=true&th=1"><strong>cut the price for the Galaxy S25 Edge from $1,099 to $699</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Is it worth buying?</p><p>That's about the same price as the supposed budget model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-galaxy-s25-fe">Galaxy S25 FE</a>. This doesn't fix anything that you might think is "wrong" with the S25 Edge, except now the price isn't stupidly crazy expensive. That could be enough reason to make it your next new phone.</p><p>Let's dive in.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung makes a lot of different phones at just about every "level" of quality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">The S25 Edge</a> is clearly designed to be on the premium side of it all.</p><p><strong>It's fast</strong>. Samsung will take the magic inside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Qualcomm Snapdragon chip</a> and sprinkle some extra secret stuff on it, and make incredibly responsive phones. Inside, the S25 Edge has mostly the same parts as its thicker brother, the "regular" S25, and that means it will be nice and snappy to use.</p><p><strong>The display is awesome</strong>. Samsung makes some of the best displays, both phone-sized and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/stunning-8k-tv-samsung-has-zero-bezels">big old TV-sized</a>, that you can buy. That's why many other companies buy them from the Korean tech giant. The S25 Edge has a beautiful display, and that's the part of the phone you pay the most attention to.</p><p><strong>It's thin and light</strong>. Titanium is not a great material for anything that will run hot, like a phone, but its other properties - namely, its sturdiness and light weight- make it desirable. The S25 Edge is a really thin phone that only weighs about 160 grams. It's <em><strong>the </strong></em>highlight of the product and where it takes its name.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Three things instantly come to mind here, and no price reduction will "fix" them.</p><p><strong>The camera</strong>. I won't try and tell you the camera system on the Galaxy S25 Edge sucks, because it doesn't. In fact, I'll wager it's better than a lot of other phones you can buy today. But it's not as good as the cheaper "regular" model and nowhere near as good as what you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>. That was a much bigger problem when the price was the same or higher than any of those phones, but it's still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-took-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-to-a-concert-to-see-if-telephoto-lenses-are-overrated">lacking when it comes to getting up close and personal</a>.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong>. A thin phone means a thin battery, and even Samsung hasn't been able to change physics to allow otherwise. The battery life on the S25 Edge can be decent, but it can also be a disaster depending on how much you use it throughout the day and what you're trying to do with it. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, smaller batteries equal less time between charges.</p><p><strong>The thinness and heat</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> inside the S25 Edge gets hot as Hades. It is supposed to get that hot; there's nothing wrong with it. The issue is that with a phone so thin, moving that heat away fast enough can become an issue. Samsung did everything right, but without the sheer mass and being made with titanium, the phone will need to throttle down the speed more often than others. If you live in the Yukon, this might not be an issue. If you live in Arizona, well ...</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>This Amazon deal fixes the biggest, most glaring issue with the Galaxy S25 Edge: its price tag. But it doesn't change anything else.</p><p>If you really want a super thin phone, for whatever reason, well, this is the phone you should be buying. Do it now, while it's on sale, so you won't have to spend way too much money on it.</p><p>If you need a great camera with a superb telephoto lens system, this phone is not for you, and no price reduction can change that. Most everything else is in place, but digital zoom is so 2010.</p><p>If you like to constantly check your phone or play games for hours on end, you're not going to love the battery life. No mincing words here, it's made smaller and can't provide as much juice as other S25 models.</p><p>For a lot of people, this will be an awesome phone to have. It would probably work great for me, in fact.

The publication states that Samsung has reached out to its suppliers with new numbers for September. This month, the company reportedly plans to produce 260,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> units, a notable 60,000-unit increase from its original plan.</p><p>It appears that the popularity of the latest book-style foldable has forced Samsung to produce more. Additionally, the post claims that Samsung's Fold 7 production in 2025 could "exceed" its "annual expectations."</p><p>However, the post says that Samsung had to increase its Fold 7 production in August, too, by roughly 100,000 units. It adds that "early adopters" (pre-orders) are a major catalyst behind the Fold 7's extreme production boost on Samsung's side. This is something that was reported before, especially following the company's summer Unpacked event.</p><h2 id="the-popular-one-2">The popular one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding the publication's "early adopters" note, in July, reports rushed in about the Galaxy Z Fold 7's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">stunning performance</a> in South Korea. It was reported that, for the first time ever, the Fold 7's pre-orders were more popular than the Flip 7. The larger foldable pulled 60% of the pre-orders following Unpacked, which is a stark turnaround from the Flip 6's 70% dominance in 2024.</p><p>It seems that the changes and upgrades made to the Fold 7 have pushed people to reconsider their foldable of choice. Of course, the Fold 7 has received a thinner build, and it's also much lighter than it previously was.</p><p>That's not all, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">Samsung also paraded its Fold 7 around</a>, detailing everything new and improved that consumers can expect. One of the major highlights is that, through its screen tests, the Fold 7 is expected to survive roughly 500,000 folds. In layman's terms, Samsung states this should last the "average user" around 10 years. The phone's UTG (ultra thin glass) was also improved, meaning the phone's crease throughout these thousands of folds should remain minimal.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="73694d2c-660e-477a-938e-e8606f4f7225">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

The best part is that no trade-in is required, although if you <em>do</em> have an old phone to send in, Verizon is offering up to $649.99 of credit, just for kicks. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6447740d-fa69-4d59-821a-ee264524a4e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1238px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.16%;"><img id="4FYypHdUkQhbMLDmoskgSe" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FYypHdUkQhbMLDmoskgSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1238" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe/" data-dimension112="6447740d-fa69-4d59-821a-ee264524a4e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$649.99</del> <strong>FREE with eligible data plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>Although the deal is somewhat buried on Verizon's website, new and existing subscribers can actually get a <strong>free </strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE when they add a line with the carrier's Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, or Unlimited Ultimate plan. That's a pretty bold offer for a phone that was literally just unveiled earlier this week. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6447740d-fa69-4d59-821a-ee264524a4e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>With a starting price of $649.99, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE isn't exactly a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, but it does offer a lot of bang for the buck and flagship-level specs at a lower cost than the rest of the Galaxy S25 series. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 FE</a> features a gorgeous 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with IP68 water/dust resistance, plus a nice matte finish and aluminum side rails for a sleek look. Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the 'Fan Edition' Samsung phone also boasts an upgraded Exynos chipset, 8GB of RAM, and One UI 8 straight out of the box. </p><p>The phone also comes with a triple array camera system, much like the rest of the S25 lineup, with an upgraded 12MP front-facing camera that's perfect for taking selfies. Furthermore, the Galaxy S25 FE comes with a large 4,900mAh battery (that's a bigger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>), all of the latest AI software tools, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AbkdzoFSTR7FC8KowH7oYF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-4" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbkdzoFSTR7FC8KowH7oYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the Galaxy S25 FE isn't a dramatic transformation over its predecessor, and it certainly isn't going to win any awards for revolutionizing performance, but it's a well-priced smartphone that's simply good at being a smartphone. That being said, it isn't that much cheaper than the standard Galaxy S25 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a>, so if you can find a good deal on those flagships, I'd probably skip the Galaxy S25 FE altogether.</p><p>That being said, if you're a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> and you want to try one of the best 'Fan Edition' phones released in years, then the S25 FE is a great buy, <em>especially </em>with a deal like this attached.  </p><p>It's not uncommon to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> advertise free phones, but it's always nice to see an offer that has so few strings attached. All three of the eligible data plans come with unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's vast 5G network, plus you'll receive access to a ton of useful international and entertainment perks. The Big Three carrier is even offering free $200 gift cards with select online purchases, so be sure to look into that when you buy to see if you're eligible. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The company just took it up a notch by introducing Voice Translate for phone calls in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> series.</p><p>This new feature in the phone app allows the AI voice model to translate what you're saying into another language, in real-time and in the sound of your speaking voice. If you live in the U.S. and you've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/first-things-to-do-with-the-google-pixel-10">just bought the Pixel 10</a>, here's how you can take advantage of Voice Translate on your next phone call.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-and-use-voice-translate-during-calls-on-the-pixel-10-2">How to set up and use Voice Translate during calls on the Pixel 10</h2><p>1. Open the <strong>Phone</strong> app, tap the <strong>hamburger</strong> menu and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Next, tap <strong>Voice translate</strong> and enable the toggle switch.</p><p>3. On the same page, choose the <strong>Language you speak</strong> and you can download additional languages if needed. Give it some time for the new language pack to finish downloading before trying it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.81%;"><img id="D8xHDQ8AXCZ5gb5reTqx4m" name="pixel-10-voice-translate-phone-calls-1" alt="Pixel Voice Translate in phone calls on Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D8xHDQ8AXCZ5gb5reTqx4m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>4. Once Voice translate is set up and enabled, make a call and tap <strong>Call Assist</strong>. Next, choose <strong>Voice translate</strong>.</p><p>5. You'll then get an option to select the speaking language of the caller.</p><p>6. Both parties will hear a brief automated message that says the call is translated by Google AI in each speaker's voice and that the audio is not saved.</p><p>7. After this, you simply continue the conversation normally, and the AI will translate your voice to the caller's language, but using your tone and speaking style. The same goes for the other party, and you'll hear their voice translated into your language.</p><p>8. The entire call will be transcribed on your Pixel 10 as the conversation goes on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.81%;"><img id="4QxCrNWBmAbn8XKQqoZCo4" name="pixel-10-voice-translate-phone-calls-2" alt="Google Pixel voice translate during calls on Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QxCrNWBmAbn8XKQqoZCo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: Voice Translate works even if the person you're calling doesn't have a Pixel 10. Both voices will still be translated to sound like each person. It works fairly well in our experience, and even though the translation is not always perfect, it doesn't really detract from the conversation.</p><h2 id="speak-your-mind-with-the-pixel-10-s-awesome-new-feature-2">Speak your mind with the Pixel 10's awesome new feature</h2><p>This live Voice Translate feature during phone calls is quite game-changing and helps break down the language barrier even further. It only works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> and later, which means Google can now do this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> and in near-real time thanks to the advancements made to the Tensor G5 chip. Currently, Voice Translate supports translation between English and the following languages:</p><ul><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Hindi</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Russian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swedish</li></ul><p>Just like the new Pixel Journal app, privacy is taken very seriously. Google explicitly states on its support page that no conversation audio or transcription is stored on the device. Conversations are never sent to Google, and neither are they retrievable after the call. The feature works even without an internet connection, further ensuring privacy. Voice Translate can be easily deactivated at any time, or you can turn it off for particular calls.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android smartphones</a> you can buy today, and features like Voice Translate really help separate it from the competition.

Google explicitly states on its support page that all the entries in the app, including the backed-up ones, are safe and that it doesn't use your entries for ads or to target ads to the user.</p><p>It also states that none of the journal entries are used to train its GenAI models. For transcribing audio, the Journal app uses an on-device Google service, so no data is sent to the cloud.</p><p>The Journal app's AI features are currently only available in English and Japanese, and you must be 18 years or older to use them. The AI-enabled features include "Deep dive," which offers different perspectives or fresh inspiration on your current topic. Mood ID chooses the most apt emoji for your entry, which can be found on the Insights tab. To get an AI-generated reflection for your entry, you need to have written at least five words.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a5d8bbc4-2395-42b9-82a0-8dab53b26a74">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The new standard</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 is one of the smartest phones you can buy thanks to the Tensor G5 chip and new Gemini AI features like Camera Coach and Magic Cue.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

What started as a nifty note-to-audio feature is now becoming a full-blown conversation machine that’s sharper, snappier, and far more expressive.</p><p>Instead of being stuck with the same old back-and-forth, you now get four flavors to choose from: <em>Deep Dive</em> for detailed analysis, <em>Brief </em>for quick rundowns, <em>Critique </em>for feedback-driven takes, and <em>Debate </em>for when you want two AI hosts to square off over your notes.</p><p>Perhaps the real star of the show is the debate mode because this is where it gets interesting. When you give NotebookLM a proposal or research draft, it can spin it into a podcast-style clip. Instead of a flat summary, you’ll hear multiple AI voices laying out a structured debate around your work.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨Rolling out NEW audio overview formats: (Default) Deep Dive: a thorough examination of your sourcesBrief: 1-2 minute, bite-sized overviewsCritique: an expert review, offering constructive feedback on your materialDebate: a thoughtful debate between two hosts pic.twitter.com/m3z3yASMyF<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1962949985546187120">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="you-control-the-conversation-2">You control the conversation</h2><p>You can also adjust the tone and runtime of these AI podcasts, meaning you can choose between a fast one-minute overview or a deeper, extended analysis.</p><p>The updates don’t stop there.

There are a few exceptions, but none that would be able to match up with Samsung's flagship tablet lineup.</p><p>Since the first Ultra Galaxy Tab was released with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8">Tab S8 series</a>, I've considered the line to be the absolute best that money can buy. And it appears, at least from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Brady's initial impressions</a>, that will continue with the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra once it's released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's just something about the almost 15-inch display that draws me in, combined with the premium design, S Pen, and expandable storage. The Tab S11 Ultra checks all of those boxes yet again, managing to get even slimmer than before, while retaining most of the same features as before, save for the move back to a single selfie camera.</p><p>Now, a question pops into my head that I haven't been able to really answer: what can Samsung possibly do next? There are some outside-the-box ideas that come to mind, such as turning it into a foldable device, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovos-new-16-inch-thinkpad-x1-fold-is-the-most-flexible-versatile-windows-pc-ever" target="_blank">Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Fold</a>, that runs Android.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="xFE9fssxFzGsst56Rnk9fb" name="lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-wc" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold with Keyboard attached and propped on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFE9fssxFzGsst56Rnk9fb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps that's the most logical next move, because I don't really think Samsung, or any other company, can do anything else that would be considered "ground-breaking." At least not with keeping the "traditional" slab of glass or aluminum. I mean, the Tab S11 Ultra is just 5.1mm thin, which is 0.3mm thinner than last year's model, and now matches up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">13-inch M4 iPad Pro</a>.</p><p>It's a weird thought to have, realizing that at least when it comes to the absolute best of the best, the ceiling has likely been reached. Provided that Samsung keeps the Ultra line around, I suspect we're in store for a bunch of minimal design changes (if any), paired with a spec bump and whatever potential changes to Android may be in store.</p><h2 id="where-else-can-samsung-improve-2">Where else can Samsung improve?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if this is "it" for the design, what's next?</p><p>I'm glad you asked! For one, I'd absolutely love to see Samsung stop gate-keeping RAM options for the 1TB model. With the Tab S11 Ultra, you have 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. The only way to get 16GB of RAM is to spring for 1TB of storage, and vice versa, and it's just maddening.</p><p>I understand profit margins and all that jazz, but come on now. Stick to one RAM config and make everyone happy. Maybe it wouldn't bother me as much if this were a one-off, but it's not. Samsung does the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as the only way to get the most RAM is to also get the highest storage capacity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Last year's Tab S10+ is the only cellular flagship Samsung tablet </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Besides that little frustration, the only other hardware change I'd like to see is for there to be a cellular option here in the States. As it's been done in years prior, the only way to get the Tab S Ultra with cellular connectivity is to import a model released in another country. Samsung isn't even offering a cellular Galaxy Tab S11 model, and instead is leaving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">Tab S10 Plus</a> to serve as the connected option, which is an odd choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZVbmhGeJG2Sn5cbtNMydWo" name="ipad-pro-2021-129-adm-2.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9 (2021) with iPhone on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVbmhGeJG2Sn5cbtNMydWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one more thing that I'd love, and I mean LOVE, to see Samsung do, and it doesn't even need to wait until the Tab S12 to do it: steal the iPad Pro keyboard design. If I'm working at a desk or table at the coffee shop, there's really nothing wrong with the Smart Cover Keyboard.</p><p>But the instant that I want to sit on the couch and use the tablet as a laptop with the keyboard, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">turns into a balancing act</a>. I like the idea of the removable back cover that doubles as a stand, but the actual keyboard portion is just not great. It's flimsy to the point that I accidentally click the trackpad if I push down too hard on one side or the other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-14" alt="iPad Pro M4 next to Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with keyboard cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>None of those are problems with the iPad Pro keyboard, and it's frustrating that Samsung hasn't even really tried changing things up with the design. And no, adding a dedicated AI key doesn't count, nor does offering the Book Cover Keyboard Slim, as it lacks a trackpad.</p><p>I mean, Samsung charges as much as some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, <em>just</em> for the Book Cover Keyboard ($350). Is it too much to ask for a keyboard case that lets me turn a laptop-sized tablet into an Android laptop?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Patn8Z3Ft6FSe8Jbzke8pW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Patn8Z3Ft6FSe8Jbzke8pW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not to mention that there isn't even a new Book Cover Keyboard launching with the Tab S11 Ultra, with only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-accessories/book-cover-keyboard-slim-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-sku-ef-dx930ubeguj">Slim version</a> being announced.

Meta Hypernova is a next-generation pair of smart glasses rumored to be announced on September 17, 2025, at Meta Connect 2025.</p><p>Meta Hypernova has been leaked and rumored for months and appears to be a middle ground between the full-fledged computer on your face, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, and current Meta AI-powered smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>. If I'm going to make any comparison, it's likely these are akin to a smartwatch on your face, as far as capabilities go.</p><p>They're also slated to ship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">with a gesture band</a> to make daily interaction a breeze. We've seen tons of leaks and info appear ahead of the official unveiling and have collected everything in one place below for your convenience. Here's everything you need to know about Meta Hypernova!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-hypernova-price-and-availability"><span>Meta Hypernova: Price and availability</span></h2><p>Meta Hypernova is expected to be announced at Meta Connect on September 17, 2025. The new smart glasses are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-low-sales-expectations-project-hypernova-smart-glasses-report">rumored to retail for $799</a> and are expected to be packaged with an sEMG gesture bracelet. The final retail product name is thought to be "Meta Celeste."</p><p>The glasses are slated to be available sometime later this fall, according to leaks, with Meta reportedly estimating that they will sell around 150,000 units in the first two years due to the price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-hypernova-design-and-features"><span>Meta Hypernova: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG" name="meta-hypernova-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of Meta Hypernova or Meta Celeste smart glasses and the sEMG wristband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1654" height="930" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna (@Lunayian) on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaked renders of Meta Hypernova, seen above, have a similar overall design to Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. The biggest difference between them is the thickness of the frames, as Hypernova has to fit a display in one of the lenses in addition to extra compute circuitry and a larger battery than Ray-Ban Meta or Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><p>A key differentiator between those smart glasses products and Hypernova is the inclusion of a single display in one of the lenses. It's not yet known if this is customizable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">but early reports</a> said the display will be in the bottom portion of the right lens. It's likely that Meta is using waveguide optics for Hypernova, as the company was seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-lets-engineers-talk-openly-about-ar-glasses-hardware-and-challenges">openly bragging about this tech recently</a>.</p><p>The small display in one lens would act similarly to the display on a smartwatch. Since it's small, Meta would need to keep things terse and deliver glanceable information. This will likely range from smartphone notifications to turn-by-turn directions. Leaks also note that a small app launcher can display six icons on screen, similar to the mockup we made in the image below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta Hypernova is likely using a similar version of the Android operating system that we used on Meta Orion last year. This OS resembles a lightweight version of the Meta Horizon Android-based OS, which powers VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. We expect Hypernova's OS to be even more pared down, though, and is unlikely to feature traditional windows or full-fledged apps like Orion runs.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the glasses will ship with a handful of dedicated apps, with the potential for Meta to add more apps down the road. Meta AI, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, a camera app, and a maps app are all thought to be pre-installed on each pair of Meta Hypernova smart glasses.</p><p>Unlike Meta Orion, Hypernova isn't supposed to have positional tracking. This means the glasses won't be able to overlay virtual objects onto the real world the way a Meta Quest headset currently can. We expect later versions of Meta glasses to be able to do this, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A next-generation version of onboard Meta AI is expected to launch with Meta Hypernova glasses. It's said this upgraded AI model is able to use live AI for longer and allows for more interactivity with Meta AI. This means that you can have Meta AI see and hear what you see for more of your day, helping you to remember where you left your car keys or even what someone's name is.</p><p>Google previously showed off a similar feature for its upcoming smart glasses, both at Google I/O 2025 and at a TED Talk <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">a few weeks earlier</a>. Meta is spending a lot on Meta AI this year, so expect these and several other new features to debut on Meta Hypernova.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-hypernova-gesture-bracelet"><span>Meta Hypernova: Gesture bracelet</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zXaNxo7WiqLpFZHknMNhTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-01" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zXaNxo7WiqLpFZHknMNhTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest differentiator between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR-powered smart glasses</a> and Meta Hypernova will be the way users interact with their glasses. The first batch of Android XR glasses will use a combination of Google Gemini and swiping on the side temple to interact with apps and notifications.</p><p>Meta Hypernova will also use Meta AI to interact with things, similar to how Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta smart glasses work, but users will find that hand gestures with the included sEMG bracelet work best.</p><p>An sEMG bracelet allows you to more naturally interact with virtual interfaces by just using your hands and supports a seemingly endless variety of gestures. This GIF below shows you some of the gestures Meta has developed, with a human hand on the left and a virtual representation of how the glasses "see" your hand on the right.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.25%;"><img id="2QnMCpKycu8mA25Fujgvib" name="meta-semg-band-gestures" alt="Examples of different hand gestures that the Meta sEMG band can recognize" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QnMCpKycu8mA25Fujgvib.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An sEMG bracelet works by reading the electrical impulses in your muscles and understands even the slightest movements you make with your hands. This enables a next-generation hand-tracked input, which I've used during my Meta Orion demo in 2024. It's not just extraordinarily effective; it feels like an evolutionary leap in interaction, the way that multitouch displays were back in 2007 when the iPhone launched.</p><p>This gives Meta a significant advantage over Google and its partners, as voice-only interaction is only so useful. There are plenty of situations when using voice interaction is either inappropriate, disruptive, or just plain impossible, and this band is here to solve that problem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's on par with what competing brands charge. Now I want Garmin to start bringing this Pro upgrade to a much wider range of watches, but I don't know if it'll be able to pull it off.</p><p>I understand Garmin choosing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a> as its launch point. Loyal users get first dibs on InReach cellular calls, satellite messaging, and emergency SOS, without losing the premium Fenix perks they already enjoy. And the Fenix 8's fantastic battery life ensures it can handle the extra battery burn from LTE connectivity.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that the Fenix 8 Pro costs $1,200 or more. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> fans expect inflated prices, but this stretches the budget most people want to spend. As great as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> is, not everyone will want a thick, titanium model when they can get a lighter Forerunner, longer-lived Enduro, or stylish Venu.</p><p>I want Garmin to launch "Pro" versions of its most popular models.

It'll probably start with premium models like the Tactix 8 for soldiers or Quatix 8 for sailors, for whom staying connected is vital. But I'd want the more accessible Forerunners, Instincts, and Venus to follow.</p><p>Here's the problem: look how physically <em>chunky</em> the Fenix 8 Pro is. Both the 47mm and 51mm Pro models are about 2mm thicker than their Fenix 8 counterparts. At 16mm and 16.5mm, they're blockier than nearly every<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness"> fitness watch</a> out there.</p><p>Garmin told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/09/garmin-fenix-8-pro-lte-microled-satellite-messaging-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know.html">DC Rainmaker</a> that "due to hardware limitations with integrating the LTE antenna," it couldn't make a 43mm Fenix 8 Pro size work. Engineering challenges meant it "wasn't possible" to make the cellular and satellite antennas small enough. They weren't "avoiding" making smaller, LTE-enabled watches as a long-term strategy, but it may not be feasible in the short term.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e5ZNbibquFyQLLZHdiG8qe" name="garmin-fenix-8-product-photo.jpeg" alt="Photo of the Garmin Fenix 8 on an athlete's wrist, showing a daily suggested workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5ZNbibquFyQLLZHdiG8qe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The too-small Fenix 8 43mm </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 13.8mm-thick Fenix 8 with a 1.3-inch display isn't what I'd call a <em>small</em> watch! So I'm skeptical that this first-gen antenna could fit inside any Venu model, whether it's the 12mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or 8mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>. That is, until Garmin's engineers can make one that's smaller but still offers strong connectivity.</p><p>Hopefully, watches like the Instinct 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> could fit a full-sized antenna inside. Even with the $100 LTE surcharge added, they'd cost half as much as the Fenix 8 Pro, with enough battery life for more casual athletes going on day hikes or nightly runs.</p><p>But maybe that's the problem. Garmin tends to price-lock certain features like offline maps to its most expensive models. Could Garmin decide to only add LTE and satellite to premium models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>?</p><p>I'm hoping Garmin strays from tradition here. It can sell off its $1,200 Fenix 8 Pro stock to superusers, but then it should bring this LTE/ satellite tech to a wider range of models — even if it's only the big ones to start. I'm sure there'll be a big audience for it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f49d2555-ae02-41df-9ac0-ef7b5808e653">            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-fenix-8-pro-amoled-sapphire-gps-smartwatch-47mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-titanium-at-t-2025/JXF9YFFS9G" data-model-name="Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mmd3NzuKnBtUGNKgxc397n.jpg' alt="Render of the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro AMOLED Sapphire GPS Smartwatch 47mm Titanium"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Fenix 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Hopefully starting a trend</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro adds LTE-M and Skylo satellite support to its flagship watch.

In addition, it's released a new portable speaker, the SoundLink Plus, which we found to be one of the best in its price point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-soundlink-plus-review" target="_blank">in our full review</a>. And now we have the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra to look forward to.</p><p>Announced today (Sept. 5) for preorder and available on October 2, 2025, for $449, the second-generation QuietComforts see a $20 jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review" target="_blank">2023's launch</a>, likely due to the inclusion of USB-C audio. They'll be available in Black, White Smoke, and in two new limited-edition colors, Midnight Violet and Driftwood Sand, with what Bose is calling "a new premium design with polished metal materials and colorways."</p><p>In a press release, Bose states that the most impactful upgrade to the new headphones is their improved on-head detection, which will automatically start up when connected to paired devices after being placed on your head. They'll go into a low-power standby mode that Bose says will last for months when you take them off and lay them flat or place them back into their carrying case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6dRjEDZaKMAjKnDmoJv5EH" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-midnight-violet-169" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in Midnight Violet over an other worldly background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dRjEDZaKMAjKnDmoJv5EH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bose)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, given the ANC battle for supremacy between Bose and Sony, it may be that the most impactful update is the improved AI-powered ActiveSense adaptive noise-cancelling algorithms, which could place Bose as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones" target="_blank">market leader in active noise-cancelling</a>.</p><p>Among the new updates and features, Bose claims to have improved battery life by six hours, now reaching 30 hours with ANC on, and 23 hours with Immersive Audio activated.

When the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) are drained, 15 minutes of quick charge will get you three hours of playback.</p><p>Like much of the competition, Bose has added USB-C audio support this year, which accommodates 16-bit, 44.1kHz, or 48kHz lossless audio files.

According to Woodward, nano banana, the Gemini app's imaging editing model, is the catalyst behind the 10 million-plus users who've started using its AI services. More than that, Woodward says nano banana has already edited over 200 million images for users in its short life in the app.</p><p>The post on X adds, "TPUs red hot. SRE pagers howling."</p><p>While there are "many prompts going viral around the world simultaneously," Woodward says, there's one in particular people are enjoying: the figurine prompt.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1962647019090256101">highlights a post</a> by its Gemini app account, which puts a spotlight on users being able to turn a photo of themself, and others, into figurines on a desk. The account also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1962647022068187208">gave an example prompt</a> for users looking to try it out for themselves. Google says Gemini's nano banana can turn a photo of you, your pet, and your family into a unique figurine—box included and all—sitting on a desk.</p><h2 id="going-nano-bananas-2">Going (Nano) Bananas</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🍌update:200M+ images edited10M+ people are new to @GeminiApp - welcome!TPUs red hotSRE pagers howling<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1963627742618165270">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Google had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">major update drop for Gemini's photo editing</a> capabilities, which saw the AI lean on DeepMind. The built-in editor, "nano banana," lets the AI use a user's prompt for better image generation/editing. In short, users can blend photos, mix up designs, and more. For blending, users can tell Gemini to combine two separate photos into one, as if they were always like that.</p><p>Users can even let their imagination shine for selfies. With your prompt, Gemini can turn you into a space-walking astronaut, a rock star, or anything else you can think of. Mixing up designs is sort of like a continuous editing session with Gemini. Users can tell Gemini what to add to an empty room (for example) and continue to tweak its design. It's sort of like follow-up questions, but you're simply expanding and adding onto your ideas with the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A Weather app has already been available on Pixel Watches since Wear OS 3 in 2022, but Google is now launching Pixel Weather on Pixel Watch models starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>One of the major features here is that the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch brings the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> to the app, even though the layout is similar to what's currently available on Wear OS.

Above the card, you see the city name and the current time. The background also reflects the weather, just like on the phone app.</p><p>Alongside the app, Google has also updated the watch face tiles for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pixel-weather-app-just-got-a-handy-update-for-unit-measurements">Pixel Weather</a>. There are now three tiles available: one with temperature, high/low, and precipitation chance; one with sunrise/sunset times; and one with UV index. In all tiles, the time and city appear above the weather info. The publication also notes that watch face complications are coming.</p><p>There's no confirmed release date yet for the Pixel Weather app on Pixel Watch, but it is expected to arrive with the Pixel Watch 4 next month. Although Google has already started putting screenshots of Pixel Weather on the Play Store for Wear OS. It's also unclear what will happen to the old Weather app once Pixel Weather rolls out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Its been rumored for a while that Samsung is looking to drop its base model in favor of the following lineup: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and the Galaxy S26 Ultra. It <em>seems </em>like these models are lined up in the tipster's photo in that order, meaning the S26 Edge is in for a major change.</p><p>The tipster alleges the device could see a raised, horizontal camera bar with two camera lenses. As the X post points out, the design is oddly similar to what's been theorized for Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 series.</p><p>The other two devices may continue the design cues we've seen from the Galaxy S25 series. However, as 9to5 states, Samsung might plan for a better Qi2 experience with this new flagship series. There's no getting around the fact that the S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">needs a case with the magnets</a> for its "Qi2 support" to work. All three leaked prototypes have a small indentation, which leaves the publication to wonder if this is a sign of more proper Qi2 support.</p><p>The tipster concludes things by alleging Samsung could launch the S26 series "in February."</p><h2 id="what-s-next-for-s26-2">What's next for S26?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s your first look at the Samsung Galaxy S26 dummies, Launching in February, and it looks like Samsung is going with a design very similar to the iPhone 17. pic.twitter.com/z581xHUxph<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1963563003993076135">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As previously stated, Samsung's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">rumored to shake up its next Galaxy S lineup</a>, something we heard about in July. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leak-shapes-the-galaxy-s26-pro-possible-small-screen-s25-successor">alleged in August</a> that the Galaxy S26 Pro could wind up being the successor to the smaller screen base model, like the S25. Early rumors claim the S26 Pro could rock a 6.2-inch display with a 4,300mAh battery.</p><p>The next Edge, on the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumor-galaxy-s26-edge-s26-pro-battery-specifications-alleged-increases">was rumored</a> to see a larger 4,200mAh battery, up from its current 3,900mAh capacity. Nothing was purported about any design changes, unlike what we're seeing today with the alleged dummy units. Another leak says the S26 Edge could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-leak-your-next-supercharged-phone-elite-2-rumored">your next superpowered phone</a>, as it's expected to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 (or 8 Elite Gen 5, whatever its name ends up being).</p><p>The device supposedly appeared in a performance test with Qualcomm's next flagship SoC, with a single-core score of 3,393 and 11,515 in its multi-core stage.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The screen still supports 3,000 nits of peak brightness and HDR10+ support — both of which are excellent for interested Edge 60 Neo buyers, as these are excellent for a phone that's this affordable.</p><p>Motorola improved the durability of the Edge 60 Neo this year, adding IP69 dust and water-resistance, which takes IP68 to the next level. IP69 adds protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water tests, meaning in theory, your Edge 60 Neo could survive a dishwasher run (don't do that). It's kind of a gimmick, but more durability is always welcomed. On that front, the display covering is now Gorilla Glass 7i, up from Gorilla Glass 3 on the Edge 50 Neo.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh" name="Motorola-Edge-60-Neo-8" alt="The Motorola Edge 60 Neo in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCDeWLEcyTQrPVFx9nyHfh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the list of upgrades is larger battery.

The display on both phones supports 600 nits of peak brightness, and it's paired with stereo Dolby Atmos speakers for audio.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sa2LP3JmZJ83CvMmkqtS7A" name="Motorola-Moto-G06-5" alt="The Motorola Moto G06 and G06 Power in the hand and on display at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa2LP3JmZJ83CvMmkqtS7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big separation between the Moto G06 and Moto G06 Power is, you guessed it, battery life. The regular Moto G06 has a respectable 5,200mAh battery capacity, but the Moto G06 Power elevates that further with a 7,000mAh capacity. Unfortunately, the Moto G06 Power only charges at 18W with a cable; luckily, you probably won't have to charge it very often.</p><p>We're still waiting to learn other key specs and availability details for the Motorola Edge 60 Neo, Moto G06, and Moto G06 Power, and we'll update this article when more information is available.</p> ]]></dc:content>
