Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

We're here to help you do just that!</p></div></div><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> is here, but what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>? Should you buy it?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-buy-a-tablet"><span>Why buy a tablet?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HF5TNkSTxxzmi7PHkFDGyT" name="google-pixel-tablet-photo-display-docked" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet showing a picture of a deep blue hydrangea, pulled from Google Photos while docked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HF5TNkSTxxzmi7PHkFDGyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some good reasons why you might want to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-gaming-tablets">tablet</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-refurbished-phonehttps://www.androidcentral.com/more-people-are-buying-usedrefurbished-phones-ever">. </a></p><p>Most of us think they're just a great big phone, and while that's not wrong, the form factor is a lot better for a handful of things like watching video, playing some games where you need that screen real estate, scrolling through social media on the couch, or even getting some work done. Yes, you can do real work with a good tablet.</p><p>Another reason is familiarity. One of the ways a tablet is a really big phone is that the software is almost the same. There will be changes to the look and feel to make it easier to use, but if you know how to do "everything" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> (for example), you know how to do the same on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-ipad-mini-seems-great-even-if-you-love-android">iPads</a> are much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone">iPhones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google's Pixel Tablet</a> is very similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>.</p><p>And that's where the value question comes in. If you decide you do want a tablet, or need to pick up a new one because you already use them, is the 2024 Pixel Tablet still worth buying, especially when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">it's on sale for $249 at Amazon</a>?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U" name="google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-controls" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet with a smart home controls widget on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Tablet does a pretty good job at most tablet tasks. YouTube or Netflix looks great on it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-game-streaming-seems-be-rolling-out-more-countries-ahead-schedule">streaming Xbox games</a> works without a hitch, and the work will get done if the software you need for your job is available for Android. There are a few extra reasons why you might want a Pixel Tablet, too.</p><p><strong>Of course, I have to say AI</strong>. For everything a Google Pixel lacks or doesn't do as well as the competition, when it comes to crunching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">Gemini's on-device AI</a>, they are the king. That's exactly what they were designed to do well, and this is something Google got right.</p><p><strong>There's also a fancy speaker dock</strong>. You can use it for charging, to display your screen's content, or to listen to music; it's a good little device if you want something like a Chromecast.</p><p><strong>When docked, it's like a Google Home Hub</strong>. If you are into smart home gear (guilty), Google Home is worth the frustration of setting up for a decent experience without any nerd wizardry like installing a special operating system. It's not perfect, even a year later, but it's the best ready-made consumer solution for this one.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few good reasons to buy a different tablet, too.</p><p><strong>It's a big Pixel phone</strong>. Everything that a Google Pixel phone isn't very good at doing, the Pixel Tablet will be the same way. For game streaming, it's great. For playing local games, it's not. This is just one example of Google's AI focus overshadowing performance in other areas. If you love a Pixel phone, you'll love the Pixel Tablet. The same goes if you don't like them ...</p><p><strong>Battery life can be hit or miss</strong>. Some people claim the battery life on their Pixel Tablet is great. Other people say it's terrible. It's not my tablet of choice, so I can't chime in here, but seeing this tells me that how long the battery lasts depends a lot on what you're trying to do with it. That's pretty standard, but I'm not seeing people with complaints who are trying to do anything crazy; it seems that sometimes, "normal use" is too much for the battery.</p><p><strong>There are (still) some weird bugs</strong>. After almost a year's worth of updates, the software - especially anything to do with the Hub functionality or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app - is glitchy and often hard to set up. If you're a Pixel phone fan, you understand; Google is always messing with its stuff when it comes to software.</p><p><strong>There are plenty of other good tablets to buy</strong>. I'm not big on tablets; I tend to use a Chromebook flipped in half instead. But I've been around enough to know that Amazon, Apple, and Samsung make products that fit a lot of people better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-vs-galaxy-tab-s7">Galaxy Tab S</a> line and Apple's iPad are little powerhouses that seem to be able to do anything, no matter how intensive, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Amazon's Fire Tablet</a> is hands-down the best tablet you can buy for streaming video. My wife buys a new Galaxy Tab S every other year, and she swears by it - even when compared to my iPad.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do you love Google's Pixel phones? Do you want to set up a docked music streamer that can also control your thermostat or lights? Do you use Google Gemini a lot?</p><p>If you answered yes to any of the above, it's a good deal. Google isn't bringing a new version any time soon, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank">Labor Day sale price of $249</a> is about the same as some of the other tablets that won't perform as well.</p><p>If you want a tablet to kick back on a lazy weekend and watch Disney+, get an Amazon Fire Tablet. They're really cheap - Amazon sells them at a loss to get you to buy into Prime - and they perform well enough when doing other things.</p><p>If you need power and productivity, look towards Apple or Samsung. You'll pay more (maybe a lot more), but in the long run you'll be glad you did.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="260c6e68-b8f8-4197-ad66-72e3b597e29e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet: $399" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet: $399" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:607px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.96%;"><img id="G663XmqXaRTPwDgSabeqQ6" name="google-pixel-tablet.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G663XmqXaRTPwDgSabeqQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="607" height="370" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Tablet: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galahttps://www.amazon.com/Google-Octa-core-Unlocked-T-Mobile-Obsidian/dp/B0DKG9C7RR/ref=dp_fod_d_sccl_3/145-8150528-5809421?tag=georiot-us-default-20&pd_rd_w=sZlOQ&content-id=amzn1.sym.9cf17164-13e4-4652-96f9-f76b8f33fec0&pf_rd_p=9cf17164-13e4-4652-96f9-f76b8f33fec0&pf_rd_r=45BJ77P760DH8J2WZX4B&pd_rd_wg=0FzS4&pd_rd_r=354d0d53-3c4d-4d93-a71c-ba358cb67a31&pd_rd_i=B0DKG88KXT&th=1&ascsubtag=ac-us-6662645875332848913-20&geniuslink=truexyhttps://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="260c6e68-b8f8-4197-ad66-72e3b597e29e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet: $399" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet: $399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del><strong> $249 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>A giant-sized Google Pixel phone, the Pixel Tablet has some other tricks up its sleeve, too.

I know just enough about high-capacity, high-density, small form-factor batteries to be a little dangerous, but that's enough to know Giin is correct.</p><p>Your phone battery will lose the ability to accept and hold a charge the minute it's installed inside the phone. If you move the needle to the ends of the scale when it comes to charging, it loses more.</p><p>As it loses more, the effect compounds, and you lose even more. Batteries are wonderful little things, but they are pretty piss-poor components <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">as far as longevity is concerned</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm guessing the idea behind capping the amount of charge a battery can accept is to slow down that extra degradation, and it's something that a lot of companies <em>allow</em> to happen. For us, the idea seems weird; charge over 80% of 80% and the battery still gets old. Batteries suck. We're not battery engineers or scientists. Well, most of us aren't.</p><p>I imagine someone at Google had the idea to enforce this rule instead of making it optional because they think it will make a difference in the longevity of the battery. You might need to charge an hour earlier for the first year, but in three years, you'll still be able to charge your phone. When you go on about how you support your product's software for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">seven years or more</a>, you have to try to make sure the hardware will last that long, too.</p><p>Will this work? I don't know. Should we like it? Again, I don't know. Is Google locking down the phones in a jail that makes even Apple sad? Maybe ...</p><p>What I do know is that a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of this "innovative" new feature — telling what the testing showed and why the company thinks it will help — would have prevented this whole thing.</p><h2 id="google-is-the-worst-when-it-comes-to-the-right-message-2">Google is the worst when it comes to the right message</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3118px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL" name="made-by-google-2025-magic-cue-demo" alt="Jimmy Fallon using Magic Cue on stage with a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJ8wDWo9Y7SYPoNqrvXkYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3118" height="1752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google sucks at a lot of things, but it sucks at explaining why it seems to do odd things the most. This is a classic example, but it's totally not the only example. Heck, it won't be the only example this month.</p><p>I couldn't tell you why this is, but I can guess, so I will: the disconnect between the people doing the work and the people doing the talking is too big. Public relations people are expected to tell folks what they need to hear about the good stuff and gloss over the bad stuff as quickly as possible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/scott_adams_126696" target="_blank">Author Scott Adams said</a>, "Good engineers solve problems. If there are no problems to be found, they end up creating them." That's true because there is always something to play with. Pixel phones are good phones if you don't mind putting up with Google's inevitable changing stuff around. Whenever everything works as it should, someone just has to touch it anyway.</p><p>When one group can't explain the shenanigans of the other, well, the message is going to be lost. Like Google forcing your brand-new phone to use less of its battery capacity. We all know Google had a reason, but Google didn't make it clear from the jump.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's the question Google probably tried to answer when developing Camera Coach. It's a software feature that uses AI to give you all the tips you need to take excellent photos with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Camera Coach is optional and requires off-device cloud processing. It won't be for everyone, but it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> series' flagship software features and is certainly worth a try. Whether you're using it once or every time, this guide will teach you how to use Camera Coach.</p><h2 id="what-is-camera-coach-2">What is Camera Coach?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Camera-Coach-1" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8qNdg3XS2SSrdP2ifBJXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up until now, Google's robust suite of generative AI photo editing features has handled modifying pictures <em>after</em> they've been captured. These include tools like Magic Editor, but these AI features are stuck working with the same source material. By comparison, Google's new Camera Coach feature for the Pixel 10 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> utilizes AI to provide instructions <em>before</em> the photo is captured.</p><p>Camera Coach is currently in preview, and the way it works is simple. When enabled, Google uses custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> models to scan what's in your viewfinder and provide tips to produce a better shot. These suggestions might include creative setup options or corrections for potential framing or lighting problems. These tips are specific to your situation, so it's sort of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/camera-coach-is-the-best-google-pixel-10-ai-feature">having a photography teacher in your back pocket</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that AI does scan your viewfinder, and the data does leave your device. Google explains that "when you use Camera Coach, the contents of the scene will be sent to Google for processing and then deleted." Don't share anything private with Camera Coach for this reason.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-camera-coach-on-the-pixel-10-2">How to use Camera Coach on the Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i" name="google-pixel-10-blue-camera-coach-01" alt="Using Camera Coach on a blue Google Pixel 10 to take a picture of a potted plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCBzuZt2iV29kzuCjxtM4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Activating the Camera Coach feature is easy, as it's found right above the viewfinder in the Pixel Camera app. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1.

It takes a bit for your viewfinder's contents to leave your device, get processed, and come back. For quick shots, you'll want to use your own judgment so as not to miss the action. However, you might want to use Camera Coach for intricate setups and quests to get the <em>perfect</em> Pixel 10 photo.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="897fc163-4c55-43f8-aa81-24c499ebd6cd">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Pixel camera</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 packs the best camera we've seen in a base-model Pixel phone, with a triple-camera rear system for the first time.

This includes features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixelsnap</a>, which finally brings Qi2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users" target="_blank">MagSafe accessories</a> without requiring adapters or unique cases. Google also managed to incorporate a larger battery, claiming that the 10 Pro Fold can last up to 30 hours on a single charge.</p><p>Additionally, Google implemented these various improvements without increasing the price. The base model is still priced at $1,799 for 256GB of storage, and a 1TB option is now available if you want to turn the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-deals" target="_blank">10 Pro Fold</a> into a do-it-all phone.</p><h2 id="why-you-shouldn-t-buy-a-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">Why you shouldn't buy a Pixel 10 Pro Fold</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Mk2cfnRgShpCKVHFNpUbie" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-display-inner" alt="Comparing the displays on the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mk2cfnRgShpCKVHFNpUbie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's difficult to find too many flaws with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but there are a few frustrations and omissions. Most notable is the camera hardware, which doesn't use the same sensors as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, a phone that costs $800 less.</p><p>Google seems okay with leaving any improvements to the software, with on-device processing doing more of the heavy lifting compared to the non-foldable Pixel 10s. Of the three rear cameras, Google technically did upgrade the main wide-angle lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zMw4czny7P6bjcc6po833W" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-made-you-look-03" alt="Three new "Made You Look" animated camera features on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMw4czny7P6bjcc6po833W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it's only using a newer 48MP sensor, while the telephoto and ultrawide cameras remain unchanged. I have no doubt that it'll still take fantastic pictures, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> now sharing the same primary camera sensor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Google's decision is disappointing.</p><p>Lastly, $1800 for a foldable phone is still a tough pill to swallow. Especially when viewed from the perspective of the general consumer.</p><p>You walk into a store and see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, with its all-new and sleek design, upgraded cameras, and packed with features that you'll never even realize are there. Then, you look the other direction and see the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has a fresh coat of paint, but looks pretty similar to last year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-03" alt="Comparing the size and thickness of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (light blue), Honor Magic V5 (gold/copper), and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (dark blue)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LytDXXUSV3wFonhJRunbT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a $200 difference between the two, and in a vacuum, ignoring budget constraints, I'd have to guess that more people will reach for the Fold 7. Perhaps it would be different if Google even dropped the price by $100, narrowing its margins for a year, just to attract more people into the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Some understand the hidden costs that go into the creation of a smartphone. The rest either don't know or don't care and just see what looks like an iPhone-like release cycle with seemingly minimal upgrades.</p><h2 id="trying-to-decide-go-with-your-gut-2">Trying to decide?

Google says this is due to "supply chain issues," and while it will still arrive ahead of the 2025 holiday frenzy, that doesn't help those who want to upgrade now.</p><p>You can already walk into basically any carrier store or Best Buy and walk out with a Fold 7. Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/"><em>just</em> announced</a> its next event, presumably where the iPhone 17 series will be introduced, and there's a good chance it'll be released before the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, too.</p><p>That's to say, if you had your heart set on picking up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I'd say just wait out the FOMO storm. At least on paper, the improvements look to be well worth it, and if you were on the fence, there's nothing wrong with testing the Fold 7 waters to see how you like it. There's always a return window in case you change your mind.</p><p>Personally, I'm waiting until the 10 Pro Fold is released before using my personal upgrade.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold-render-Moonstone-tabletop" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,799</del><strong> $1,039 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro Fold shows anything, it's that Google is serious about the form factor, introducing just the right amount of upgrades over its predecessor to keep it in competition with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and other foldables. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

Both Honor and OnePlus have caught up to Google's motion capture fidelity and, at times, have surpassed Pixel cameras. Samsung has even put in considerable effort to address its long-standing issue with motion capture with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>For this motion test, my wife used a toy lure on our cat to get it to jump around the living room. I held two phones side by side and tapped the shutter button simultaneously. Each phone was allowed two shots, both of which can be viewed side by side in the photos below. This ensures they aren't cherry-picked or biased to the best of my abilities.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.36%;"><img id="fXTN4fvTEUnmWsxRsibBKB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-motion-01" alt="Comparing camera motion capture with photos of a cat, captured on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXTN4fvTEUnmWsxRsibBKB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.36%;"><img id="Vp3RpQo9DXz2UaTXeUg9NB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-samples-motion-01" alt="Comparing camera motion capture with photos of a cat, captured on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vp3RpQo9DXz2UaTXeUg9NB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.36%;"><img id="ZFVDkjC2m8ovW9nqoRLrQB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-camera-samples-motion-01" alt="Comparing camera motion capture with photos of a cat, captured on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFVDkjC2m8ovW9nqoRLrQB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3890px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.36%;"><img id="3EgfU49wThonoHik6kuuSB" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-honor-magic-7-pro-camera-samples-motion-01" alt="Comparing camera motion capture with photos of a cat, captured on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and an Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3EgfU49wThonoHik6kuuSB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3890" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The results were mostly unsurprising if you've followed our motion tests before. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> is the clear winner and handily beats the other phones. I'd say the Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> were a tie; while the Pixel 10's photos are slightly brighter, I prefer the texture on the Pixel 9 Pro's photos.</p><p>The comparison between the Pixel 10 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a little harder to judge. The Pixel 10's photos are brighter but softer than those of the OnePlus 13. The cat's fur appears clear in one shot on the OnePlus 13 and in the other shot on the Pixel 10 Pro. Maybe give the Pixel 10 Pro a very slight edge in this one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra test surprised me a lot. Typically, Pixels trounce Samsung's phones in any motion test, but that wasn't the case here. If anything, the Pixel 10 Pro is only marginally better in some parts of the photo, like the cat's face and slightly brighter shadow detail.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="WmEaKBZJVHmcKVJawTCwTN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-samples-main-01" alt="Comparing photos of a billiard room between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmEaKBZJVHmcKVJawTCwTN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="gJu7qnzr9AXmNgLnZN6dSN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-02" alt="Comparing photos of a shaded terrace with mountains in the background between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13 at 2x zoom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJu7qnzr9AXmNgLnZN6dSN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="WftAgUedzRUzNNYzZVSPhN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-03" alt="Comparing photos of colorful plants between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13 at 2x zoom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftAgUedzRUzNNYzZVSPhN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="zgF7vFZwqMnYyKGw4V8zwN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-samples-main-01" alt="Comparing photos of a starkly lit greenhouse between the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgF7vFZwqMnYyKGw4V8zwN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I also took the OnePlus 13, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL out for a photo shoot in and around the Biltmore House. At 1x and 2x zoom, the Pixel 10 Pro XL demonstrated a notable improvement in dynamic range compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>I've also found that the Pixel 10 Pro's photos have an excellent texture. Bricks, carpets, and other finely textured surfaces retain their detail much better on the Pixel 10 Pro than on the Pixel 9 Pro. The OnePlus 13 also does an exemplary job of this, while Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra tends to scrub away some of that fine detail, likely because Samsung's processing algorithm thinks it's camera noise.</p><h2 id="telephoto-and-ai-zoom-2">Telephoto and AI zoom</h2><p>One of the highlights of the Pixel 10 Pro series is the upgraded Pro Res Zoom, which finally competes with other premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">Android phones</a> by giving users the ability to zoom up to 100x with the camera. Since the telephoto lens on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro is the same, the enabling factor here is the new onboard diffusion model that runs completely on Tensor G5.</p><p>That means, by default, any photo that's zoomed in at 30x and beyond is automatically enhanced with an onboard AI algorithm. If you've learned anything about AI over the past few years, that means that results are either mind-blowing or head-scratching. Samples below are taken between 30x and 80x.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item"

I say "maybe" because while the picture of the gargoyle statue at 80x looks better on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, the texture you see on the statue is far too fine and uniform to be the actual texture of the object. The OnePlus 13 is closest to reality in that shot.</p><p>However, every other shot is essentially worse to some degree, primarily due to either a lack of detail or motion blur.

detection of the pack, which Samsung has excelled at for years. The OnePlus 13 often takes second place, although there are a few areas where the edge detection could use improvement, especially when capturing images of non-human subjects (like plants).</p><p>Meanwhile, Google appears to have perfected the look of a camera portrait on plants and other similar non-human subjects, giving the photo a gorgeous shift in focus that seems to have come from a lens. Human subject cutouts are markedly improved, although there's still fringing happening around many of the brightest edges and a few spots where it could be further cleaned up.</p><p>However, the Pixel's exposure and color accuracy are significantly better than Samsung's, which often appears too dark and fails to prioritize exposure on the subject. I generally find that I prefer the OnePlus 13's shots for people and the Pixel 10 Pro's shots for other subjects.</p><h2 id="ultrawide-and-macro-2">Ultrawide and macro</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

It still takes excellent macro shots and generally excellent ultrawide photos, as well. The software intelligently switches between the two focus modes depending on the distance of the object in the photo.</p><p>In general, the OnePlus 13 has the best ultrawide performance of the bunch, with the nicest colors and the widest dynamic range, and roughly the same amount of detail as the Pixel 10 Pro. However, it doesn't score as well with macro shots. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is often the worst of the bunch, but the results are usually not bad.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro performs quite well in macro shots and appears to be the best among the three. That, combined with the solid-looking ultrawide shots, gives it the overall edge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10"><span>Google Pixel 10</span></h2><p>My testing of the Pixel 10 was a bit more straightforward and with less Taylor Swift. I mainly focused on the Pixel 10 itself while also comparing shots with the Pixel 9, so we have an idea of how things have changed between generations.</p><p>The Pixel 10 may have the most upgraded camera system of the three phones, but it wouldn't seem that way on paper. That's because the resolution is downgraded on both the wide and ultrawide sensors from 50MP and 48MP to 48MP and 13MP, respectively. That said, photo quality hasn't degraded as a result; in fact, it might be a bit better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>, thanks to the help of the new Tensor G5 and the addition of a third 10MP telephoto camera.</p><h2 id="main-camera-and-portrait-2">Main camera and portrait</h2><p>Images with the primary 48MP camera are often crisp and detailed, and there's seemingly more contrast this time around, which helps the photos pop a little more. It also does well with movement, able to capture large crowds of people without turning them into blurry messes, and can even seemingly freeze water in a fountain.</p><div class="inlinegallery

One of the areas Samsung is trying to streamline is its link for "effortless" check-ins. Now, the person responsible for taking care of you (son, daughter, etc.) can send you a text message with a link to Family Care.</p><p>After receiving, the mother/father/grandparent can accept and agree to Samsung's standard consent options for health data gathering and more. Once that's complete, everything is set. Samsung states this streamlined approach should make it easier for those unfamiliar with using apps, as the steps required are quite minimal and straightforward.</p><p>The newest update also allows "families to define caregiver and care recipient roles more clearly." Through this, preferences on what you'd like to be kept in the loop about become clearer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.10%;"><img id="GgXfazhV6BvuBqqqnq4EeD" name="samsung-smartthings-family-care-activity-monitor" alt="Samsung SmartThings Family Care lets caregivers stay in the loop about their loved one's activity, such as using the TV and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgXfazhV6BvuBqqqnq4EeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Family Care is a part of SmartThings, so that means it's connected to other smart home appliances the care recipient has around them. Samsung says users can decide which appliances the caregiver would like to stay informed about. Say, your mother has a TV at home and she typically watches it in the afternoon for her shows.</p><p>If an appliance hasn't been used for a while, Family Care can send an alert to the caregiver. The alert will let the caregiver "respond immediately," via phone call or text. Family Care's update lets users fine-tune how long down periods should be and which appliances they'd like to remain informed about.</p><p>This is all wrapped under the recipient's "Activity" logs.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-staying-informed-2">Keeping track & Staying informed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.10%;"><img id="rRkRgGnkAT8MTGFwgDcu47" name="samsung-smartthings-family-care-medicine-food-schedule-alerts" alt="Samsung's Family Care lets caregivers set schedules and reminders about meals and medicine." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRkRgGnkAT8MTGFwgDcu47.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Staying connected with our loved ones is important, especially when we're responsible for their well-being. Family Care is bringing a familiar feature, alerts that inform you when your loved one has left or arrived at a cataloged location. Additionally, there's a map where you can see where they've gone and the path traveled.</p><p>Lastly, daily meals and medicine at certain times are crucial. The Family Care update lets users set up schedules and reminders of when they should eat and take their medicine, so sudden scares are (hopefully) avoided. These updates should be rolling out soon for Galaxy devices, so keep your eyes peeled.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The boldest example so far is Realme's new concept phone: it's surprisingly thin but holds an extremely huge battery.</p><p>At its recent 828 Fan Festival in China, Realme introduced two new concept smartphones. One of these devices features a huge 15,000mAh battery, which is claimed to allow users to watch 25 movies or play games for 30 hours on a single charge.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing realme's Game-Changing Concept Phones!

Realme's somehow sidestepped that entirely. The company squeezed a monster battery into a chassis that's just 8.89mm thick, making the typical tough phone look ancient by comparison.</p><p>According to Realme, its battery holds more power than all five iPhone models from the 12 to the 16 combined. It's also pitching it as a portable charger you can use to power up your other devices, like your smartwatch or a friend's phone, with a cable.</p><h2 id="a-total-marathoner-2">A total marathoner</h2><p>So what does that get you? Realme estimates about five days of regular use, enough video playback to binge for two straight days, or it could just sit in your bag on airplane mode for a quarter of a year.</p><p>The major limitation is that the 15,000mAh battery isn't feasible to mass-produce yet, as per leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Q1vysv6vR" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a>. However, Realme has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/realmeglobal/status/1958377736776687752" target="_blank">10,000mAh version</a> of this tech that may already be in production, making a real-world release far more likely.</p><h2 id="here-s-the-catch-2">Here's the catch</h2><p>For now, don't expect to buy this beast.

This one tackles a different problem: heat. It comes with an integrated cooling fan to keep performance smooth during heavy gaming, so your phone doesn't turn into a hotplate.</p><p>You can spot a vent on the phone's left side in the teaser image, most likely acting as an exhaust. According to the company's VP, this active cooling setup is powerful enough to cool the device by up to 6°C.</p><p>Realme threw everything at overheating with this concept. The cooling system is a three-part combo: a huge vapor chamber soaks up the heat, a tiny fan spins to dissipate it, and a thermoelectric cooler gives it that final chill push.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can, however, create a custom voice for Bixby using your own voice, but it doesn't sound as good as the preloaded voices for Gemini.</p></article></section><h2 id="does-the-voice-assistant-on-the-galaxy-s25-sound-natural-compared-to-gemini-2">Does the voice assistant on the Galaxy S25 sound natural compared to Gemini?</h2><p>It became clear with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> that Samsung is putting more of its focus on Gemini and less on Bixby. As a result, Gemini was the default voice assistant on the Galaxy S25, which users could activate by pressing and holding the power button. It's not surprising that Samsung has put Bixby on the back burner.</p><p>One of the reasons why Bixby continues to feel behind is that the voice assistant constantly reminds you that you're talking to AI. That's because it doesn't sound as natural as Google Assistant or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>. While you can choose between several voices, they all sound robotic, and conversations don't flow as naturally.</p><p>On the other hand, Gemini also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-change-geminis-voice-on-android">multiple voices to choose from</a>, and they all sound very realistic, as if you're talking to an actual person. This makes it easier to have naturally flowing conversations without feeling like you're talking to a computer. This is one of the perks of features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, which lets you have free-flowing conversations where you can interrupt the assistant in the middle of an answer, something I can't do with Bixby.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk" name="Gemini-Live-S25-Pixel-9" alt="Gemini Live on the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcR7JnGvLMXQrMQfZThmBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that Bixby has that Gemini doesn't is the ability to use your own voice as an option for the assistant, which you set up by reading a number of prompts to it. This allows it to capture your vocal intricacies and inflections. It works decently well, but it still sounds tinny and robotic.</p><p>Still, I prefer using Gemini over Bixby, and the voice is one of the reasons why Google's virtual assistant is generally better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The user states, "When i connect to my car, the phone is recognized but the screen remain grey with AA logo watermark."

Honor has introduced a new solution to this common problem with its latest flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Magic V5</a>.</p><p>Honor's new technology brings real-time, on-device translation to your device. What makes it different? Everything happens on the phone, eliminating the need for cloud solutions. That means better privacy, lower latency, and no internet dependency.</p><p>Two technical papers backing the tech were also accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025, a major conference on speech processing.</p><p>While some on-device translation has existed before, it often falls short in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory usage. Honor’s latest approach changes that, delivering cloud-level performance while keeping everything private and stored locally on your phone.</p><h2 id="tiny-memory-footprint-2">Tiny memory footprint</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2648px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:117.82%;"><img id="7vfLUvNVgUeG6X4DeEd3UX" name="Honor-Magic-V5-on-device-translation" alt="on-device translation on the Honor Magic V5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vfLUvNVgUeG6X4DeEd3UX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2648" height="3120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This leap forward comes from cracking tough problems in on-device multilingual speech recognition and translation.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles for on-device AI is memory use. Typical translation models can eat up 3–4GB of space. Honor says its solution slims that down to just 800MB, or a 75% reduction, while still packing support for six languages: Chinese, English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian.</p><p>That also means you aren’t downloading half a gigabyte per language.</p><h2 id="real-time-translations-that-actually-feel-real-time-2">Real-time translations that actually feel real-time</h2><p>But the real improvement is in how it works. Instead of waiting for you to finish a sentence before translating (the classic way), Honor's system processes speech in real time, almost like a simultaneous interpreter. The company claims this approach boosts inference speed by 38% and improves accuracy by 16%.</p><p>Under the hood, the system uses something called Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention, a streaming method that helps the AI predict and transcribe speech without significant delays. There’s also a Parasitic Dual-Scale Modeling technique, developed with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, that helps run large speech models efficiently on phones without compromising performance.</p><p>It’s a quiet but meaningful step toward making AI more useful and less obtrusive, especially when you’re trying to have a natural conversation across languages.</p> ]]></dc:content>

My phone ended up hitting the concrete floor hard, and since I use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Moto Razr</a>, I thought for sure it was a goner. Luckily, everything is all good, and I have a developer setting called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/all-about-your-phones-developer-options">USB Debugging</a> to thank for it.</p><p>Although it's a foldable and they're not nearly as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-will-foldable-phones-ever-be-durable">durable as a regular phone</a>, the Razr was fine, or so I thought. The screen was on and I saw what I expected to see there, but touching it didn't do much; it was really squirrelly when swiping, and no icons would open an app. After restarting, it did nothing. I called Motorola's support, expecting to be told to send it to them for a repair estimate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynYtFdSEWMPa2J4Mv3UqAV" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-9" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynYtFdSEWMPa2J4Mv3UqAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Long story short: I got on the line with one of those jewels of a representative who was certain he knew what was wrong and how we could fix it. I'm not sure how or why, but if the accelerometer and/or gyroscope aren't functioning properly, the display also isn't. Something to do with the way it switches when you close the phone. It's an easy fix, just enter a menu through the dialer and "reset" them.</p><p>Except I couldn't use the screen. How in the world could I get the dialer open if tapping the phone icon did nothing? With a cable and a command, that's how:</p><p><em><strong>adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.DIAL -d tel:*#*#2486#*#*</strong></em></p><p>From there, Lupe, the tech wizard, walked me through and got everything working. I didn't have to pay for repairs or buy a new phone this time, simply because I had already set up something called ADB over the USB connection so my phone could "talk" with my computer.</p><h2 id="what-is-usb-debugging-and-should-you-enable-it-2">What is USB debugging and should you enable it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="buui44xq5YsjNTkZJ4h5Qh" name="android-bootloader.jpg" alt="adb reboot bootloader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/buui44xq5YsjNTkZJ4h5Qh.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>USB Debugging is the term Android uses for communication between a phone and a computer via a cable. It involves a driver of some flavor on the computer, and you need to enable developer tools on your phone and set it up.

You can only communicate with devices you've authorized, either permanently or on a one-time basis. You need to do this for <strong>every</strong> computer you plan to communicate with. Until you give that authorization, nothing can be sent or received.</p><p>That's how things are <em>supposed</em> to work, but we all know software comes with plenty of bugs and built-in exploits. Let's say one of these is made public. What are the real risks?</p><p><strong>Everything</strong>. You're risking every piece of data on your phone or account, just like you would if you installed some sort of malware. If I can open the phone dialer because my computer is connected to my phone, I can also open things like email to reset a password, a bank app, or any other app.</p><p>Once your phone is in someone else's hands, all bets are off anyway, but this also means that every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/why-its-important-to-charge-your-phone-the-right-way-when-youre-on-the-road" target="_blank">USB charging port at the airport or bus station is now off-limits</a>, too. I have seen an airport charging kiosk being torn apart in Oakland because someone popped a Raspberry Pi-like mini computer inside it that would attempt to pull data from your phone when you plugged it in. It was cool to see, but terrible that it was there.

However, my limited testing with the Hozo NeoRuler showed that Vivo's X Fold 5 is 1mm thinner, and the Z Fold 7 is 2mm thinner than the Magic V5. Honor's caveat is that the claim was made when the Magic V5 debuted in China in July, and given that the Z Fold 7 didn't launch until later in the month, it's continuing to use the claim in its marketing materials.</p><p>Regardless of the dubious proclamations around thinness, what's evident is that the Magic V5 is just as sleek as its immediate rivals. It feels like a regular phone when folded, and you get a decent 7.95-inch panel when unfolded. I like the design at the back; the gold variant looks exquisite, and the patterned design around the hinge makes the device look rather striking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iuUzeduJuhrShxxkfsGtk4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuUzeduJuhrShxxkfsGtk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Z Fold 7 also has decent presence, but the bold styling with the camera housing gives the Magic V5 an edge in this regard.

It's great to be able to read books on the inner panel, and this is a feature I enjoy quite a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VBRZiXv7rPr4HQD9c6Wz65" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBRZiXv7rPr4HQD9c6Wz65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor also leads the industry with eye-care solutions, and the Magic V5 has a slew of offerings in this area; there's defocus eyecare, natural tone, hardware-assisted blue light protection, and a new toggle to adjust the level of PWM dimming. Both panels on the Magic V5 get 4,320Hz PWM dimming, and you can switch between that mode and 3,840Hz. This is where the Magic V5 has a clear advantage over Google and Samsung; the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 don't have this feature.</p><p>Gaming is enjoyable on the inner panel, and the built-in audio is quite decent.

That said, there's no way to pin the taskbar — unlike other foldables — and Honor really needs to add a toggle to enable this.</p><p>What Honor does well is on-device AI; it has several tools aimed at image and video editing, real-time call translation, audio-to-text transcribing, and others that are highly useful. Honor collaborates heavily with Google in this area, and the results are much better than what you get on other Chinese phones — if anything, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a better AI suite.</p><p>The Magic V5 will get seven years of Android OS updates and security patches, just like Google's Pixel series and Samsung's Galaxy Z devices. This is great to see, and even though one update is wasted on bringing the device to Android 16 — what it should have launched with — but it will be relevant well into 2030.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v5-the-competition"><span>Honor Magic V5: The competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="xfZ9SCzgHpd553j2sYaWt4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfZ9SCzgHpd553j2sYaWt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo's X Fold 5 continues to be one of my favorite foldables of 2025, and although it doesn't differ too much to its predecessor, it combines a set of great cameras with useful software features and the best battery life of any device in this category. The hardware is a bit of a limitation as you don't get the latest silicon, but I didn't see any problems whatsoever. While it isn't available outside Asia, it's a good alternative to Samsung if you're in the region.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is also a decent choice if you're used to Samsung's software. The foldable has a thinner design, but the cameras aren't as good as the Magic V5, and the battery doesn't last anywhere as long.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v5-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Magic V5: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CwD3D3ApkkF8kec4p5JYu4" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CwD3D3ApkkF8kec4p5JYu4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want a stylish foldable</li><li>You need useful AI features</li><li>You want powerful internals</li><li>You need a foldable with amazing battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best software</li><li>You need Android 16 out of the box</li></ul><p>Having used the Magic V5 alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Vivo X Fold 5, it's clear that Honor nailed the brief this year. The Magic V5 holds its own against its immediate rivals, and it is just as sleek to hold and use. The absurdly-sized camera module tends to be a little annoying, but it's worth the inconvenience when you see just how good the cameras are on the device.</p><p>Honor has a definite edge over Samsung in key areas: the cameras are undoubtedly better than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the Magic V5 has much better battery life, and the OLED panels are brighter and have meaningful eye protection features.</p><p>The downside is that the MagicOS software still isn't quite as good as what you get on Samsung and Vivo foldables, and Honor really needs to overhaul the visuals and modernize the UI. That's not to say that the software is unusable; you get plenty of decent AI features and extensive customizability,  it's just that the interface needs polish.</p><p>With other Chinese brands limiting their foldables to Asia, the Magic V5 is the sole contender to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in vital western markets, and the fact that Honor is once again willing to undercut Samsung makes the Magic V5 even more enticing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, just because two phones measure the same on paper, this does not mean that you can use phone cases designed for either model on the other device.</p><p>Smartphone manufacturers often make changes to the design of their phones, even if the size remains the same as the previous iteration. For example, the placement of the power button or volume button might change. In some instances, the speaker grills change positions. A change in the style and size of camera lenses or camera bars is also a common occurrence.</p><p>Sometimes, even when the stars seem to align, the slightest shifts in design can make a significant difference. This is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8mm x 72mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>204g</p></td><td  ><p>198g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see from the table above, the on-paper measurements of the two Pixels are almost exactly the same. Going off of just the specs, you would think that the Google Pixel 10 can fit Pixel 9 cases. However, this is not the case.</p><p>Google changed the size of the camera island with the Pixel 10, so the shape and length don't match the Pixel 9. The speaker, grills, mic, and USB-C port are also misaligned with the last-gen Pixel. Thus, even if you manage to fit a soft Pixel 9 case on your Pixel 10, you'll end up covering the speaker and getting a poor fit. Hard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 cases</a> won't fit the Pixel 10 at all.</p><p>Even if you manage to fit a flexible silicone or TPU case designed for the Pixel 9 on your Pixel 10, it isn't a good idea to do so. Since the case is designed to add protection to the Pixel 9, it will not provide the same level of impact absorption or drop-proofing to your Pixel 10. It's simply not worth the risk. Please buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">Google Pixel 10 case</a> instead.

Those interested can watch from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung Newsroom</a>, Samsung.com, or the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>While we may have an idea about what's to come, the company only teases that you'll see "new" Galaxy devices. However, Samsung states consumers can now reserve its latest Galaxy Tab, the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite, and receive a $50 credit offer for other purchases.</p><p>Keep in mind that this reservation opportunity lasts until September 3, and purchases with the credit must be made between September 4 and October 5.</p><h2 id="a-new-galaxy-is-coming-2">A new Galaxy is coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU" name="samsung-virtual-unpacked-event-septermber-2025" alt="A Samsung Virtual Unpacked teaser, preparing users for a September 4 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rwfcrNsHJgs68ckMDk4xU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="822" height="462" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So far, we've had official launches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pack-ai-smarts-and-strong-anc">Galaxy Buds 3 FE</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-lite-september-launch-confirmed">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite</a>.

A more recent report claims that a launch for the S25 FE could happen sooner than we think, perhaps in September, after this newly revealed event. More than that, we have the expected Galaxy Tab S11 series, which could also stand in the spotlight early next month.</p><p>There was a report after Samsung's July Unpacked from an executive that stated the Galaxy Tab S11 series would launch "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">shortly after</a>." It left speculation to believe that we'd see it either in August or September, more so toward the latter, as that would line up with the S10 series in 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Moreover, Spotify says its messaging service should be used for sharing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. If someone sends you something "that doesn't feel right," you can report them by long-pressing their text. Users can block others or disable Messages altogether via Spotify's settings.</p><p>Spotify adds that its Messages are encrypted using industry standards when "in transit and at rest."</p><p>The platform's Jam feature recently got an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/spotify-jam-arrives-on-android-auto-via-an-update">upgraded experience for drivers</a> with Android Auto. Now, multiple users can contribute to the Jam, placing their music suggestions in a queue while on the road. Guests (riders) can join the driver's Jam session in the car by scanning the QR code present on their vehicle's display.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Beginning with the former, Google states Translate now offers a new "language practice" feature, which pushes the app to develop "tailored listening and speaking" practice sessions.</p><p>When using Translate, the post states users need only tap "practice" to get going. Initially, the app will ask you what you believe your current "level" is for any given language. Users will find options like Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Google says the practices Translate delivers will be generated "on-the-fly," but they will "adapt" to you the better you get.</p><p>Users will be asked about their goal for learning a language they're interested in before getting into the practice session. Google states practices will be in one of two ways: listening or speaking. If you're listening, you will have to tap the words you recognize from the AI-read statement. Speaking is pretty straightforward, as you'll have to say aloud what's in front of you—hints are there, too, just in case.</p><p>Google states this customized learning is rolling out in beta for the Translate app on Android and iOS this week.</p><h2 id="google-translate-meets-gemini-2">Google Translate meets Gemini</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xfhC9EmAJ8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The Translate app's real-time translations are being upgraded this patch, as Google credits its latest AI models for the improvement. Rolling out this week, users can tap "live translate," select the appropriate languages, and begin speaking. After you're done, the app will display what it's translated as it speaks it aloud for you.</p><p>Moreover, the AI models aid the Translate app in "intelligently" switching between the languages spoken by two parties (i.e., English and Spanish).</p><p>These enhanced live translate capabilities should begin appearing today (Aug 27) for users in the U.S., Mexico, and India. As it arrives, Google highlights its work to improve the quality and speed of the app's translations.</p><p>Gemini's intelligence continues to spread across Google's app ecosystem, but the AI model received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">a major boost yesterday</a> (Aug 25) for photo editing. Using Google DeepMind's latest software as leverage, Gemini's built-in editor for photos takes off using your prompts. Google states its editor is designed to keep the people and subjects looking like themselves when changing their outfits, backgrounds, and when blending images.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication reports that while Project Hypernova is expected to sport a display on its lens, Meta is "setting low expectations for sales." The post by UploadVR quoted TF International Securities analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1960513106704277658">Ming-Chi Kuo on X</a>, who stated that the Hypernova glasses may enter mass production in Q3 2025.</p><p>Meta is supposedly projecting to sell anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 units over two years.</p><p>Both CNBC and Ming-Chi Kuo highlight Meta's concerns, which the former states revolve around Hypernova's requirement of "more components" and its "slightly heavier and thicker" build. The projections on X suggest that AI is the "selling point" of these new glasses; however, applying such software to an AR device "is still in its nascent stages."</p><p>The analyst presumes that Meta could treat these Hypernova glasses more like an experimental product once it hits the market than a true device to really hook consumers.</p><h2 id="still-looking-ahead-2">Still looking ahead?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Mid-August held <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-next-gen-smart-glasses-could-land-next-month-for-less-cash-than-youd-think">some interesting estimations</a> about how much Meta could charge for its Hypernova glasses. Projections pit the device at around $800, potentially signaling that Meta is looking to go "mainstream" and not just for those eyeing the high-end segment of the market. It was also alleged that Meta was originally thinking of pricing the glasses at $1,000 or higher, but taking into account Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro (and low consumer interest) probably encouraged the company to knock that price down.</p><p>That same report claimed that Meta could be gearing up for a September launch.</p><p>Interest in Project Hypernova has only increased after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">a few alleged renders leaked</a> via social media in July. While the glasses look similar in design to the Ray-Ban smart glasses, the images suggest a thicker build, which echoes what we're hearing in August. Those leaks also held a glimpse of what Meta's sEMG bracelet could look like.</p><p>This bracelet has been playtested by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich, who stated that the sEMG add-on is quite necessary for the glasses. In short, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

For the first time since the device was announced in late July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F7JZYWLL/"><strong>Amazon is carving a straight $300 off the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</strong></a> No trade-in necessary, no confusing eligibility requirements to worry about: just good old-fashioned savings on a cutting-edge foldable phone. </p><p>This Labor Day deal is most likely happening because Google is set to release its own new foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, in October. But hey, a little friendly competition never hurt anyone, right? </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="06ed9f0a-2758-41be-91ea-c831507adbb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,999.99" data-dimension48="$1,999.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F7JZYWLL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-official-render-bg-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F7JZYWLL/" data-dimension112="06ed9f0a-2758-41be-91ea-c831507adbb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,999.99" data-dimension48="$1,999.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,999.99</del> <strong>$1,699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 just hit store shelves on July 25th, but you can already grab the premium foldable from Amazon and score a whopping $300 discount. No trade-in is required, although the retailer <em>is</em> offering a gift card worth up to $725 if you decide to send in an old or broken phone. With a device this expensive, every penny counts!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F7JZYWLL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="06ed9f0a-2758-41be-91ea-c831507adbb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,999.99" data-dimension48="$1,999.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> with a thin, lightweight design and excellent performance; you're a big fan of Samsung devices and you don't mind paying a premium for them. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a small phone or something affordable; you need a phone with incredible battery life or S Pen compatibility. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> proves that you don't need to sacrifice performance to get an ultra-thin, lightweight foldable. The device is basically a powerful smartphone and Android tablet all rolled into one, coming complete with the incredible Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and the same camera tech that's used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. </p><p>The folding hinge is also better than ever, with a nearly-invisible crease and two of the best AMOLED displays we've ever seen. The Z Fold 7 also comes with all of the latest AI features from Samsung, plus seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3753px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3753" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the lightweight build means that the Z Fold 7 had to sacrifice some battery life, but our testing showed that the phone will still last up to 20 hours before it needs more juice. Still, if you need a smartphone that's going to last over a day on a single charge, I might look elsewhere. The Z Fold 7 only has IP48 water/dust protection, which could be a problem if you like to take your phone into more rugged environments.</p><p>Indeed, the elephant in the room is that most foldable enthusiasts will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">choosing between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and the decision isn't easy. The Z Fold 7 has the lightweight design and powerful processor, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold boasts IP68 protection and increased battery capacity. Will this $300 Labor Day discount tip the scales for Samsung? It's a tough call, but if you're into foldable phones, you can't go wrong either way. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a04ed6d8-32eb-4076-9ad4-8e506cf59fbc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold-render-Jade-tabletop" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" data-dimension112="a04ed6d8-32eb-4076-9ad4-8e506cf59fbc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold 256GB: $1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension25=""><strong>$1,799, plus free $350 gift card at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Although it doesn't officially hit store shelves until October 9th, it's already apparent that the Z Fold 7 has a serious rival in the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.

Both Derrek and I didn't have the feature for the first few days, and it looks like Tom Pritchard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review-a-great-phone-but-it-doesnt-feel-like-much-of-an-upgrade">from Toms Guide</a> had the same issue. But while our Magic Cue spun up quite nicely and was making suggested actions appear all over the place, Pritchard didn't have the same experience.</p><p>This makes us wonder what people are going to see on their retail units when they collect them tomorrow. Will Magic Cue start working as expected after the 24-hour processing window Google warns about when enabling it, or is this a feature Google will need to iron out for the next few weeks and months?</p><p>Magic Cue should be grabbing information from all kinds of sources and privately disseminating it in appropriate apps, something that certainly feels great when it works, but is frustrating when it doesn't appear, yet you expect it to!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-spigen-magsafe-ring" alt="The jade Google Pixel 10 Pro with a Spigen MagSafe ring attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyVTFzWUFY5fwxCJLQbsp8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 series might look basically identical to the Pixel 9, but there's something important hiding underneath: Pixelsnap.

But not TechRadar's Philip Berne, who said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-review">in his review</a> that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL will be my primary device this year, for sure."</p><p>Berne says the primary reason for this is that the "Pixel 10 Pro XL is polished and well-built, with a refined look and gorgeous materials and color combinations." I agree that it's well-built, but I think Google could do a lot more to make the phone look more unique than an iPhone with a camera bar on the back — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">which is what it looks like right now</a>, let's not kid ourselves.</p><p>Regardless, Berne thinks "it’s a much nicer-looking phone than the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, and it delivers on a number of features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> hasn’t been able to match." That second part is mostly indisputable, as Apple Intelligence was a cluster of a rollout for Apple and Google nailed most of the new AI-based features in the Pixel 10 series out of the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-pixelsnap-ring-04" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVCNRdJmRYDqgJXAXxVp5G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the only downsides to Google adding Pixelsnap magnets inside the Pixel 10 series is that reverse wireless charging had to be sacrificed. This option was also known as Battery Share and could wirelessly charge devices like headphones or even <em>other phones</em> at a slow rate. It was an emergency power bank, in other words.</p><p>But as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-xl-review-redefining-the-smart-in-smartphone-170031073.html">Engadget's Sam Rutherford says</a>, "the Pixel 10 family no longer supports reverse wireless powersharing (aka Battery Share)." I can't say I miss the feature as I've never once used it in all my years of reviewing Android phones, but Rutherford laments the missing feature by noting that "every now and then I would find myself with a gadget that needed some juice, and even if it was slow, it was really nice to be able to bestow some excess energy upon a device without a cable."</p><p>Just goes to show you that even the "niche" features considered for the chopping block have their fans.

Privacy might sound a bit like an oxymoron when placed next to Google, but Pixels were built for privacy-first, and the Pixel 10 series furthers that goal with huge improvements to AI processing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/766613/google-pixel-10-pro-review-ai-magic-cue-camera-pro-res-zoom">The Verge's Allison Johnson</a> mentioned this in her review as one of the highlights of the new phones. "Magic Cue, for example, runs in the background <em>on device</em>. A camera feature...runs a diffusion model <em>on device</em>. Same with the phone call translator that mimics the sound of your voice. It’s more than just an impressive list; running these entirely on the phone means your data is much more private than if it had taken a trip to the cloud."</p><p>That's a huge deal in a world where most companies try to sell you big AI features but often asterisk them with "internet connectivity needed" for it to work. Pixel's approach not only ensures you never need a subscription to get the phone's best AI features, but that your data doesn't leave your phone to get them.

Tensor is all about AI processing, and that's one of the things that makes the Pixel 10 series special.</p><p>One of those magical things is Voice Translate, a new feature that builds upon previous text translation features. This time, Tensor can real-time translate your voice into another language while on a call, something the person on the other end will no doubt appreciate if they don't speak your native language very well (or at all).</p><p>Derrek Lee noted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review#section-google-pixel-10-software-and-ai">in our Pixel 10 review</a> that "Voice Translate continues to impress me, allowing others to hear my actual voice speaking another language while I'm actually speaking English.

Reading the feature's description reveals that it uses "generative AI" and cloud processing, which might sound scary for photography purists. However, taking a closer look at Camera Coach reveals it's more about empowering Pixel 10 users to take better photos than using AI to make its own edits.</p><p>After sharing your camera viewfinder with Camera Coach (which is optional, by the way), it uses custom Gemini models to give you photography tips specific to your situation. Camera Coach might recommend you adjust the framing or lighting of the shot to get a better result. It might even give you setup ideas based on the scene. This is all happening with off-device AI, but it's deleted when you're done.</p><p>I'm particularly excited about Camera Coach, not because it can be used as a crutch, but because it could serve as a launchpad for people who want to learn core photography skills and don't know where to start.

That should provide extra layers of security and privacy than cloud processing, which offloads your data to Google servers. Still, that might not be enough for some people, leading them to avoid enabling Magic Cue for privacy reasons.</p><p>Which camp do you fall in? Do you see Magic Cue as a helpful AI feature with privacy in mind, or a liability for your data?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z6jbmtCNeiWEPF6xd63yUh" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-34" alt="Pixel 10 eSIM transfer failure message" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z6jbmtCNeiWEPF6xd63yUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following in Apple's footsteps, Google decided to make the Pixel 10 series eSIM-only in the U.S. this year, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> — which isn't available yet but will be the <strong>only</strong> model to sport a physical SIM tray.</p><p>Is it a positive or negative change? As tech reviewers that need to constantly move SIMs around, we're a bit biased toward the simplicity of physical SIM cards. All you need is a SIM-eject tool (or a paperclip) and you can transfer a line between devices using a physical SIM. However, there are benefits to eSIM, like increased security in the event your phone is lost or stolen.</p><p>Our own Nicholas Sutrich, who reviewed the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, wrote "while eSIM may be fine for some people, I have no interest in switching away from a physical SIM card." Derrek Lee tested the base Pixel 10, and after an initial eSIM failure during the setup process, called the experience "streamlined." Now, it's up to you to decide whether you can live with eSIM on the Pixel 10 lineup.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3671px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-21" alt="The Pixel 10 lying flat on a marble surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3oJVCUBw6s2H6oRXF7Mv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3671" height="2065" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do you really need a Google Pixel 10 series device, or would a budget phone like the Google Pixel 9a suffice? That's the question 9to5Google editor-in-chief Abner Li ponders in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/27/google-pixel-10-pro-review/" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10 Pro initial review</a>. Li says he's been using a Pixel 9a for four months, explaining that some flagship phone features are luxuries rather than necessities.</p><p>"In going back to a (Pixel 10) Pro this past week, the hardware upgrades are noticeable and nice, but not mandatory," Li writes. "It’s akin to buying the luxury option."</p><p>We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">gave the Pixel 9a 4.5/5 stars in our own review</a> of the midrange handset, so we aren't exactly surprised. The cheapest new Pixel even has a few advantages over the Pixel 10, like a physical SIM tray, long battery life, and no bulky camera bar. Could you give up a flagship Pixel for a budget model this year?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3998px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-hero-1" alt="Holding the Pixel 10 outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3998" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of talk about the Google Pixel 10's rear camera setup, with some calling it a downgrade from the Pixel 9. Let's clear the air — while the Pixel 10's main sensor does have fewer megapixels than the Pixel 9's primary shooter, this change was made to fit a third telephoto camera on the back. Megapixels aren't everything when it comes to smartphone photography, so the shift from a 50MP to a 48MP main lens shouldn't concern you.</p><p>In fact, as we've already covered, the addition of a 5x zoom lens on the base-model Pixel 10 is actually an upgrade that brings the phone in line with competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p><p>When Google made a similar main camera shift on the Pixel 9a earlier this year, we found that the change actually resulted in better color accuracy and produced ideal results. The same seems to be true of the Pixel 10 with its new camera system, as our reviewer Derrek Lee calls the colors "pretty true to life." Additionally, the Pixel 10 series has the Tensor G5 chip with an all-new image-signal processor (ISP), further improving camera performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a" name="Pixel-10-all-devices" alt="Pixel 10 series - all devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year, there are more similarities between the three Google Pixel 10 models than ever. Notably, they're all powered by the Tensor G5 mobile platform and feature three rear cameras. To the untrained eye, it might be difficult to notice that there are just as many differences between the three models, and you won't want to pick the wrong one.</p><p>For starters, the base-model Pixel 10 only gets Wi-Fi 6E support, rather than Wi-Fi 7 on the Pro models and even the older Pixel 9. That might not be a problem today, but it could loom large a few years from now as people move to more advanced networking hardware. Additionally, the 128GB version of the Pixel 10 uses UFS 3.1 for storage as opposed to the newer UFS 4.0 on the 256GB variant.</p><p>To top it off, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the only model to get Qi2.2 support for 25W fast wireless charging support. The other models are limited to Qi2 15W, which is good but not great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I (Brady Snyder, AC Contributor) just invested in the Samsung ecosystem, purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy Watch 8, so I won't be getting a Google Pixel 10.

Compared to phones like the OnePlus 13, this thing takes an eternity to charge.</p><p>The new Pixelsnap Charger supports the new Qi2.2 standard on the Pixel 10 Pro XL only, enabling 25W wireless charging. It's the first phone to support the standard, and it even capped out at 28.3W, according to my measurement devices.

That means your battery will have a forced lower capacity in roughly a year of usage.

It's a feature that takes a few days to kick in, but when it does, it's worth the wait. Magic Cue is essentially a superpowered version of that nifty feature that gives you automatic replies to messages.</p><p>If someone mentions an event in a message, a new "chip" button will appear at the bottom of the screen that automatically adds it to your calendar. Emails related to phone calls will appear in the dialer, like doctor's appointment reminders or airline details. It even stealth powers some of the other new features, like Daily Hub.</p><p>Voice Translate real-time translates your voice into another language while on a call.

Google said Pixel Watches <em>are</em> its "next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit" and that Fitbit hardware would focus on "minimalistic, long-lasting trackers" like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Inspire 3</a> moving forward.</p><p>You can still buy the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> and feed Fitbit's new AI with HR, sleep, stress, and cardio load data. A Google spokesperson told me that the newest and best Fitbits "give the personal health coach the most information to work with."</p><p>However, the spokesperson wouldn't comment on whether these old Fitbits would provide the "full" coaching experience.

I know they'd enjoy talking to a "smarter Siri" about losing weight or beginner workout routines, but they wouldn't buy a new phone or a tiny Fitbit Inspire band to try it, nor trade a week of battery life away for apps.</p><p>Likewise, most of my local running club members wear dedicated fitness watches that prioritize longevity. The Pixel Watch 4 might work for runners because its speedy charging could top off the used battery while they shower, but I don't know how many of them will be willing to lose that comforting battery buffer.</p><p>If Google sold a Fitbit Sense 3 or Versa 5 that got the Watch 4's new health sensors, better GPS accuracy, and satellite SOS paired with a week of battery life, both casual and serious athletes would trade away the other Pixel Watch 4 perks for that. Google would get a lot more Fitbit Premium subscribers, both Android and iOS.</p><p>Since that's unlikely to happen, we'll see if Google's Pixel exclusivity gambit pays off and more athletes switch to Pixel phones for these AI coaching insights.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And depending on whether you pay $100 extra for grade 5 titanium or get the 316L stainless steel option, the Race 2 weighs 4g or 8g less than its predecessor.</p><div ><table><caption>Suunto Race 2 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Suunto Race 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>49 x 49 x 13.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight with silicone strap</p></td><td  ><p>75g (stainless steel) or 65g (titanium)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>10ATM, sapphire glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED (466x466), 2,000 nits, 60Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>16 days, 55 dual-band GPS hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Key training tools</p></td><td  ><p>SuuntoPlus apps, offline maps, climb guidance, interval workouts, training stress score, cumulative training load, recovery time, 115+ sport modes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$499 (steel) / $599 (titanium)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WCRUZinjfWQkv3BBxsjpTA" name="Suunto-Race-2-press-photo-1" alt="Photo of the Suunto Race 2 running watch on a person's wrist, their fingers primed to press a button to select a Trail Running activity on the watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCRUZinjfWQkv3BBxsjpTA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Suunto)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Suunto Race 2 is rated to last 16 days with continuous HR, stress, and sleep data, or up to 55 hours with dual-band GNSS tracking. While most "normal" athletes would never need this level of tracking, it ensures the Race 2 can last for 200km trail running events or multi-day hiking excursions without ever needing to worry about charging it.</p><p>For comparison, many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> fall into the same two-week span for "normal" use, but an hour of dual-band GPS usually has twice the impact or more on battery life.</p><p>Like many of our favorites, the Suunto Race 2 will judge the Training Stress Score (TSS) for each workout on your body in order to calculate your cumulative training load; it then judges whether you're slacking, improving, or overtraining as an athlete. It also calculates your post-workout Recovery Score so you know how long to rest.</p><p>The Race 2 also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.suunto.com/pages/suunto-plus">"SuuntoPlus" apps</a> that pair the watch with third-party running accessories and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training tools</a> like TrainingPeaks.

The company has announced the new Chipolo Card and Chipolo Loop, aiming to solve one of the big problems with item trackers.</p><p>While devices like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a> and Samsung Galaxy SmartTag+ bring an Apple AirTag-like experience to Android with UWB support, one of the main issues with such devices is that they come with a replaceable battery, which, while convenient for some, is still a hassle for others. Chipolo's new trackers aim to solve this with rechargeable batteries.</p><p>Chipolo Loop features a modern circular design with a built-in loop, making it easy to attach to keys or bags, while the Card offers a credit card-like design for wallets. Both Loop and Card offer IP67 water and dust protection, and Chipolo says both trackers are "adventure-proof."</p><h2 id="chipolo-card-supports-qi-wireless-charging-while-loop-uses-a-usb-c-port-2">Chipolo Card supports Qi wireless charging, while Loop uses a USB-C port</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4qMzGYre33JKt7NkcUGxLd" name="chipolo-loop-usb-c" alt="Chipolo Loop with USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qMzGYre33JKt7NkcUGxLd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2CypoScKFhmP9o2CB6SBd" name="chipolo-card-new" alt="Chipolo's new Card in a wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2CypoScKFhmP9o2CB6SBd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Chipolo Loop is available in six colors: navy, mint, honey, coral, charcoal, and chalk, while the Card only comes in charcoal.

While the company hasn't explicitly claimed the tracker has a magnetic ring, it does say the Card automatically aligns to the center of the charger. In terms of battery life, the company claims both Loop and Card provide up to 6 months of battery life per charge.</p><p>Both Loop and Card have a Bluetooth range of up to 120m and improved loud sounds for easier tracking. They're compatible with both Android and iOS, working with Apple's Find My and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google's Find Hub</a> so you can track essentials directly from the pre-installed app. You can also pair them with the Chipolo companion app for some extra features like Call Your Phone, out-of-range alerts, and adjustable volume.</p><p>Both Chipolo Card and Loop are priced at €45/$39/£39 and are available for pre-order starting today from Chipolo's website and Amazon. They'll also be available at T-Mobile stores and other retailers starting late September 2025.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Chipolo/page/B8E7D8A8-5BE4-4BC9-B226-8931CC54797D">Pre-order at Chipolo (Amazon)</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the core Gemini CLI experience is no longer limited to the text-based, command-line format. Gemini CLI expands to the integrated development environment (IDE) starting today, Aug. 28, as it is now natively available in Zed's multiplayer code editor.</p><p>It's the first AI agent to use Zed's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction" target="_blank">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>, but the framework is open to all. As long as a custom agent implements the open-source ACP and follows the right schema, developers can use their own agents in the Zed environment. For now, Gemini CLI and Zed's first-party agent serve as two starting points for developers to see the ACP in action.</p><p>The new Gemini CLI integration with Zed aims to better meet the needs of developers who have workflows centered around IDEs rather than a text-only terminal, according to a press release. The offering takes the existing capabilities of Gemini CLI and adds "real-time agentic edit visualization, multi-buffer reviews, and seamless navigation between agentic editing and your existing code."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f7qHLGHHVmerkHkN9thagk" name="Gemini-CLI-Zed" alt="The Gemini CLI side panel in Zed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7qHLGHHVmerkHkN9thagk.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1338" height="754" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Zed users can utilize the "gemini" command to get the Gemini CLI experience they're familiar with right in Zed's integrated terminal. Or, they can use Gemini in the new Agent Panel in Zed's code-editing views, built on the ACP. Gemini CLI can be used in Zed to generate and refractor code in your IDE with a simple prompt and hotkey, or to diagnose issues by highlighting suspect code or selecting error messages to get detailed feedback.</p><p>The AI agent functions similarly to a thinking model, showing the visual changes it's making while completing your request — even if the prompt requires editing multiple files. Additionally, the output works more like a pull request than a typical AI agent, showing every edit proposed by Gemini CLI. From there, you can review, accept, or change anything suggested by the AI agent, so you're still in complete control.</p><p>Beyond what you're working with in your local codebase, you can supply Gemini CLI with context from external sources to help it suggest the correct changes. Since this is all happening within Zed, you won't have to leave your preferred IDE to consult the AI agent for help.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1340px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="JQHuyCaiAHAHh4Vnrb6ChK" name="Zed-AI-Agent-Panel" alt="The agent panel in the Zed code editor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQHuyCaiAHAHh4Vnrb6ChK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1340" height="752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're curious about how it works, like both Gemini CLI and Zed, the process is open source and you can discover it for yourself on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>"We chose to run Gemini CLI as a sub-process, communicating over standard in and standard out," the Zed team explains in a blog post. "We picked JSON RPC for its simplicity and defined a minimal schema for the interaction between Zed, acting as the client a developer uses, and Gemini CLI, running as the agent."</p><p>You can try out Gemini CLI in Zed starting today, and start building AI agents of your own with the ACP.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The website named MediaMarkt - an online electronics website — uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, even without its launch date being announced.</p><p>The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters, which gave us more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE"><u>S25 FE</u></a> is expected to be "thinner and lighter." Which pretty much lines up with earlier leaks that have mentioned the phone to have a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing around 190 grams, approximately 20 grams lighter than its predecessor.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that it will feature "an even brighter screen thanks to the AI ​​ProVisual Engine and has an Armor Aluminum housing with Gorilla Glass Victus Plus."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1852px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.42%;"><img id="5L9u8D8nzHrMdJNRVLXo4j" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5L9u8D8nzHrMdJNRVLXo4j.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1852" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nieuwe Mobiel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other supposed specs of the device, it is expected to feature a triple camera array again with a 50MP main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. The selfie camera is reported as a 12MP lens with an f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>Under the hood, it is said to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a>, which is a two-year-old chip by this point. And it could also retain its battery capacity as its predecessor, which is 4,900 mAh.  The S25 FE could debut with two RAM/storage variations of 8/128GB and 8/256GB. It is said to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/one-ui">One UI</a> 8 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box, loaded with the latest Gemini features, similar to the recently launched foldables lineup.</p><p>As for the cost, the Portuguese website seems to have quoted  €789.99 ($920) for a device, which seems to be on the higher end; however, this could just be a leak or the fact that the website might've jacked up the price. Either way, the publication also notes that the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE "will be officially announced on September 4th, the day before the IFA trade show in Berlin," which doesn't seem too far away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To begin, the host attempts to remove the inner foldable display, removing the bezels first, before trying to (very carefully) pry off that screen. Though there was a brief jump scare, the screen actually bid farewell to the land of the living shortly after, as Nelson "forgot the ribbon cables" inside.</p><p>Nelson then got a closer look at Samsung's ultra-thin glass layer, which is a very flexible glass layer for the display's functionality. However, quickly bending the display the wrong way spidered the glass. Nelson hopes Samsung could make that thicker, further improving its longevity.</p><p>The cover display was difficult to remove; however, it still functioned as Nelson got to looking at the Flip 7's OIS (optical image stabilization) capabilities. The device's OIS held up well, even while it was open on the operating table, offering little jitter when shaken with the camera app open.</p><p>Diving into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">the Flip 7</a>, it was made evident that Samsung had continued to use its pull tabs for the battery and screws for removing most of its initial layer of components. As the publication noted, this could help its repairability score down the line, but there are still difficulties with repairing foldables.</p><p>You can watch Zach Nelson's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/ejGEddhynE0">full teardown of the Flip 7</a>, where he discusses the new changes to the phone's hinge, its thermal specifications, and more.</p><h2 id="teardowns-samsung-s-development-2">Teardowns & Samsung's Development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-7" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CpynvwwhLRpCAqoaaW9bS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7's ultra-thin glass might sound familiar if you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7">Samsung detailing how it created the device</a> and the Fold 7. Funnily enough, Samsung stated that it made the UTG 50% thicker on the Fold 7, which would aid in reducing how noticeable the phone's crease is over time. It's likely a similar upgrade was made to the Flip 7 for its crease. The Flip 7's highlight was its full, edge-to-edge cover display, and its slimmer bezels that Zach Nelson promptly ripped up.</p><p>The Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-teardown-night-terrors-repairability">went through a teardown</a> earlier in August, but that one truly honed in on its repairability, for which there is very little. A video from iFixit spoke about the sheer difficulties one would experience if attempting to fix the Fold 7. It noted how the battery pull tabs are an "inferior" method, as they often break or require too much force, which could bend the battery, rendering it useless.</p><p>Moreover, if your Fold 7's camera has been damaged, someone would have to take the device apart just to fix it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The key highlight of this update is that Gemini's upgraded image editing is a product of a new model from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">Google DeepMind</a>. Google reiterates that all that's required is for you (the user) to provide an image to Gemini to work with.</p><p>Users can apply Gemini's upgraded prompt-based photo editing in a variety of ways.</p><p>One such way is the ability for users to ask Gemini to "blend" two different photos together. For example, users can take a photo of themselves and a photo of their pet and combine them into one coherent image that looks like it always existed. Google states users can upload "multiple photos and blend them together."</p><p>Elsewhere, Gemini's new capabilities can leverage your imagination, turning your once typical selfies into something new. While Gemini reportedly works to keep the subject's core (what they look like) the same, users can tell the AI to change their outfit and change where they are.</p><h2 id="multi-turns-mix-up-prompts-2">Multi-turns & Mix-Up prompts</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:710px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.94%;"><img id="pn9mo7VtAYNR3rmAyb3Vug" name="google-gemini-combine-photo-prompt-example" alt="Google's Gemini can now accept prompts and multiple photos to combine those two images into one coherent scenario." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pn9mo7VtAYNR3rmAyb3Vug.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="710" height="454" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:724px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.94%;"><img id="vtkmfsrUgm7npVdVErQVug" name="google-gemini-combined-photo-example" alt="A combined photo, thanks to Gemini's new AI update, that brought two separate photos of a woman and a dog together into one loving, cuddly image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtkmfsrUgm7npVdVErQVug.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="724" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are two more prompts that Google states Gemini is proficient at: multi-turn editing and mix-up designs. The former is essentially like the Gemini's version of follow-up questions, but for editing images. Google states users can walk step-by-step through editing with Gemini. Specifically, you can have Gemini change up an empty room, such as painting the walls, and then add quick one-liners for additional changes.</p><p>You can tell Gemini to "add a bookshelf," "add a coffee table," and "add a couch," per Google's example. The post states that everything Gemini has created before is preserved in the image until you're satisfied. For the mix-up designs, users can take a photo and tell Gemini to turn it into a dress on a model or to take a pattern from one image and put it on another.</p><p>The Gemini app is receiving this DeepMind-upgraded prompt-based editing capability today (Aug 26), so users should begin noticing it soon.

The original poster (OP) on the Fold subreddit states that their DND (do not disturb) settings will "reset every couple of days" on their own, and that this is causing major problems for their daily life. DND, of course, would mute notifications from disturbing you if you're busy or otherwise.</p><p>However, the user states, "I have various exemptions set on Do Not Disturb," but it doesn't matter since One UI 8 is resetting those exemptions on its own every so often. The user reports that they're using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which runs One UI 8. Two other users have chimed in, reporting similar issues, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1miogsv/comment/na57fae/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">though one states</a> it's "bothering me daily."</p><p>This is causing users to miss out on important notifications, as with DND enabled, you can set if you'd like to silence calls, texts, app notifications, and alarms. The OP likely had these more important notifications enabled (calls, texts), but with DND resetting, they're missing out. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1miohd6/comment/na5956j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user quoted this</a> Galaxy Fold subreddit report over on the One UI side, and signaled that they may have found a temporary workaround.</p><p>They state that they've set up a Routine on their device to only enable DND when charging. They claim that since then, "the settings no longer reset."</p><h2 id="bugs-in-the-software-2">Bugs in the Software</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1miogsv/do_not_disturb_settings_keep_resetting">Do Not Disturb settings keep resetting</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold">r/GalaxyFold</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The publication did its own testing with its Fold 7 and noticed the same bug was occurring for them. After enabling DND and setting their exemptions, the software would reset those, silencing their calls, texts, alerts, and more all over again. These reports will surely catch Samsung's attention, but when a proper fix will arrive is anyone's guess.</p><p>Speaking of strange bugs in One UI 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-latest-beta-bug-drenches-moon-photos-in-a-purple-hue">during the fourth beta era</a>, users reported an odd purple tint over their moon photos. The bug affected Galaxy S25 Ultras enrolled in the test. Additionally, it only appeared when users zoomed in by 30x, 50x, or 100x with the Intelligent Optimization setting. Samsung seemed to be quick to hop on that problem, encouraging users to head to its Samsung Members app to provide detailed feedback.</p><p>More recently, we've gotten our hands on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25">One UI 8 Beta 5</a>, which is (hopefully) signaling that we're closing in on a full release. The 1.78GB update includes several software refinements and the August security patch for testers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on regional pricing, Project Moohan could cost anywhere from $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> but below enterprise VR headsets from brands like Sony in the $4,000+ range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-MWC-2025-1" alt="Samsung Project Moohan on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gGYa9Lf8aLaVXVCa9G4Eg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3877" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">previous leak</a> indicated this headset will use a 1.3-inch, 3552×3840 resolution Micro-OLED display with high brightness and a wide color gamut; its 13.64 million pixels per eye would beat the Apple Vision Pro by almost 2 million and crush the Quest 3 (4.56 million).</p><p>Combined with other premium components like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset</a>, this explains why Samsung would charge top dollar for Moohan.</p><p>But given the Apple Vision Pro's limited sales and Project Moohan's high price, Samsung may not expect to sell many headsets.

I usually just use it while its plugged in but was told that's not a good idea. Does it really matter?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you</strong></em></p><p>Hiya S., and thanks for emailing in with a really good question! We all use our phones while they're plugged in at least every once in a while, so this kind of thing is really good to talk about.</p><p>The quick answer: using your phone while it's charging, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">fast charging</a>, causes more heat to build up. Heat is bad for every part of your phone, and if it gets too hot, you'll see a warning that it's going to shut down. Honestly, though, it probably doesn't make much difference unless you're always doing it.</p><p>Having said that, it <em>does </em>make a difference. There are reasons why you shouldn't, as well as a few simple truths that make the whole issue not worth worrying about.</p><h2 id="heat-is-bad-news-2">Heat is bad news</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="E6xtJCVibaMfCGC5rVVDbK" name="Fluke iSee Thermal Camera" alt="Fluke iSee Thermal Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E6xtJCVibaMfCGC5rVVDbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The parts inside your phone are designed to run hot, but heat is also bad for them. That sounds a little confusing, but you need to realize the difference between hot and <em>too</em> hot, as well as the ways your phone deals with all that heat.</p><p>Some of the parts in your phone will absolutely burn you if you come into contact with them. Electronics are like that, and the way electricity works "creates" heat, so it's not uncommon to see something like a microprocessor reach temperatures into the 75 °C range.</p><p>Your phone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-turns-off-when-extremely-warm">a built-in method</a> to funnel this heat away as fast as it can, though. Some phones are better than others, but every phone has passed testing so that the designers and engineers are satisfied. When you're actively using your phone, it "creates" more heat than when it's idle and the display is off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-03" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Charging your phone also "creates" heat. I'm using quotes around the word creates because technically, it's a conversion of one type of energy into another, but "creates" is easier to understand; it makes things get hotter.</p><p>Other things your phone can and will do when it gets close to being too hot are forcing the processor and GPU to run slower, and even changing the brightness and refresh rate of the display. You might notice this, but know it's done by design to slow down the rate at which the heat is "created".</p><p>Finally, heat negatively affects the cells in your phone's battery. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">lessens the battery's lifespan</a> and capacity and eventually leads to component failure. In severe cases, it can cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-makes-phone-battery-explode">a catastrophic failure</a>, which creates something known as thermal runaway, and your phone could catch fire or explode. Thankfully, that rarely happens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="Qhcu9RAp4NNJeqCcYKfgJK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S22-review-rear-bottom.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S22 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qhcu9RAp4NNJeqCcYKfgJK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2110" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the chance of mechanical damage caused by using a phone while it's plugged in. The cable port was designed to be used when the phone is in one place, and holding it can lead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB port</a> connection to the main board coming loose.</p><p>In short, using your phone while you're charging it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers"><strong>even with a wireless charger</strong></a>, means it will have a shorter lifespan. But it's not as bad as you might be thinking for most of us.</p><h2 id="you-aren-t-keeping-it-forever-2">You aren't keeping it forever</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hBkaGZRqYXh3onjPXQaZ2b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-with-box-2025-02" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hBkaGZRqYXh3onjPXQaZ2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The extra heat caused by using a phone that's charging will make it stop working sooner. There's no question about it. But will it make enough of a difference?</p><p>Not counting your battery, which we'll talk about in a minute, the parts inside your phone will still be in fine working order when you buy a new one. If the heat and clock speeds are managed correctly (they are unless you get in there and change things, voiding the warranty), chances are the components will last for decades.</p><p>Your battery is another story, though. Plain and simple: you are either going to keep a phone long enough to need to change the battery, or you aren't. Two years is about the amount of time it takes before you start to notice your phone battery doesn't hold a charge as long as it used to, but it's measured by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10s-battery-takes-a-hit-after-200-cycles-courtesy-of-a-feature-you-cant-switch-off">charging cycle</a> and not actual time.</p><p>Starting to see what could be an issue yet? The more often you charge your phone, the shorter the lifespan of the battery will be. That's just how it is, and yes, as it gets older, you'll need to charge it more often, making its lifespan even shorter. The extra heat does have an effect here, but not a huge amount.</p><p>Ideally, you'll set your phone down and give it time to charge before you pick it back up again. Using it while you're charging now and then won't make much of a difference, but doing it all the time will mean you might end up replacing the battery or buying a new phone sooner than you had planned.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gamers can customize their Galaxy S25 to feature a Game mode with unique audio rules and presets, and can enable Dolby Atmos for the best quality. Pairing a Galaxy S25 model with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will unlock a low-latency wireless connection for peak responsiveness. </p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-gaming-audio-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-2">Everything you need to know about gaming audio on the Samsung Galaxy S25</h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, making the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Edge, and Galaxy S25 Ultra excellent for gaming. The raw performance is there, but how do the smartphones sound? Gamers will notice that the entire Samsung Galaxy S25 series sports upgraded stereo speakers and Dolby Atmos support for the best in-game experience.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Dolby Atmos adds "multidimensional sound" to Android phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. In other words, enabling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">Dolby Atmos</a> will add directional and spatial audio to your gaming experience, which is crucial in multiplayer games. You'll be able to hear the exact direction footsteps nearby are coming from or where a gunshot off in the distance was fired. Paired with low-latency headphones, Dolby Atmos could give you the competitive edge in games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, Dolby Atmos isn't turned on by default.

Is it worth waiting to see if that happens, or should you jump on this Pixel 9 deal before it's too late? The choice is yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This has been long overdue, considering the tech giant launched its second-gen products back in 2021.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-nest-cam-indoor-2025"> Android Headlines</a>, Google is expected to launch four new Nest products, which include an Indoor and Outdoor Nest cam, a Nest Doorbell, and a smart home speaker that was subtly shown off at this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-google-ai-surprise-bring-powerful-household-assistance"> year's Made by Google event</a>.

Breaking things down, the 3rd-gen indoor Nest camera will allegedly show up 2K HDR camera, a major bump from its 1080p and with a 6x digital zoom. The publication notes that the indoor cam will allow users to "Zoom and Crop" and also focus on a specific zone, for instance, your baby's crib or play area, or your pet's bed. The indoor cam will allow you to record events for up to an hour, even when disconnected from Wifi.</p><p>Additionally, "Google is keeping all of the usual features that Nest owners know and love already, like Activity Zones, Garage Door Alerts, Familiar Face Alerts, and now there’s intelligent alerts," the website adds.</p><p>The renders of the indoor cam show that it is wired and is expected to come in three colors: Snow, Berry, and Hazel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM" name="google-tv-streamer-with-nest-cam-hands-on.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Nest Cam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of launching a third-gen wireless outdoor cam, Google is reportedly working on a second-gen wired camera. It could show up with features similar to the Nest indoor cam, meaning 2K HDR, 6x Zoom, as well as focus areas, Zoom, and Crop features will show up on this one as well. As for colors, the leak claims that we'll see two colorways: Snow and Hazel.</p><p>Furthermore, the new third-gen<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nest-doorbell-aware-subscription-limitations-hello-rename"> Nest doorbell</a> will also have all the above features as the new Nest cams; however, it could get a new feature called "Daily summaries," which is expected to give you a recap of all your recorded events, like a quick wrap of your day, with the help of Gemini.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC" name="doorbell-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest doorbell" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZuXbHA2ktii4vFUyvnXzMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/leak-suggests-googles-mystery-smart-speaker-may-debut-in-four-colors">mystery speaker</a> that we spotted during the Pixel 10 launch will also show <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/leak-suggests-googles-mystery-smart-speaker-may-debut-in-four-colors">up in four colors</a>, looking like a bulkier version of the Nest Mini, which will also be pumped with Gemini.  And it is supposedly being called the "Google Home Speaker."</p><p>While earlier leaks have talked about the design and security features of this smart speaker, this leak talks about its audio. Rumor has it that it will get a  "360-degree sound and has balanced audio, so it’s going to sound very good, despite its small size. Additionally, you can pair it with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">Google TV Streamer,</a>" the publication added.</p><p>That said, Google might be allegedly renaming its paid Nest subscription to "Google Home Premium" and a second plan called "Google Home Premium Advanced," but details about the pricing still remain unknown.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the Android System Key Verifier is the backbone of this, 9to5 states beta testers should find a "Security & Privacy" sub-menu when tapping "verify encryption" in one of your RCS messaging threads.</p><p>When going to verify, the post notes that users should notice a "verify keys for this contact" pop-up, which literally holds the key to your strengthened RCS chat safety. A prominent "Your QR Code" button sits in the center of this sub-menu, above which app/phone number the code will help verify and secure. The QR code works both ways, as users will need to have their contact scan the one on their phone and vice versa.</p><p>Alternatively, users can compare verification codes, which is pretty much the only thing you'd find currently in the Messages app if you were to verify chats.</p><p>The publication's testing also showed that the Android System Key Verifier will initiate scanning, and with a colorful viewfinder, at that.</p><h2 id="make-sure-it-s-the-right-person-2">Make sure it's the right person</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="9JKUp9r87exaGGCMFcEt3g" name="google-messages-qr-codes-key-verifier-beta-example" alt="An example of Google Messages' latest beta, which reportedly brings its new QR code-based verified keys to better protect RCS chats." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9JKUp9r87exaGGCMFcEt3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We first heard about Google supposedly working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-app-secures-your-chats-with-a-twist">an improved way to verify</a> your RCS chats back in November. The Android System Key Verifier is the catalyst behind all this, arriving as an app (that should already be on your device) capable of locking down your RCS chats with encryption keys. As 9to5 notes, Google's explainer about these keys says that they "help ensure only you and your contact can read the RCS messages you send each other."</p><p>Those keys are then shared via the QR codes that you and your friend/family member scan on each other's phones.</p><p>Last fall, it was rumored that these QR codes help to identify one another, ensuring that only you and the one you're texting have access to those messages. It was also stated that this feature would only work on devices running Android 10 or newer. Additionally, the real possibility of someone purchasing a new phone was highlighted.</p><p>If that happens, likely, the verification keys won't match anymore, pushing users to repeat the QR code scanning process. Since the feature's just been spotted in beta, we might be a couple of months away from it arriving. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16's QPR2 Beta 1</a> just dropped, maybe we're looking at that launch timeframe for this Messages feature around then, which would be toward December if anything.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a lengthy interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-21/google-pixel-10-future-of-pixel-google-glasses-interview-with-rick-osterloh">Bloomberg</a>, Osterloh said the Pixel lineup improves by "about 30% each year." Despite that, he says that this year's launch is a “super strong release” in a “mature category.” Bloomberg says that the company has pretty much hit a "plateau when it comes to the design of the device, much like Apple."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the Chief Design Officer for consumer devices at Google, Ivy Ross, disagreed and said that visual changes are in the cards for Pixel devices. “Every two to three years, we look to try and do something with a new design language,” she said.</p><p>Ross also notes that Google is already finalizing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11 series,</a> set to launch in 2026, and has started working on the 2027 lineup of devices as well.

Google relied heavily on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Gemini and other AI tools </a>to up the ante on the Pixel 10 devices, with subtle hardware changes here and there.</p><p>"AI will become the way you interface with a phone to get something done,” Osterloh said. “That will then start to influence the design of it.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X" name="Google-Pixel-10-daily-hub" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MGgJMpGsHFVCmBmMPTwh9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking into the future, Osterloh says that we will definitely see more of this AI integration in its ecosystem, especially on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">XR Glasses</a> and foldables front. However, he reiterates the uncertainty on whether or not Google itself will release glasses again, saying it is still "TBD" (to be decided).</p><p>Finally, Shakil Barkat, VP, devices and services at Google, pretty much confirmed that Google won't be pursuing a flip phone or a smart ring anytime soon. Additionally, it has temporarily halted its plans for its upcoming tablets. The company is rethinking the role tablets will play in the future until it finds a "meaningful future" for the category, according to Bloomberg. Hinting at the fact that the rumors about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-2-alleged-changes-upgrades-report">Pixel Tablet 2 being cancelled</a> might indeed be true.</p> ]]></dc:content>
