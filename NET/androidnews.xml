<p>How much should anyone be paying for a phone case? The question is highly debatable, but I'm sure you've asked yourself this before. After all, smartphone cases these days range from as low as $10 or maybe even less and can go all the way past the $100 mark.</p><p>I know it sounds insane to spend $100 or more on a phone case. For a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap phone that costs about $500</a>, that's already a major fraction of the price of the device itself! As ridiculous as it may seem to be, sometimes it's actually worth the splurge. There are many reasons why you'd want such an expensive phone case.</p><p>But before dishing out my own opinions, I'd like to share what others have told me regarding the matter. I went around asking my colleagues how much they were <em>willing</em> to spend on a case on average. Their like-minded answers highlighted a pattern in buying phone cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-most-people-prefer-to-spend-on-cases-2">What most people prefer to spend on cases</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6" name="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch - 1.JPG" alt="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4288" height="2412" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Android Central writers how much they'd be willing to spend on a phone case. Here's what some of them had to say on the matter. Phones editor Nicholas Sutrich says his max is $20 "unless it's something really special like a Thinborne." Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong had a similar response, saying he'd spend about "$20-ish on Amazon but much more if it’s a brand I trust AND the case has design elements and materials that justify the higher price."</p><p>Meanwhile, news editor Nandika Ravi says she'd spend "Anywhere between $50 to $60 at the most."</p>
<p>Typically speaking, most of Android Central's staff find it appropriate to spend about $20 on an everyday phone cover. The only exceptions come in when a notable brand is involved.</p><p>Why is there an exception when a popular brand comes into play? According to the vox populi, it's all about the build quality and reliability of the brand. Trustworthy phone case makers ensure your phone cover is made of the highest grade materials and actually delivers on the drop protection promises made.</p>

Now, I try to keep it simple. I do pick the more reputable companies, but I wouldn’t pay above $40.</p><figcaption><cite>Michael L Hicks, Senior Editor, Wearables & AR/VR</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>When a name brand is involved, most members of our team — and probably the general public — are willing to stretch their budget to a certain extent.</p>
<h2 id="why-brands-matter-2">Why brands matter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Comparison.jpg" alt="MagSafe accessories on an iPhone and Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Can you get a cheap case from retailers like Amazon? Yes, of course you can. However, the issue arises with no-name brands selling poor-quality silicone, low-grade TPU, or faux leather phone covers, touting them to be "military-grade drop-resistant" when the truth is far from it.</p><p>This is exactly why brands matter and why some folks are willing to spend up to $60 on a protective case for their smartphone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save. If a company like Spigen promises 20ft drop protection, you know that a research & development team actually put the phone cover to the test. It's no wonder an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-case-saves-iphone-from-16000-foot-fall">iPhone survived a 16,000ft fall from a moving airplane in a Spigen case</a>.</p><p>Let's not forget about the insanely slim yet incredulously rugged Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Sutrich doubted the structural integrity of such a minimalist Pixel 9 case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">in his review</a>, but then he dropped it on concrete. This eye-wateringly expensive phone case will set you back $90, but you'll also get the satisfaction of knowing it can live through anything.</p><p>Thus, when a brand like CASETiFY promises impact-proofing on its bumper covers, you can rely on the case to be that tough in actuality. Because if it isn't so, unsatisfied customers know where to find them and how to shame them, perhaps going as far as suing for false advertisement.</p><p>Good luck trying to do any of that with the $3 knock-off you got from Temu. Accountability is non-existent in that scenario.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-2">The bottom line</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y" name="Tudia-cases-nothing-phone-2-honor-magic-6-pro-boox-palma-02.jpg" alt="Tudia cases for the Onyx Boox Palma, Nothing Phone 2, and Honor Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's where I pipe in with my own thoughts. I've been covering phone accessories for several years now, so I can positively reassure you. Brands are important, but that doesn't mean you need to spend $100 for a functional and sturdy phone case.</p><p>Plenty of awesome brands are also accessibly priced. Just look at Spigen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tudia-phone-cases-stock-up">TUDIA</a>, TORRAS, and ESR, to name a few. Even their flagship phone cases for Samsung and Google are priced around $20 or less. I could go on and on, but my point has been made.</p><p>Names like these are proof that a tight budget doesn't automatically compromise the quality of the phone case you can afford.</p><p>At the end of the day, buy a phone case from a reliable brand that fits your budget. It doesn't matter if it's $15 or $150. As long as you do your research on the brand's history, you'll be solid.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9a's release may be just around the corner, and while we anticipate learning more about the phone — several leaks have been coming in hot.</p><p>The most recent one gave us a good look at how the alleged hardware and design of the device. Coming from avid tipster<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1897836775290085404" target="_blank"> Evan Blass</a> are what seem to be official marketing images of the Pixel 9a. In an X (previously Twitter) post, Blass showed off alleged renders of the mid-range phone.</p><p>In terms of the hardware, the Pixel 9a seems to have flat edges, rounded corners, and an end-to-end screen. Additionally, the images confirm what the previous leaks have been pointing towards— the mid-range device could be losing the signature Pixel camera visor. Instead, it will have a pill-shaped housing flush with the rear panel of the phone.</p><p>However, in another image showing the phone horizontally, a sliver of the camera bump seems to exist— indicating that the company may not be letting go of the bump altogether.</p>

<p>As indicated in previous leaks, the Pixel 9a could come in four colorways: Black, silver, pink, and Lilac, but the official names of these colors remain under wraps so far. That said, in the subsequent thread, Blass shows off some of the Gemini's features that could supposedly show up on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>To start, one image shows a person triggering Gemini by holding down the power button. The other images seem to indicate that the phone will come with Android 15's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft protection</a> and several cameras, calling, and general Pixel ecosystem features.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-renders-cases-and-fcc-listing-leak" target="_blank">leak that popped up </a>earlier this week indicated that the Pixel 9a could come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel">satellite connectivity</a> out of the box. The mid-range phone is said to have shown up for FCC certification with the digital label explaining, "The satellite feature on this device must be turned off at all times while on board an aircraft by turning on airplane mode," which is similar to what showed up on the flagship model as well.</p><p>It is important to note that several features that show up in leaks may or may not make it to the actual device. However, here's a detailed list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">what we expect</a> to see from the upcoming Google Pixel 9a.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 9 users can now shoot pictures and videos from different angles as Google is starting to roll out the new Connected Cameras feature to these phones (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/pixel-9-connected-cameras/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Connected Cameras is a feature that was announced along with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel update</a> that came in early this week. This will allow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> owners to connect to another camera placed at a distance (either a GoPro or a Pixel phone) and use it to live stream and record videos.  Users can livestream through any of the supported social media applications like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc., while being able to use the in-app filters on their videos.</p><p>This is particularly useful for people who want to set their phones aside to show off a skill or share their products during a livestream or even while simply biking with their GoPro.</p><p>To enable this feature, users need to head to the Pixel's <strong>Settings > Connected devices > Connection preferences > Connected Cameras</strong>. Here, you'll need to toggle the option on, as it doesn't appear to be enabled by default.</p><p>Once turned on, a floating "Camera Picker" icon will appear when using supported apps. This allows you to add, remove, or disconnect a remote camera as well as switch devices.</p><p>That said, when the Camera Picker isn't in use on the above-mentioned social media apps, it remains minimized. Users can also disable the icon by touching and holding it, then dragging it to the "X" at the bottom of their screen, Google explained on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15985851?visit_id=638769908975773396-2413751535&p=connected_cameras&rd=1">help page</a>.</p>

<p>As of now, this feature is only available for Pixel 9 series devices. It can support secondary cameras using the Pixel 6 and later or the GoPro 10 and later, updated to the latest software version on them.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to note that users can only connect to one additional remote device at a time, and these devices need to be signed into the same Google account. You can switch the connected camera, but you'll have to disconnect the first one.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>TECNO had quite the showing at MWC 2025. The company launched its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-40-series-launch">Camon 40 series</a> with a ton of new AI features, unveiled new AI glasses set to take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, and even has a new lightweight Snapdragon-powered PC. However, the company also has a number of concepts to show off that make our current phones look outright boring by comparison.</p><p>Of course, the most interesting concepts we saw from TECNO are devices like the multi-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">Phantom Ultimate 2</a> and the ultra-thin Spark Slim. These aren't what I'm referring to, although they do give us a good idea of where TECNO wants to go. It's the other concepts that got me excited about what our phones could look and feel like in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-materials-2">Alternative materials</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f2ZDCVmmAbvm9KXGTzCbCJ" name="TECNO-Coconut-Coir" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a coconut coir back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2ZDCVmmAbvm9KXGTzCbCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On display were several dummy models made using various materials, with the idea being to use sustainable or renewable options for phone designs. Among them was a model with a back made using coconut core. This is the outer shell of a coconut that is usually used to make various products like floor mats, mattresses, and other things. It won't smell like coconut, but it's a firm alternative to glass that looks very clean and feels great in hand.</p><p>On the opposite end, TECNO had a model made with used coffee grounds. This actually makes sense because Transsion, TECNO's parent company, has a coffee business in China, and what better way to bring the two together?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J" name="TECNO-coffee-grounds-material-concept" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a back made of coffee grounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design-wise, it's perhaps not as attractive as the coconut coir, but it does look quite unique and could appeal to anyone who likes the more raw look. Furthermore, it actually smells quite good, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like coffee. Imagine how nice it would be to get a bit of a pick-me-up from a quick whiff of your phone!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ" name="TECNO-Multi-Glass-Fiber" alt="A concept TECNO phone with glass fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, TECNO had a phone made with an industry-first multi-colored glass fiber. For this, TECNO used a Jacquard weaving technique, with the end result being a phone that looks like it's studded out in diamonds. In fact, the company used what looks like a jewel in place of the red indicator light next to the cameras and the "o" in "Camon." It's a rather stunning design that can make any phone look premium.</p>
<h2 id="switching-things-up-2">Switching things up</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ" name="TECNO-photochromic-Cellulose-Acetate" alt="Concept TECNO phones with different colors activated with a UV light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO's concepts aren't only about using alternative materials. The company also wants to give us the freedom to change the look of our phones. These proofs-of-concept were probably my favorite of the bunch, as they added a bit of a dynamic nature to the designs.</p><p>Among these devices were a series of phones that use photochromic cellulose acetate, which allows the back cover to change color when exposed to UV light. The company had three phones set up, all of which appeared fairly normal at first glance. But when a representative shined a UV light onto them, they all changed color: one blue, one pink, and one green.</p><p>While I wouldn't expect anyone to carry a UV light around, I can only imagine how cool it could be to have my phone change color whenever I walked outside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J" name="TECNO-Display-Electronic-Slurry" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a DES back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3782" height="2127" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more interesting is the concept that uses Display Electronic Slurry (DES) technology, as seen above. It essentially turns a phone's back panel into a video player with a high DPI and refresh rate, although it reminded me a lot of an E Ink display. Still, it was pretty cool seeing the phones flash with different images, and I imagine you could deck out your phone with whatever designs you want, switching things up to match your mood, outfit, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J" name="TECNO-Starry-Optical-Fiber" alt="The Phantom V Flip 2 with TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And, of course, I can't forget about TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber. The company unveiled this at CES and integrated it into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a>, embedding ultra-fine optical fibers and LED lights in a smartphone back cover. The result is a very out-of-this-world effect that can change between four different modes, and TECNO claims it doesn't impede battery life.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-for-phones-2">What's next for phones?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3878px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YmdR28zhPESQUSAdWhmgzH" name="TECNO-Spark-Slim-stainless-steel" alt="The TECNO Spark Slim in stainless steel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmdR28zhPESQUSAdWhmgzH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3878" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphone design has become pretty boring lately, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> launching as variations of glass and aluminum slabs, and the only way to stand out is with a unique color selection or an outlandish camera design. Look no further than any Samsung phone if you want an indication of how some of the most popular phones have thrown in the design towel.</p><p>Fortunately, we are starting to see more companies switching things up with materials like vegan leather and ceramic. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">TECNO Spark Slim</a> has a stainless steel back that looks like it came out of a Nubian starship from Star Wars, with a camera bar that brings the entire package home with LED lights that run between the dual cameras on either side.</p><p>Unlike the days of dumb phones where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-lg-downfall-made-phones-boring">companies like Nokia</a> could launch the most ridiculous designs (Lipstick phone, anyone?), the modern smartphone era doesn't have the luxury of particularly unique designs. Seeing how far TECNO is going to give our slab phones a new lease on life gives me hope that smartphone design can one day be exciting again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly slipped a new addition into an Android Auto version under development that could positively affect a driver's experience.</p><p>A small, iterative update to Android Auto's 13.9 beta was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/android-auto-temperature-controls-code/">9to5Google</a> with new code teasing a set of new controls. The post states Google has added code in preparation to introduce vehicle air controls. The code seems a little strange, considering it doesn't specify <em>temperature </em>(like hot or cold), specifically.</p><p>What was found only states the pressure at which the air would flow out from your car's vents. According to the APK dive, Android Auto currently contains the following strings: "control_temperature_hi," "control_temperature_lo," and an "off" setting.</p><p>It seems odd that Google would opt for "high" and "low" titles instead of "hot" and "cold" for your car's heat and AC. Unfortunately, the true functions of these newly spotted settings are still unknown as the publication couldn't surface anything concrete.</p><p>If anything, these strings could be the early makings of a truly fleshed out temperature control experience with more to offer. As previously stated, this was found in v13.9.151004 of Android Auto. The post reiterates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/android-auto-13-9-update-rolling-out/">v13.9 beta update</a> rolled out for testers a week ago, which was lackluster in terms of major updates. Google was mostly fixing bugs and altering the language of some of its features.</p>

<p>It also makes us wonder if Google will somehow make its temperature controls vibe with Android Auto's supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-gemini-demo-showcase-reported">Gemini integration</a>. Earlier this week, a demo video surfaced showcasing how Android Auto and Gemini could work together to assist drivers. The AI contained basic functions for playing music through Spotify and answering questions about major landmarks. However, it was clear that Google may need to tweak how it helps users plan a trip.</p><p>The AI was pretty chatty, but offered very little specifics in the early stages of its "affordable trip" breakdown. It wasn't until the end where Gemini shaped up and offered some useful insights.</p><p>If Google is working to apply proper temperature controls in Android Auto, perhaps users could utilize it with Gemini — if things work out, that is.</p><p>Elsewhere, Android Auto's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-appears-to-be-expanding-its-horizons-beyond-just-cars">13.5 update from January</a> showed clues about Google's eventual addition of more vehicles. It seems the company is preparing to welcome motorcycles into its automobile OS ecosystem.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why I put up with Windows on a regular basis is some of the ways it integrates with Android. One such feature is Link to Windows, also known as Phone Link, which allows you to use your phone without actually needing to pick it up.</p><p>Even when it was introduced back in 2018, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Phone Link</a> wasn't the app to offer this kind of integration. However, it was the first time that we saw this kind of experience built into Windows or macOS. The app has continued to evolve, including the ability to actually mirror your phone's screen right on your Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qUHY3usyaUdQTBEgdkC62Z" name="microsoft-link-to-windows-app-windows-11.jpg" alt="Microsoft Link to Windows app on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUHY3usyaUdQTBEgdkC62Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, some Phone Link features, such as screen mirroring, have been limited to only working with certain devices. Until last year, only Samsung phones were available with Link to Windows built-in, but that's no longer the case as it's now being baked into more and more phones.</p><p>Another app was released in 2018 by the name of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy">Scrcpy (screen copy)</a>, which has continued to see regular updates since its initial release. The key benefit of using this over Phone Link is that you can use Scrcpy with <em>any </em>Android device. Just download the app on your Windows computer, enable USB debugging from your phone, fire up Scrcpy, and voila!</p><p>Over the years, quite a few forks of Scrcpy have been released, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NetrisTV/ws-scrcpy" target="_blank">Ws-scrcpy,</a> which is a "web client prototype," or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy" target="_blank">QtScrcpy</a>, which provides more settings to customize. However, I was recently preusing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">Droid-ify</a> and saw an app called ScrcpyForAndroid. Initially, I just figured it was a way to enhance the regular Scrcpy app, but boy, was I wrong.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-2" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of offering more functionality between your Android device and Windows, ScrcpyForAndroid lets you achieve the same thing using two Android devices. Naturally, I immediately downloaded it, made sure I reset the adb port command, and connected the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-a-mobile-gaming-beast-and-it-just-scored-its-first-major-discount-at-amazon">RedMagic 10 Pro</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>At first, it wasn't really quite as smooth as I would've hoped, with graphical glitches and delays making it practically unusable. However, I went over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/zwc456baby/ScrcpyForAndroid">GitHub landing page</a>, and there is a list of instructions. It turns out that I didn't set the resolution and bitrate to the correct figures. So after fixing those, I reconnected the two devices, and it's been working great ever since.</p><p>Apparently, ScrcpyForAndroid was first released in October 2024, and I'm surprised I had yet to come across it. Even still, this actually isn't the first time that I've used something similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> introduced a similar feature built into the device, making it possible to use your phone from the tablet. However, this is only possible if you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. Yet again, we have an awesome feature that's locked down by the manufacturer.</p><p>There are no such limitations here, as ScrcpyForAndroid doesn't care about what devices you're using. All that matters is that you have Wireless USB Debugging enabled on the phone before getting started.</p><p>That's not to say there aren't limitations, even when compared to the standard Scrcpy client app for Windows. For instance, you can drag and drop files between the two devices, but nothing happens. There wasn't an error message or anything; it just didn't work. Honestly, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as I'm just happy that this is even possible without needing to worry about having two devices from the same company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-1" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to RedMagic 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just for chuckles, I tried side-loading the APK on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. After again making sure the settings were right, I connected it to the phone and the RedMagic 10 Pro appeared like magic!</p><p>Then I got the wild idea to try and see if I could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> to show up on the Tab S10 Ultra's display. It's technically possible, provided that Developer Options are enabled, as you need to turn on Wireless Debugging. However, it doesn't quite work the same way as controlling a phone from a tablet or even a tablet from a Chromebook.</p><p>Instead of being able to see your entire screen, ScrcpyForAndroid only displays Android apps when used on a Chromebook. So, after you connect the Chromebook to your Android tablet, you'll only see the Settings app. A way around this is to open whatever Android app you want to use first and then start up the ScrcpyForAndroid connection. In reality, this probably isn't something that anyone would do, but hey, I at least wanted to give it a shot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-chromebook-plus" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear that people want to be able to access and use their phones while also using a computer. As I mentioned before, Phone Link and Link to Windows have been around for years, while Scrcpy has been around for even longer. Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-app-streaming">App Streaming via Phone Hub</a> with ChromeOS 115, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> and macOS Sequoia, Apple introduced iPhone Mirroring.</p><p>However, the overarching theme with all of these options is that you're limited in what devices are compatible or the features that are available. With Scrcpy, there are no such limitations, and it's just another reason why Android devices continue to prove to be more versatile than almost anything else.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini in Workspace is adding a Google Calendar side panel, starting out in Workspace Labs.</li><li>The test allows users to ask questions or create events using AI with Gemini.</li><li>You can sign up for Workspace Labs to try the feature, but there's no way to opt-out of Gemini in Google Calendar unless you leave Labs completely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been steadily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">adding Gemini side panels to Workspace apps</a> and web clients, and Google Calendar is the latest web client to get that treatment. First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-calendar-gemini-side-panel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the side panel is currently being tested in Calendar as part of Workspace Labs. Google explains the full functionality of Gemini in Google Calendar in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/15985129" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>The support document explains that Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> can help you check your schedule, create an event, or look up event details. Android Central was able to test the Gemini side panel in Google Calendar, which includes four suggestions for how you can use it:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ask:</strong> Check my schedule for next week</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a weekly run to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a lunch event to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create: </strong>Add commute blocks to my calendar</li></ul>
<p>The example suggestions provide an idea of how Google sees Gemini in Google Calendar helping users, and it sure seems like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can serve as an AI-based personal assistant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.39%;"><img id="4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA" name="Google-Workspace-Gemini-Side-Panel" alt="The Gemini side panel in Google Workspace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1778" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google explains that conversation history with Gemini in Calendar can easily be lost, including when you refresh your browser, close and reopen Calendar, or lose internet connection. Additionally, you can manually clear your conversation history by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting <strong>Clear history</strong>. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/duet-ai-coming-to-google-workspace-soon">Workspace Labs feature</a>, you might not always get a perfect response.</p><p>"Gemini for Google Workspace is constantly learning and may not be able to support your request," the company says in the support document. "If you get a suggestion that’s inaccurate or that you feel is unsafe, you can submit feedback. Your feedback can help improve AI-assisted Workspace features and broader Google efforts in AI."</p><p>The only way to disable this feature is to leave Workspace Labs, which is permanent. You'll lose all Workspace Labs features and won't be able to rejoin. You can sign up for Workspace Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/labs-sign-up/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>There has been a lot of chatter lately that Samsung could be skipping a couple of major software update steps and jumping straight to the next major software release.</p><p>It was just a couple of days ago that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">Iceuniverse took to X </a>with a bold claim stating the Korean OEM will likely be skipping the One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1 updates and instead will be bringing in a major One UI 8. This is a curious move where, even before officially releasing the much-delayed stable One UI 7 build for the majority of devices, it seems to be developing the new One UI 8.</p><p>Another leaker, Tarun Vats, seems to have spotted a new build in development indicating that the One UI 8 powered by Android 16 could likely be coming to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. He claims that the company started developing the software update two months earlier than usual and that he spotted it being internally tested on the Galaxy S25 series. The build version is as follows:</p><p><em>S938BXXU1BYC1/S938BOXM1BYC1/S938BXXU1BYC1</em></p>

<p>Samsung seems to be fast-tracking its next update in an attempt to keep up with Google's Android 16 rollout that is set to take place in June, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">confirmed by the tech giant during MWC.</a> Also because of the lack of time to develop smaller UI builds before the One UI 8 hits devices.</p><p>Historically, Samsung drops its major software updates closer to October every year. However, this time around, with the OneUI 7, it's a different story. There's no doubt that the One UI 7 rollout has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">continuously pushed out</a> since last year, and now its stable version is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">set to drop </a>on devices only in April.</p><p>However, if Samsung is testing out the One UI 8 two months early, we're keeping our hopes up that beta versions of the build could show up earlier in the Fall.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home Max users are losing the sound detection feature in May 2025.</li><li>The feature is available for Nest Aware subscribers, and will remain for other Home and Nest devices.</li><li>Sound detection made it possible to receive notifications when your Home Max hears dangerous sounds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the Home Max smart speaker back in 2017, and many are in use today. However, as the company recently communicated in an email to owners, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home-max">Google Home Max</a> is losing the sound detection feature (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-home-max-sound-detection/" target="_blank"> 9to5Google</a>). This feature used the Home Max microphone to listen for dangerous sounds, like glass breaking or a smoke alarm ringing, and sent a push notification to the user's smartphone.</p><p>It required a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-aware-vs-ring-protect">Nest Aware subscription</a>, but will be sunset for the Google Home Max on May 8, 2025. Google says that the feature will still be supported "on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription." It's unclear why the feature is being dropped specifically from the Home Max, although the speaker is getting old.</p><p>"Starting May 8, 2025, your Google Home Max will no longer have the sound detection feature as part of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-nest-aware-subscription-your-nest-camera">Nest Aware subscription</a>," the email reads. "Sound detection (which alerts you if glass breaking or a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm is heard) will still be supported on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription."</p><p>Sound detection is useful for making sure you don't miss important security events while you're away from home. A notification that glass broke or that a smoke or carbon monoxide detector went off could help homeowners respond to problems quickly. It's especially helpful for people deep into the Google Home/Nest ecosystems, as you can look into live camera feeds to respond to sound detection pings if you have them.</p><p>As of now, sound detection will still be available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and Google Home mini hardware. 9to5Google points out that the Google Home Max runs an older firmware version, number 1.56.275994, than those other two models, which run 3.75.456944.

<hr>
<p>With the Android 16 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">officially releasing in a couple of months </a>Google IO, OEM makers are trying to make their devices run on the latest stable Android 15 version, and the Moto G64 from India is one of the recent phones to be joining that list.</p><p>Some of the Moto G64 users in the country have spotted the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> rolling out to their handsets. An X user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/moto-g64-android-15-update-india/">91mobiles</a>) has shared the screenshot of the changelog, which indicates that the latest firmware is bearing the <strong>V1TD35H.83-20-5</strong> version. It appears to be a sizeable update as it is 2.26GB.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">G64 Receiving Android 15 Stable Update 🔥🙌🏻 pic.twitter.com/twiV1DuyOS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1895149934078312493">February 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Per the changelog, the Android 15 update to the Moto G64 should make the device faster and more secure, which further includes smoother graphics, and faster app performance, amongst others. This update to the Moto G64 also means users can experience the new Hello UI skin on top of Android 15, which is said to be replacing the My UX skin popular through Android 14.</p><p>As 91mobiles notes, the Moto G64 joins the Android 15 bandwagon just like the Moto Edge 50 Neo which started receiving the update in January. The update is also said to include the latest security patch and notable bug fixes. As Motorola just started rolling out the update this week, users can expect it on their devices in the coming weeks as it is likely a gradual roll-out.</p>

<p>In other news, Motorola is working on its next foldable, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, which recently made its way through leaks featuring a new Rio Red colorway. It is the next clamshell phone from the company, which is expected to debut sometime in April. It is likely to be dubbed the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra in certain regions.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-leaks-rio-red-colorway">recent leak</a>, the device was showcased in all angles, which is likely to sport an all-new Quick Button on one pane. On the inside, the device is expected to have a 6.9-inch pOLED display alongside a 4-inch cover screen, and the chipset powering the handset is likely the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which already powers a significant amount of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> released this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>As mentioned earlier this week, Samsung's promised beta program start for its recent foldable duo is kicking off.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung is currently rolling out One UI 7 Beta 1 to the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The publication states the foldable (if enrolled in the program) will download/install version F741NKSU2ZYBJ. The program arrives with a payload size of 4GB for the clamshell. Curiously, the update was initially spotted arriving for South Korean users today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The program is expected to begin in other regions, as well, like the U.S., but it might take a little time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">clocked the arrival</a> of the program for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Unlike its clamshell duo, the Fold 6's program has supposedly arrived for U.S. users alongside India. The post states the versions are F956U1UEU2ZYBJ<strong> </strong>and F956BXXU2ZYBJ, respectively, at a 5GB download with the March 2025 security patch.</p>

<p>With Samsung doubling down heavily on Galaxy AI, it seems plausible that the huge download sizes for the Flip 6 and Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">include similar features</a> like the Galaxy S24. SamMobile was able to unearth the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-full-changelog/">patch notes</a> for the foldables, which include items like One UI 7's UI overhaul, the Now Bar, separated notification and Quick Panels, and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> is a pretty major addition to the Android 15-based software, letting users gain insights via live updates, access music controls, and routines. In a way, the Now Bar is an easy gateway into Samsung's other major feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. This is an AI-powered feature for upcoming events, weather, and more that arrived on the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>With the test underway, users should be able to gain One UI Beta Program access by heading into the Samsung Members app and signing up — once it lands in your respective region.</p><p>Galaxy users <em>without </em>a Galaxy S25 device have been waiting on One UI 7 for a while, and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently announced</a> it would arrive in April officially. Before that, the company teased the beta program coming to several other devices, like the Flip 6, Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series. Regarding the foldables, the Korean OEM said those respective programs would begin "this week" and it's seemingly making good on that promise.</p><p>For the others, the company's post didn't state when we could see them. However, those beta programs are expected to kick off randomly throughout March. There were also more hints that Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-ai-subscription-is-no-different-than-what-apple-and-google-are-already-doing">start charging</a> for its AI.</p>

<ul><li>Google is working on a "Gemini Personalization" model that uses Search history to influence responses.</li><li>The feature is currently functional in the latest version of the Gemini app beta.</li><li>To use the Personalization model, you'll need to share your search history with Gemini and turn Web and Apps Activity on in settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's advantage in the AI race is that it can integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into its existing products and services, and the company looks to be doing just that with new and upcoming features. First, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">AI Mode for Google Search</a>, which is our first look at how search engines will change thanks to AI. It turns out Google is also working on the reverse — using a user's Google Search history to personalize Gemini's AI responses. That's what Google will do with "Gemini Personalization model," as revealed by Android Authority.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-personalization-model-apk-3533029/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> discovered the unannounced model, which appears to be functional, in version 16.8.31 of the Google app beta. The beta adds a new model, listed as Gemini Personalization. This "experimental" model is described as offering "help based on your Search history." If you choose to connect your Google Search history to Gemini, you'll be able to get more personalized responses to your queries,</p><p>"This version of Gemini uses your Google Search history to give you personalized help," the prompt explains. "In order to use it, you'll need to first connect Gemini to your Search history. You can always disconnect it later."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1182px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.27%;"><img id="yyiTGAXV6bcWodDHM5EWFg" name="Gemini-Personalization-Explainer" alt="Gemini's personalization mode in a Google app beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyiTGAXV6bcWodDHM5EWFg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1182" height="866" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google notes that a user's search history will only be used to influence the Gemini Personalization model, and not any other models. Additionally, the company says that chats using the Personalize model won't be used to train and improve Gemini. It will be saved in Gemini Apps and Activity, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-remove-your-activity-from-gemini">will be deleted after 60 days</a>.</p><p>To use the Gemini Personalization model, you must turn on Web and App Activity in Gemini settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.92%;"><img id="L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg" name="Gemini-Personalization-Demo" alt="Gemini's personalization mode in a Google app beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="1294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Authority's initial tests found that Gemini Personalization was able to accurately call upon a user's Google Search history to respond to queries. Searches dating back to January 2025 were surfaced by Gemini Personalization. The model notes that "some Gemini features are not available in this version."</p><p>Being that the Personalization model is functional in the Google app beta, it's possible that this feature launches soon. It could start off as a Gemini Advanced feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium users</a> only. Google hasn't publicly announced this feature yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s AI Mode is replacing classic search results, starting with Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>AI Mode lets you ask layered questions, follow up, and dig deeper—all within Google Search.</li><li>A new 'AI Mode' button sits in the filter carousel on the left for quick activation.</li><li>On mobile, AI Mode has a dedicated button under the Search bar next to Google Lens and Sound Search.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s AI Mode, its ChatGPT-style search, is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">swapping out traditional results for a chatbot-style experience</a>, at least for paid users.</p><p>Signing up for the Search Labs waitlist is open to everyone, but paid subscribers are getting first dibs on access. If you’re in, you’ll get an email letting you know when it’s your turn to try it out.</p><p>This new feature takes searching up a notch, letting you dive deep with complex, layered questions and follow-up threads all right in Google Search.</p><p>Building on Google's AI Overview system, AI Mode uses a customized version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0</a> to tackle complex questions. With advanced reasoning, analysis, and multimodal capabilities, it's great for deep dives and cross-referencing information.</p><p>AI Mode is just a click away thanks to a new 'AI Mode' button in the filter carousel on the left side of any search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:116.38%;"><img id="5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB" name="Google-Search-AI-Mode" alt="AI Mode in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1856" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On mobile, AI Mode gets its own button right under the Search bar in the Home tab, alongside Google Lens and Sound Search.</p><p>A sleek visual upgrade is the text cursor, which cycles through Google's signature four colors, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-ai-mode-early-access/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This dynamic design, found on both Android and iOS, is paired with vibrant blue, red, yellow, and green animations, especially during voice input and search results.</p><p>One big change is how your search query now sits at the very top of the page, without the usual floating search bar. As for sources, mobile shows them in a carousel at the top and bottom of the screen, while desktop tucks them into a card on the right side.</p><p>Just like with any research, it’s smart to fact-check info from AI sources. AI is great for pulling things together quickly, but it’s not foolproof and can mess up facts or show bias.</p><p>Currently, AI Mode is pretty basic. While it handles text and voice input (on mobile), it only spits out text. However, Google promises future upgrades, including image and video responses, better formatting, and more direct links to relevant content.</p><p>AI Mode is rolling out first to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers. The plan comes with a free month to try it out, then costs $20 a month. Along with AI Mode, you get 2TB of storage and early access to upgraded Google AI tools.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13 was spotted receiving a new update early this morning in the U.S.</li><li>The update is roughly 1.3GB with camera improvements focused in the "tone" capabilities of the OnePlus 13's rear cameras.</li><li>There are rumors that OnePlus is developing a "mini" version of its latest flagship with a massive battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There appears to be an update slowly rolling out for the latest OnePlus flagship phone today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The update's appearance was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> earlier this morning. The patch is marked as version CPH2655_15.0.0.602(EX01) on the flagship with a 1.26GB download size. While the download is sizeable, OnePlus' patch notes don't highlight numerous changes.</p><p>The core of this OxygenOS patch concerns the camera system for the OnePlus 13. The company says it's rolling in a fix to "improve the focus capability of the rear cameras." Additionally, the update works to refine the "tone and color" capabilities when users take photos with the rear camera array.</p><p>Lastly, the changelog notes system "stability and performance" improvements, though it lacks to state what these are — which is pretty standard.</p><p>OnePlus adds the patch contains the February 2025 security patch with this download. It's worth mentioning that OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1805228920841175049">updated its thread</a> on its community forum regarding this update extremely early this morning.</p><p>The company drew attention to users in North America receiving this update. It's likely just beginning to make its rounds, so users should keep their eyes open for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the second time a OnePlus 13 patch has focused on the "tone" of photos with its rear cameras. An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-second-firmware-update-ai-fixes-detailed">update from January</a> not only tried to enhance the stability of its cameras, but also its "tone" capturing capabilities. That update at the beginning of the year came swiftly after the device's very first post-launch. OnePlus was fixing some lingering issues plaguing users while also delivering on some AI promises.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 received a face-to-face AI translation feature, which lets users see what another person is saying in split-view. The update brought the feature to "select" headphones, as well.</p><p>Early January held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-13-gets-gemini-nano-and-oneplus-13r-receives-new-updates">first post-launch update</a> with the inclusion of Google's Gemini Nano integration and generative AI in Messages.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-mini-large-battery-compact-phone-rumors">there are rumors</a> that OnePlus is working on a "13 Mini" with a 6,000mAh battery. Allegedly, the Chinese OEM will work to keep the device extremely thin even with such a huge battery capacity.

<hr>
<p>Samsung's ultra-thin flagship, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, is expected to launch soon — perhaps as early as next month. While the company has shown off the design of the Galaxy S25 Edge, a lot of other details are unknown. However, we now have an idea of how much the Galaxy S25 Edge will cost and weigh, thanks to a leak from tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1897974549045821635?t=Ds2jpGnWAIx2s8DDJf2RXQ&s=19" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>Ice Universe says that the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will be "similar to that of S25 Plus." That aligns with what past rumors have stated, and suggests that Samsung's slim phone will cost around $1,000. The Galaxy S25 Plus retails for $1,000 for the 256GB variant, and that doesn't account for any trade-in deals or offers. Samsung is also still running a promotion that gives you the 512GB configuration, priced at $1,200, for the price of the base model.</p><p>With that in mind, it's likely that the Galaxy S25 Edge price is somewhere in between the base-model Galaxy S25 and the premium Galaxy S25 Plus. If the price is similar between these two phones, which one would you buy? That's what Ice Universe asked in a poll on X, and over 3,300 people voted at the time of publishing this article.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The weight of Galaxy S25 edge is confirmed, 162g, 5.84mm thick, and the price is similar to that of S25+. ​​​
If the price is similar, which would you choose, S25+ or S25 edge?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1897974549045821635">March 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The verdict? Fifty-three percent of people chose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, while just under 47% chose the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's a small sample size, but this poll suggests the Galaxy S25 Edge could be a niche offering — especially at its high price point.</p><p>The other specs of the Galaxy S25 Edge are impressive. The slim phone is rumored to weigh 162 grams and measure 5.84mm thick, according to the latest leaks. Previous rumors predicted that the Galaxy S25 Edge could be lighter, but those appear to be outdated now. Additionally, it will have two cameras, a 3,900mAh battery, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>With a release expected on April 16, we could be just weeks away for a full Galaxy S25 Edge reveal.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you don't mind going for an entry-level phone, and would appreciate an extra $25 off; you're looking for a phone with a decently sized AMOLED screen; having a smartphone with a large battery and/or a 25W charging speed is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance; you want a smartphone with more than 4GB of RAM.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Samsung launched the affordable Galaxy A16 5G in January</a>, and retailers are already offering early discounts on the smartphone.

<ul><li>Honor is seemingly preparing to launch its next foldable, the Honor Magic V4, around June 2025.</li><li>The Honor Magic V4 is tipped to get even thinner, with a thickness under 9mm when folded.</li><li>Honor's upcoming foldable is also expected to have an impressive camera system with a 200MP telephoto camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor could be gearing up to release its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">next foldable</a>, the Honor Magic V4, and the phone's specs have apparently leaked. Known leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5141223314293756" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> revealed many details about the device in a post, including its thickness, screen size, and camera sensors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_magic_v4_leaked_specs_are_insane_oppo_find_n5_to_get_a_true_competitor-news-66836.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Being that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> recently launched to critical acclaim, and is likely to compete directly with the Magic V4, the just-leaked specifications indicate that Honor might bring a real challenger to Oppo.</p><p>For starters, the Honor Magic V4 is tipped to measure less than 9mm when folded and bring an IPX8 water-resistance rating. That'll likely be just as thin as the Oppo Find N5, which measures 8.93mm when folded. However, the Find N5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">has an IPX9 rating</a>, and that's better than the rumored Magic V4's durability.</p><p>The leak also confirms that the Magic V4 will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, just like the regular Honor Magic 7 Pro and the Oppo Find N5. It's unclear whether it'll use the foldable version of the chip — the same seven-core variant that the Find N5 also uses — or the fully-featured version in the Magic 7 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-17.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 tent mode against table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldable phones have always come with camera compromises, but Honor might be trying to break that trend with the Magic V4. The main camera is said to be a 50MP lens with a 1/1.5-inch sensor size. Meanwhile, that's paired with a 200MP telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and 3x optical zoom support. We don't yet know if that could be paired with another camera, but since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> used a triple-camera setup, it's likely.</p><p>Finally, the report indicates that the Honor Magic V4 will be equipped with an 8-inch main screen and a 6.45-inch cover screen. Wireless charging and satellite connectivity will be available, too.</p><p>Current predictions expect the Honor Magic V4 to launch around June 2025, and leaks should come more frequently as that timeframe gets closer. It's possible that the Magic V4 launches in China before Europe, as is typically the case with Honor launches.</p>

That's a good thing in countries like India, where a mobile phone is often the only screen available. So any headway that can be made to make gaming better — or just about any other use case on mobile — has tangible gains.</p>

<p>That's why I was excited to talk to Arm's senior director of smartphone segment strategy, Steve Raphael, to know about the brand's plans relating to mobile gaming and AI innovations. Raphael talked about Arm's mission to bring "console-quality" gaming to mobile, and that it has an "amazing roadmap" of announcements in this area. <br><br>Raphael talked about technologies that have made a real difference in the world of Windows gaming — DLSS or FSR — and bringing something similar to mobile devices. Arm introduced Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR) nine months ago, but it started demoing the tech in action at MWC 2025, and is slated to serve up additional details at GDC 2025 in a few weeks' time. <br><br>Similar to NVIDIA's DLSS, ASR uses temporal upscaling to deliver significantly better visual fidelity. Essentially, the tech renders a scene at a lower resolution, and uses AI models to upscale to a higher resolution, leading to smoother framerates and better clarity. Arm showcased a demo running on a device powered by the Immortalis-G925 that was connected to a tablet, and while there was some artifacting, it was smooth, and the overall visual quality was terrific. <br><br>The tech can deliver gains of up to 53%, and I see it making a difference in budget and mid-range chipsets, where there's a need for this kind of a feature. Arm isn't starting from scratch, instead leveraging AMD's open-source FSR2 upscaler as the foundation — this is absolutely the right move, as it allows Arm a decent head-start.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-NuqCFGGTY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Upscaling makes sense on mobile as there's a limited power budget on the device, and any shortcut you can take to increase framerates without overheating or needlessly throttling is a huge bonus. And as this is being baked in at the platform level, all devices that are powered by Arm hardware — basically every Android phone — stand to benefit. <br><br>I shifted gears to talking about AI and mobile NPUs, and Raphael stated that Arm did a "tremendous amount of work" this year to make it easy to load AI applications into the CPU, integrating numerous libraries and optimizing usability so they're effortless to get started.</p><p>On that note, Arm teamed up with Stability AI to bring generative audio to phones, and it showcased the tech in action at MWC 2025. The brand is going to debut image, video, and 3D generation tools on its devices in the coming months. Most AI use cases on mobile are cloud-driven, but it isn't sustainable to send swathes of data to a cloud server to get the requisite information; Raphael talked about this "asymmetry" where considerable energy is used to send data to a cloud server, and how it ends up being a "huge burden." <br><br>Balancing efficiency with performance is going to be pivotal with these AI workloads, and Raphael mentioned how the brand made "phenomenal amounts of efficiency gains" in the last two years, and that Arm is looking to deliver more AI use cases on-device instead of information going to the cloud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="raKeF2zCnULWMkURqUTdMP" name="arm-mwc-25-1" alt="Arm audio generator running Stability AI on-device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/raKeF2zCnULWMkURqUTdMP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also asked about the recent trend with mobile platforms where manufacturers like MediaTek and Qualcomm are leveraging big cores exclusively in their products instead of the heterogenous configurations we've seen in years past. Raphael said that it is driven by a need for Arm's partners to deliver the best possible performance, and that although designs like the Dimensity 9400 exclusively use Cortex X925, X725, and A720, the inherent gains with the latest v9 core means they deliver much better efficiency than their predecessors. <br><br>Raphael also mentioned a key point about the frequencies at play, noting that although cores now go up to over 4GHz, the time that they're actually running at that frequency is minuscule, often measured in milliseconds. The idea is to execute a task as fast as possible — such as an app launch — and go back to idle state to maximize efficiency, and this is what makes devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> last at least a day and a half even though it is made up entirely of powerful cores. <br><br>Lastly, I talked about Arm's licensing model and whether we'll see any changes on that front. Raphael stated emphatically that Arm's current model is its "bread and butter," and as it stands to benefit by sharing in a brand's success via royalties, it doesn't see the need to alter the status quo. I asked about the situation with Qualcomm and whether that was resolved, but predictably, I didn't get a comment either way. <br><br>Having used NVIDIA's DLSS extensively in the last four years, I'm excited to see how Arm can leverage ASR on mobile devices. The demos it showcased are promising, and the fact that this is agnostic of device maker or chip vendor means all Android devices can take advantage of the tech, and that's a great thing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor has been in the news lately for jumping on the AI train(better late than never) and launching its AI strategy at the MWC this week. Calling it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a>, the company plans to integrate it into its current and upcoming devices. (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/honor-mini-flagship-slim-phone-rumors/">via 9to5Google</a>)</p><p>The company wants to integrate the Alpha Plan in a three-step strategy, that focuses on intelligent phones, AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).</p><p>Additionally, it looks like the company is trying to stay relevant and get on the slim device trend as well. In a recent leak that surfaced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5140777514045884">Weibo</a>, a tipster claims that the company is working on a "small screen" flagship device, which Digital Chat Station states will also be ultra-thin.</p><p>The tipster added that the phone would measure about 6.3 inches and would be called "Yaozi" —which according to the tipster is a Chinese word for "glory." Digital Chat Station also added that a new folder has been created, indicating that the company has just begun working on this phone and is in the initial development stages.</p><p>While 6.3 inches isn't small, it could still measure less than their most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. While we don't have much information about the above slim phone, it would be nice to see some more specs of this alleged phone, to back the tipster's claims.</p><p>That said,  several major OEMs are chasing the ultra-slim phone dream— which seems like a growing trend in the industry. While Samsung showed off its Galaxy S25 Edge at the MWC, another ultra-thin phone by Techno, measuring 5.75mm was spotted by Harish Jonnalagadda at the tech conference.</p><p>Stealing Samsung's thunder is the razor-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Techno Spark Slim</a>, which is currently the world's slimmest phone, and if Honor is working on its version in the same category, it would be interesting to see how "slim" is Ultra slim for this OEM, that could come with Honor's new Alpha AI.</p>

That's where this list comes in, as Android Central's Derrek Lee and Harish Jonnalagadda list out some of the coolest (and weirdest) devices at MWC 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-s-very-thin-phone"><span>TECNO's very thin phone</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yTJb3c9fB5kM5gV2QpoTT4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTJb3c9fB5kM5gV2QpoTT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Spark Slim</a> is one of the most impressive devices at the show. Not only does it have an incredibly sleek design, but the phone measures just 5.75mm in thickness. What's amazing about this is that TECNO managed to squeeze a fairly large 5,200mAh battery into the phone, which is larger than the battery powering the rather massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The design looks like a futuristic Nexus, with a camera bar spanning the top of the phone and LEDs and unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels, both of which look better than most phones on the market today. For now, the phone is just a concept, but with the renewed interest in thin phones this year, we hope it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-display-s-claw-like-foldable"><span>Samsung Display's claw-like foldable</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6snAS3CfJTptXepvTZSzkK" name="Samsung-Display-Asymmetric-Flip" alt="Samsung Display's Asymmetric Flip closed and showing a notification" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6snAS3CfJTptXepvTZSzkK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So-called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-fold</a>" phones are slowly becoming a thing, but this device does things a little differently. Instead of a large phone opening to a tablet-sized device, this Samsung Display concept takes the flip form factor and flips the script... again. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.</p><p>Even more unique is the fact that it leaves a section of the display visible when the phone is closed, allowing the user to view notifications or the like from the small sliver of the screen. It's by far one of the weirdest designs we've seen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-realme-phone-lets-you-use-camera-lenses"><span>This Realme phone lets you use camera lenses</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iSGsXooVv3ko6sAEDzzXdW" name="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens" alt="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens demo at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSGsXooVv3ko6sAEDzzXdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Realme showcased the Ultra at MWC 2025, and the main highlight of the device is that it has a 1-inch sensor — much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and other Chinese rivals. However, unlike all of those phones, Realme managed to add a mount to the back of the Ultra, allowing you to attach standard camera lenses to the phone. It is a neat idea, and Realme had a 10x lens that allowed the device to take lossless images at that zoom factor. As you'd imagine, the camera lens is absolutely massive, but it is usable — more so than I initially imagined.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cwEgumvxF7NwJ3oSwTThjW" name="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens" alt="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens demo at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwEgumvxF7NwJ3oSwTThjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this isn't a retail product yet, but Realme has indicated that it will start selling a variant of the phone to consumers at some point. The lens that Realme showcased had a custom mount, but if the brand is able to deliver a retail device that works with standard Sony, Canon, or Nikon lens mounts, it would make the phone so much more versatile as a camera package.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-also-has-an-interchangeable-lens-on-a-phone"><span>Xiaomi also has an interchangeable lens on a phone</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iimLHJbUHRBabAt7HZPaYc" name="Xiaomi Modular Optical System" alt="Xiaomi Modular Optical System demo at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iimLHJbUHRBabAt7HZPaYc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi also tried its hand at attaching a lens to the back of its phone — in this case, a custom Xiaomi 15 — and unlike Realme, it bolted on magnetic ring with pogo pins to the back of the device to facilitate the lens. The result is a cleaner look, and you can use the main cameras in addition to the lens attachment. The lens itself is considerably shorter than most traditional DSLR lenses, and the 35mm focal length is ideal for shooting in day-to-day scenarios.</p>

<p>Xiaomi says the pogo pins make it near-instantaneous to transfer imagery data to the device, and I like the idea of being able to attach lenses to the back of an existing phone. Xiaomi didn't say if it would put this idea into production, but it is possible we may see something along these lines on the next Ultra device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-your-next-handheld-console-could-be-a-foldable"><span>Your next handheld console could be a foldable</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fmXVMzL57yee36QxvXRuBi" name="Samsung Foldable OLED" alt="Samsung Foldable OLED demo panels at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmXVMzL57yee36QxvXRuBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung knows how to make standout foldable OLED panels, and at MWC, Samsung Display showcased what's on the horizon. The star attraction is a handheld console with a foldable panel; it bends in the middle similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it is an undoubtedly cool idea. The demo unit was just to highlight the panel, so it wasn't a full-fledged console as such, but I'm excited to see one of the many handheld brands try to leverage this design — I would love to use a foldable Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Samsung also highlighted its Flex G and Flex S designs; these are foldable panels aimed at tri-folding and multi-folding devices, and while it is unlikely we'll see Samsung release phones that use these OLED panels anytime soon, it's great to see that the tech itself is available.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-has-a-tri-fold-to-take-on-the-huawei-mate-xt"><span>TECNO has a tri-fold to take on the Huawei Mate XT</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qZxmCRaJtp6MkzuMV5XdXn" name="Tecno Phantom Ultimate 2" alt="Tecno Phantom Ultimate 2 hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qZxmCRaJtp6MkzuMV5XdXn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm thoroughly enjoying using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, and the tri-folding device is holding up much better than I imagined. Tecno demoed its own tri-folding device at MWC, and it is pretty great in its own right. While it isn't as sleek as the Mate XT, it has a usable tri-folding design, and it also extends to a tablet-sized panel.</p>
<p>Tecno didn't detail much about the device, but the one advantage it has over the Mate XT is that it has Google's Play Store and associated mobile services installed out of the box. Like the Tecno Spark Slim, the brand doesn't have any plans to introduce this device as a retail offering at this moment in time, but I want that to change.</p>

<p>Mudra Link is a unique gesture control wristband that leverages neural signals to drive interactions. It connects via Bluetooth, and in the MWC 2025 demo, it was paired to a Mac Mini and was able to control the volume and play a virtual violin instrument. There's also a Mudra Band that can be used with the Apple Watch, giving you the ability to control the Apple TV from your wrist. Mudra says it's working with XR device manufacturers to integrate the Link with their devices, and that sounds interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>Infinix had one of the coolest demos at MWC 2025, with its E-Color Shift 2.0 phone featuring a color E Ink panel at the back that changes colors dynamically. There's the option to change colors to custom patterns or designs, and you can also tweak the back colors to reflect the weather, your mood, or even an emoji. It did a great job changing colors on the fly, and the use of E Ink at the back to do so is a novel idea.</p>
<p>Infinix says it is mulling debuting a phone with similar tech, but there are no plans to bring this particular device to market. Even then, I'm positive another brand will see what Infinix did here and will try to leverage the same idea in its own device.</p>

<p>As an honoree for best AI innovation at MWC, Honor is doing a very interesting thing with its AI. The company had a robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with. Paxini includes a camera that can view your hand and then replicate your movements. A computer was set up to stream the feed from Paxini so you can see how it's analyzing your hand's movements. It wasn't immediately clear what Honor planned to do with the hand, but there's no doubt there could be plenty of uses for something like this.</p>

<p>With the adoption of telephoto lenses on smartphones, we're finally graduating from the era of digital-only zoom. ZTE is taking things a step further with the Nubia Focus 2 Ultra, which features a ring around the camera housing that can be physically rotated to control the zoom. ZTE says the Focus 2 Ultra has a 108MP primary camera and five focal lengths. With the zoom ring, users can close in on a subject up to 10x, and you even get a camera button to complete the package, making this the ultimate camera phone.</p>

<p>We love smart glasses here, and if you're a cyclist, then these glasses are for you. Not only do they look cool, but there's a 16MP camera in the middle that is capable of capturing smooth 1080p video for up to four hours. What's cool is that they use AI to create automatic highlights within the app, and then you can stitch the clips together for an ultimate highlight video, complete with your route and stats like speed, distance, and duration. Plus, there's a great set of open-ear surround-sound speakers to keep you both entertained and aware of your surroundings.</p>

<p>Android has had a few goes at a true FaceID competitor, but nothing has really stuck. Metalenz is trying to change that with Polar ID, which uses the company's technology to not only make traditional camera stacks smaller and smarter but also bring FaceID-levels of biometric security to Android phones. It appears to be much more secure than what's available on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">Google Pixel</a> and is even smart enough not to be fooled by masks or even a 3D printout of someone's face.</p><p>Polar ID is supported on flagship Snapdragon chips, and the company is talking to OEMs now, so hopefully, we'll be seeing this tech on our next smartphones.</p>

<p>RayNeo is doing all the right things in the XR category, and the X3 Pro is definitely interesting. The AR glasses use a micro-LED light engine and go up to 2500 nits, and there's a camera at the front that lets you record photos and videos. The best feature is the built-in AI translation; it translates conversations in real-time, and it did an effective job in the demo that RayNeo set up on the convention floor. The glasses are coming out in the latter half of the year, and I can't wait to get my hands on the product.</p>

<p>Foldables phones have become mainstream these days, but that isn't the case with notebooks. Well, Lenovo is aiming to change that with the ThinkBook Flip, a device that has an absurd 18.1-inch panel that folds outwards. Other than the fact that the panel folding outwards means there's always a section that's prone to damage should it take a tumble, I don't really see how the extra-tall width makes sense on a notebook. This is just a demo at this point, and it's unlikely Lenovo will introduce a consumer model anytime soon.</p>

<p>Etisalat is the UAE's biggest carrier, and it now goes by the name e&. Anyway, it had a humanoid robot at its booth made by the U.K.'s Engineering Arts, and it was pretty convincing. Called Amira, the robot mimics facial cues easily, and it uses AI to converse. Engineering Arts noted that the robot on the show floor was controlled by a human to answer queries — we were told that is the only reliable way to make any sense of dozens of attendings shouting questions at once — so we don't have to be too worried about the robot apocalypse.</p>

<ul><li>Widgets will arrive on the lock screen for Android phones and tablets later this year with Android 16 QPR1.</li><li>Google brought lock screen widgets to the Pixel Tablet with Android 15, and the feature will be available as part of the AOSP in "late Summer 2025."</li><li>While the update will be available for OEMs to implement, device manufactures won't be able to customize the experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Lock Screen widgets are a crucial part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> experience, and they're coming to all Android phones later this year. Google announced the move in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/widgets-on-lock-screen-faq.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the Android Developers Blog today, March 6. The update will be pushed to the Android Open Source Project in "late Summer 2025" and "all widgets are compatible with the lock screen widget experience," according to the company.</p><p>"Lock screen widgets will be available in AOSP for tablets and mobile starting with the release after Android 16 (QPR1)," the company says in the post. Pixel phones might get lock screen widgets first, as the blog post notes "other device manufacturers may update their devices as well once the feature is available in AOSP."</p><p>The update coming as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 will not only boost the capabilities of Android phones, but could also third-party Android tablets, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup</a>. However, it's up to those third-party OEMs to implement the functionality when it becomes available. Notably, Google says device manufacturers can't customize the appearance of lock screen widgets, so it's possible some OEMs might opt not to include this feature.</p><p>"All lock screen widgets will have the same developer experience on all devices," the company adds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJDp3PYcTYEc2ruefbfFLJ" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-vertical-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Tablet in vertical mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJDp3PYcTYEc2ruefbfFLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also provides insight on how widgets might appear on the lock screen in the form of developer instructions. "For the best experience, please make sure your widget supports dynamic color and dynamic resizing," the post explains. "Lock screen widgets are sized to approximately 4 cells wide by 3 cells tall on the launcher, but exact dimensions vary by device."</p><p>Lock screen widgets, when available, could give users more ways to easily take actions within apps with fewer taps. Android 16 is set to bring multiple new experiences to the lock screen, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates">Live Updates are also expected to arrive</a> as part of the update.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Head of Android said the tech giant is on track to release Android 16 in June, due to the new ‘Trunk Stable’ development process.</li><li>The tech giant plans to highlight a few features from this update for users early on.</li><li>However, with major OS drops, the company is still deciding if they want to release all the new features in one go or do it as quarterly Android updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 16 is the next big thing for Google other than releasing its yearly devices and this time it's doing things differently. Major software rollouts are usually accompanied by the company’s flagship model (Pixel 10 this year) in August every year; however, Google is on track to give us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> earlier in June, with the company’s President of Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, confirming the same at MWC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-16-is-on-track-for-june/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Samat said, “So far, so good. I've never had a release where at this point the bug count was where I wanted it to be, but the team is working really hard, and we're excited about getting it there.”</p><p>The tech giant has set this early goal for itself and according to the company, this is due to the recent changes within the Android team. This happened late last year when Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai announced the merger of the software and hardware teams, bringing the Platforms and Devices team under one roof. We assume that this could have brought a shift in key goals, which accelerated the company’s software rollout.</p><p>Speaking further to the publication, Samat mentioned that the team is now in something called the “Trunk Stable” stage— this essentially means that all developers working on the software are contributing their efforts to a single shared branch of code. In contrast to what would happen earlier, where developers would work separately on different branches and merge closer to the release. This would allow for the teams to perform several tests on the software to look for bugs and defects — allowing for an early release.</p>

<p>“One of the reasons for the original release schedule is we would do that merge in June. Then it would take us from June until later in the year to work out all of those issues. And so one of the challenges we set ourselves internally is to see if we can get this out earlier,” Samat added.</p><p>The Android head added that the company will be doing more to highlight what this major software update would bring to devices, possibly hinting at showing off some features before launch.</p><p>"When we have new capabilities, the decision is always between do we hold this for an operating system release  or do we give it to people on a more quarterly cadence with Android drops."</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">recent rumor was floating</a> around that Samsung will not be releasing incremental updates like "One UI 7.1" or "One UI 7.1.1." but it will jump right ahead to the One UI 8, considering Google’s Android 16 early release.</p><p>The Korean OEM’s One UI 7 is delayed until April and tipster Ice Universe thinks the company won't be bringing any more updates to this version of the software. Considering they might have to jump right ahead to the next one, with Google all set to release Android 16 earlier.</p><p>However, this claim doesn’t have any backing, but with the way Samsung is treating its current software rollout, it is highly unlikely it will jump to the next one as early as June.</p>

<ul><li>Google is moving the Project Gemini team from the Google DeepMind group to the Gemini app umbrella.</li><li>The Gemini app now has a new VP, as ex-Meta VP Chris Struhar will lead the group.</li><li>Project Astra is set to launch for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel phones later this month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Project Astra began as one of Google's more ambitious research projects when it was teased at Google I/O 2024 last year. Android Central tried it as part of a large demo setup, and the plan was always to scale that down to be able to run on Google Pixel phones. More recently, Project Astra has progressed, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">Google is now planning to release it</a> for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel phones this month.</p><p>Ahead of that move, Google is making a few organizational changes for Project Astra, as announced internally today, March 6, and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/gemini-astra-team/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The team working on Project Astra will now be part of the larger Gemini app team, as Project Astra will soon be part of the multimodal Gemini Live. Previously, the group working on Project Astra was organized under Google DeepMind, the company's research sector working on Astra and other projects, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>.</p><p>While 9to5Google reports some parts of the Project Astra team will remain with DeepMind, the bulk of the Astra group will now be organized under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app team. Additionally, the team has a new head, as Chris Struhar is now the Vice President of Product for the Gemini app.</p><p>The company announced the ex-Meta VP will lead the Gemini app in a corresponding move today. Struhar will be reporting to VP and General Manager Sissie Hsiao, who leads everything Gemini and Google Assistant related.</p>

<p>When it releases later this month, Astra will add new multimodal capabilities to Gemini Live. Users will be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">share their live video feed and share their screen</a>  to get more personalized responses in real time from Gemini Live.</p><p>The next steps for Project Astra will be getting it to run on wearable hardware, including AR and VR applications. Google asked for "trusted testers" to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">join a Project Astra waitlist</a> to test this kind of functionality at the end of last year.</p>

<ul><li>Android 16 Beta 2.1 is a subtle update that includes working Live Updates for Google Maps.</li><li>Users can track their navigation progress in the status bar, notification panel, and on the lock screen with Live Updates.</li><li>The feature isn't fully working as of yet, since Live Updates appear collapsed with the always-on display in use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-is-here-to-fix-a-set-of-annoying-bugs">Android 16 Beta 2.1 update last week</a>, and it was originally thought to be a minor patch. The update included fixes for a few annoying bugs, including one that forced Pixel phones to restart without warning. However, Android expert Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-live-updates-3532808/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has discovered that Android 16 Beta 2.1 adds support for Live Updates in Google Maps.</p><p>Live Updates are coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and they're like Live Activities on iPhones. These are time-sensitive notifications that can remain in various places on your Android phone to provide glanceable updates, like the status of your rideshare or the progress of your Google Maps journey. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-live-updates-chip-notification-panel-demo">previewed Live Updates in a beta test demo last month</a>, but Android 16 Beta 2.1 is the first time we've seen them working with a real app.</p><p>As noted by Rahman, Live Updates for Google Maps only works properly in a few locations in Android 16 Beta 2.1. Live Updates are intended to appear in multiple locations, including the notification panel, lock screen, always-on display, and status bar. Android Authority noticed Live Updates from Google Maps appearing in the status bar, lock screen, and notification panel, but support for always-on displays appears to be incomplete.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.56%;"><img id="LFqt25rMFR7kbDR3ySqsaf" name="Live-Updates-Maps" alt="Live Updates in Android 16 Beta 2.1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFqt25rMFR7kbDR3ySqsaf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1046" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the report, Google Maps' Live Updates appeared in collapsed views on the always-on display in Android Beta 2.1. Meanwhile, Google's beta preview of Live Updates saw the feature working fully with an expanded view on the always-on display. It's possible that Google is still working on this functionality, or that it's limited to certain apps.</p><p>Due to size limitations, the Live Updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> in the status bar are extremely limited. The tiny and green pill-shaped Live Update in the status bar for Google Maps merely showed the time until you've reached your destination. More information was available on the lock screen or notification panel.</p><p>Live Updates are expected to become available with Android 16 when it debuts later this year. It's possible we could see expanded functionality for Live Updates as the Android Beta Program continues.</p>

<ul><li>Surprising rumors claim Samsung is interested in rolling out its Android 16-based software, One UI 8, much earlier this year.</li><li>A tipster on X states the company "will not" do incremental updates like "One UI 7.1" or a "One UI 7.1.1."</li><li>One UI 7 has been met with incredible delays since the fall of 2024; however, Samsung states it should rollout officially in April.</li><li>Android 16 is also expected to debut much earlier this year from Google, perhaps in Q2 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Don't think anyone had this on their bingo card; rumors claim Samsung's Android 16-based update could rollout soon after its (delayed) Android 15 upgrade.</p><p>The rumor was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1896420740305694943">posted on X</a> by prominent tipster IceUniverse, claiming Samsung's One UI 8 update could rollout much sooner this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/one-ui-8-release-rumor/">Pocket-lint</a>). The Korean OEM <em>typically </em>launches its major Android upgrade toward the fall, sometime after Google releases it.</p><p>However, the tipster states we might see a rush order in for One UI 8 as Samsung skips the in-between updates for One UI 7.</p><p>IceUniverse states Galaxy users might not see a "One UI 7.1" or "One UI 7.1.1" this year, like we have with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI 6 throughout 2024</a>. Unfortunately, rumors end there as the tipster doesn't purport a potential timeline for a One UI 8 (Android 16) launch for Galaxy devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next version of One UI 7.0 is One UI 8.0, there is no One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1896420740305694943">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There's no hiding the fact that One UI 7 has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">continuously hit with delays</a> since last year. Just as Galaxy users thought they were in the clear, another one was reported in February — which then came true <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">later that month</a>. Samsung rolled out One UI 7 Beta 5 quickly after Beta 4, packed with a few bug fixes and solutions for crashes. The software was delayed (again) in February due to a display issue with a screen optimization mode.</p><p>Fast-forward to March and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">announced</a> its major One UI 7 (Android 15) update <em>should </em>arrive officially in April for eligible devices.</p><p>Things become interesting here as, according to Samsung, it will begin a beta program for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series in March. Hopefully, these devices won't see as many delays, especially when you factor in what rumors suggest today.</p><p>Another point to consider is Google is working to release Android 16 much quicker in 2025 than it has previously. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">Android 16 Beta 2</a> rolled out in February, which was pretty on track for Google's set schedule this year. The company is interested in launching the next software in Q2 2025, urging our eyes toward an April and June timeframe.</p><p>It seems like Samsung is trying to rush One UI 8 because of this — for competition and user postivity, no doubt. We'll have to wait and see what happens with One UI 7 first, though.</p>

<p>Civilization VII is on the way to the Meta Quest sometime this Spring, but you don't have to wait until then to play great strategy games on your Meta Quest headset. Strategy games in VR come to life like never before, giving you a new angle on the action so you can get up close and personal.</p><p>Whether it's commanding armies, building cities, directing ships to attack or mine, or even terraforming an entire planet, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount of high-quality strategy games already available on the Meta Quest platform. I can't wait to see Civilization like never before on my dining room table in a living board game but, until then, here's how I'm strategizing away my time.</p>

<p>Underworld Overseer sees you excavating and managing a dungeon from the perspective of the almighty Overseer, including the ability to directly pick up your units and move them around where you want. As you command your units to dig further underground, you'll unearth treasures galore and build new areas that'll attract all sorts of different creatures to your dungeon.</p><p>The game evokes memories of the hit Dungeon Keeper games from the 90s and early 2000s, something I lauded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/underworld-overseer-is-dungeon-keeper-spiritual-sequel">when I first wrote about</a> Underworld Overseer last October. I got access to the next big update recently and it offers additional levels and challenging new enemies for free. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014023">a PSVR 2 version</a> is coming out soon!</p>

<p>Demeo has been the go-to recommendation for turn-based strategy for years. Demeo sees players choose one of seven different heroes, each with their own unique set of skills and movement options. Players make two actions during each turn which consists of movement, attacks, or special cards in their hand. Levels are proceedurally generated and scale up to four players.</p><p>It's a brilliant multiplayer title that's managed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">sidestep the toxic nature</a> of many multiplayer games, offering up a friendly community and tons of fun.

<p>Little Cities proved that city building doesn't need to only be for the hardcore stat nerds that love games like SimCity and Cities. That's not to say that these folks won't <em>also</em> enjoy Little Cities, but the game isn't designed to keep you in your headset for hours at a time, just little sessions here and there as you desire.</p><p>Each session begins with an empty island that you'll need to zone for and build on to create the mini city of your dreams. A little $6.99 DLC package introduces snowy islands that bring winter coziness to this already cozy game, and hand tracking support means you don't even have to grab your controllers to have fun. If you do want more detailed city building, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/cities-vr/4046879905345967/">Cities VR</a> is actually a game on the Quest, too.</p>

<p>Sick of building on Earth? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-took-elon-musks-advice-and-nuked-mars-in-this-amazing-quest-game">Per Aspera VR</a> will take you to the red planet to terraform and colonize its harsh landscape into something a lot more livable for humans. It's more stat-heavy than Little Cities but I didn't get overwhelmed by it at all. In fact, I had an easier time playing this one in VR because of the VR-centric controls and the ability to feel more "aware" of the planet, as a whole.</p><p>Aside from great gameplay, the game's story is intriguing and well voice-acted. You'll begin the game playing as AMI, an artificial intelligence (or maybe not so artificial since it's <em>you</em>) that has been tasked with getting the planet ready for the first humans, scheduled to arrive in a few short years. A DLC even brings about life in Mars after terraforming is done, dealing with the myriad of problems that come about with a flourishing planet.</p>

<p>If you're sick of city building and just want to get out into space, these last two options will be right up your alley. Gods of Gravity launched as one of the earliest free-to-play success stories and quickly became <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-best-new-quest-2-game-of-2023-wont-even-cost-you-a-dime">my strategy game of the year</a> in 2023. It's a built-for-VR experience that sees you capturing planets to farm resources and build bigger squadrons, all with the goal of capturing all the home planets in a system.</p><p>The game is designed to be played multiplayer but a single-player campaign delivers all the strategy you want without a pesky story getting in the way. You'll play as one of several different gods, each with its own set of powers, that's able to physically grab any ship in the squadron and launch it like a dart. The strategy is real and the players will give you a serious challenge, especially as you make your way to the tournament rounds. This is Chess in Space and it evokes some of my favorite moments from Ender's Game's Command School.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Homeworld: Vast Reaches</a>. Yes, it's <em>that</em> Homeworld and it's in glorious VR and mixed reality for the first time ever. I grew up with the Homeworld games and always wondered what it would be like if I could be the one physically grabbing those ships and pointing them where to go with more than just a mouse and a keyboard. Now I don't have to wonder anymore! The mixed reality mode even puts ships and asteroids <em>in</em> my living room, making it feel even more unique.</p><p>Homeworld VR is an original story that takes place between Homeworld 1 and 2, helping fill in some gaps in the story. Don't worry if you've never played any game in the series, though! The excellent narration and beautifully illustrated story keeps you in the loop. The campaign can be finished in just a few hours and it's not as detailed or stat-heavy as the non-VR versions of the game, but I tend to find that this method works best in a headset.</p>

<ul><li>Shortly after releasing the March Feature Drop with new camera upgrades, Pixel Camera 9.8 is rolling out.</li><li>The small update includes a toggle that lets users disable animation in astrophotography shots.</li><li>It's rolling out now in the Google Play Store, but may take some time to show up for everyone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google shipped a few neat Pixel Camera features with the March Feature Drop this week, and now a new update for Pixel Camera is rolling out to match. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/pixel-camera-9-8/#more-664233" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Pixel Camera 9.8 is becoming available through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> with a few settings menu tweaks and support for March Feature Drop updates. This is a minor update, with the bulk of the new features being attributed to the most recent Pixel Feature Drop.</p><p>The highlight of the Pixel Camera 9.8 update is a toggle for "Turn on animation for Astrophotography" in the app's settings menu. Animation was already present in astrophotography shots, and this toggle is still enabled by default. However, this is the first time Google made it possible for end users to disable them. You can find the toggle by navigating to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> in Pixel Camera 9.8.</p><p>The other tweak, as noted by 9to5Google, is a change in wording for the description of the Palm Timer toggle in settings. The description now reads, "Start a photo timer by showing your palm to the front or rear cameras." Previously, it only listed compatibility with the front camera.</p>

<p>The rest of the features in Pixel Camera 9.8 were bundled with the March Feature Drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">which we have all the details on here</a>. They include Dual Screen Preview for video recording for Pixel Fold users, and Add Me support for Dual Screen Preview on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Additionally, Connected Cameras allow you to use another Pixel or a GoPro as a remote camera for livestreaming and recording.</p><p>This is the latest Pixel Camera update, and it's a relatively small one. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-a-small-pixel-camera-9-7-patch-update">last patch update for Pixel Camera 9.7</a> was also minor, and an earlier version of Pixel Camera added Quick access settings. Before that, version 9.6 added an underwater mode, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">easier astrophotography mode access</a>, and vertical panoramas.</p>

<hr>
<p>We're approaching the dreaded Daylight Savings (where we spring ahead) but, to help, Samsung is discussing a couple of new updates.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/world-sleep-day-recovering-from-daylight-saving-time-may-take-more-than-three-weeks-youngest-hit-hardest">blog post</a>, Samsung's research from 2024 showed how Daylight Savings Time (DST) affects users across varying age groups. While younger people are affected the hardest, the company says it's preparing a few updates to help all its users recoup some of that lost sleep. Samsung highlighted two major updates, beginning with "creating an ideal sleep environment."</p><p>The post announces there will be a Samsung Health app update "later this month" that brings a familiar feature: the Sleep Environment Report.</p><p>The sole purpose of this tool is to give the user "guidance" and "analysis" about where they lay their head. In short, environmental factors like the room's temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2 </sub>levels can negatively (or positively) impact your rest. All of this information is gathered by the report's integration with SmartThings. If anything is out of alignment, the Health app's report will inform you so you can make the right call.</p><p>With this en route for Galaxy phones, Samsung says not everyone will get this later in March. According to its post, the Sleep Environment Report will drop for One UI 7 devices — basically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 series</a> — for Health app versions 6.29.5 or higher. Since the report leverages SmartThings, the company says you must ensure your device is connected to it.</p><p>The second update concerns the Health app's Energy Score, detailing how far you can push yourself daily. Samsung says the update will provide a new metric: Activity Consistency. The company says it's designed to "help you understand your overall condition in greater detail." It will analyze your activity levels "over the past four weeks" to accomplish this.</p>

<p>The Sleep Environment Report will sound familiar if you checked out Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-expanding-the-galaxy-ring-in-five-important-new-ways">major Galaxy Ring announcement</a>. Not only was the smart ring available in a few new sizes, but it also grabbed a couple of new Health app features, one of which was its sleep time guidance report. The feature works similarly to what Samsung is preparing to drop for its Galaxy phones later in March. The report offers insight into your sleeping conditions to help facilitate better sleep quality using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>Also, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-wear-os-5-official-rollout">Energy Score insights</a> was introduced on the Galaxy Watch during the fall when Samsung rolled out its Wear OS 5-based update. That press release highlighted its "intuitive" nature, delivering a score based on your sleep, physical activity, heart rate, and more. When you wake up, that score will clue you into how hard you should or shouldn't push yourself.</p><p>One UI 7 devices are the only ones preparing for this update later in March. While that's a bummer, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently said</a> other eligible phones should begin receiving its major Android update in April.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is set to become one of the thinnest smartphones on the market, and making any piece of technology that slim is a balance. By making a phone slimmer, battery life and performance could drop as a consequence. Additionally, thinner devices are more likely to bend, especially if they're using the same materials and construction as their thicker counterparts — does anyone remember "bendgate" on the iPhone 6?</p><p>Luckily, it seems that Samsung is aware of the risks of building an ultra-slim smartphone and plans to attack durability concerns head-on. While Samsung has been tight-lipped regarding Galaxy S25 Edge specs, Samsung's UK Marketing Director Annika Bizon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/exclusive-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-will-have-durability-to-match-its-sexy-form">first confirmed to TechRadar</a> that durability is one of two "really exciting" features for the South Korean company.</p><p>First, Bizon discussed the accomplishment of building a flagship phone in a form factor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-is-likely-coming-on-april-16">rumored to be just 5.84mm thick</a>. "I can’t say too much, but what I will say is that [the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge] is about beautiful form factor. And there are two points I want to make,” Bizon told TechRadar. “One is that it’s absolutely stunning. And if you think about the technology that’s going into that size of space, it’s pretty impressive."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-side-comparison-01" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The side profile of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, the Samsung exec touted the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability, which is crucial for the phone to be successful. Thinner phones are widely believed to be less durable than thicker ones, and the company will need to dispel that notion to get customers to buy into the Galaxy S25 Edge's impossible form factor.</p><p>"The second thing I’ll say concerns durability. With anything slim, durability [has to come as part of the package]. Those are the two features [of the Edge] that are exciting [for us]," said Bizon in the TechRadar interview. "Well, I know durability isn't exciting — but it's really important. So watch this space, because there are some exciting things to come regarding this phone."</p><p>As has been the case with past Galaxy S25 Edge teasers, these comments about the phone's durability are quite cryptic. Fortunately, recent Galaxy S25 Edge rumors and leaks might shed some light on what durability breakthroughs Samsung is talking about. A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-edge-ceramic-build-exclusive/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> predicts the smartphone will use an Armor Aluminum frame, but in a first for Samsung, could feature ceramic on the back. At the moment, it's unclear whether the back is tipped to be fully ceramic or glass-infused ceramic.</p>
<h2 id="why-ceramic-could-be-the-perfect-material-for-the-galaxy-s25-edge-2">Why ceramic could be the perfect material for the Galaxy S25 Edge</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MpHizJuDsTHcVf3WNdiaN" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-hanging" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in person at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MpHizJuDsTHcVf3WNdiaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm inclined to believe that Samsung has a few other durability tricks up its sleeve beyond the rumored use of ceramic. That's because ceramic isn't exactly new to smartphones. Ceramic-infused glass is currently used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-gorilla-armor-2">Galaxy S25 Ultra's Gorilla Armor</a>, and it's also available as Ceramic Shield on iPhones. Additionally, longtime Android fans might remember that the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus was actually offered in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ceramic-galaxy-s10-worth-it">ridiculous $1,2500 variant with a fully-ceramic back</a>.</p><p>But focusing on the ceramic rumor reveals a few key benefits for the Galaxy S25 Edge. For starters, ceramic is stronger than glass, which would help the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability. Wireless charging also works through both ceramic and ceramic-infused glass, so that's still an option. Although the frame of the Galaxy S25 Edge is still rumored to be aluminum, a ceramic back and/or a ceramic-infused glass front could add structural integrity to this phone — reducing the likelihood of the Galaxy S25 Edge bending.</p><p>The other benefit of ceramic no one seems to be talking about is that it has a higher thermal conductivity than glass. What does this mean for the Galaxy S25 Edge? Essentially, it means heat coming from the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and the battery would be dissipated better with a ceramic back compared to glass. This could reduce thermal throttling and allow the Galaxy S25 Edge to perform well despite its constrained form factor.</p><p>Even if the rumors are true, and ceramic is the only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">durability improvement</a> offered on this phone, it could go a long way to making the Galaxy S25 Edge less prone to bending than other thin phones.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-samsung-making-a-galaxy-s25-edge-in-the-first-place-2">Why is Samsung making a Galaxy S25 Edge in the first place?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dDhXjhBherscrhAWWS3uDD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-backside-03" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDhXjhBherscrhAWWS3uDD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there's a theme with the Galaxy S25 Edge, at least from Samsung's perspective, it's limiting compromises. The goal of this handset appears to be to offer an ultra-thin smartphone with as few sacrifices as possible.</p><p>“The thing with slim phones is people want to know that they’re still getting very good technology," Bizon explains. "Innovation is in our DNA. It’s about the right timing, and when we think a product is ready to take to market, coupled with the fact that people do want form factor changes."</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for Photos that brings the return of a feature it dropped a few months ago.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/328797818/share-contents-from-other-android-apps-to-your-partner">community post</a>, the Google Photos team highlighted the return of Partner Sharing for users on Android (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-photos-partner-sharing-from-other-apps-screenshots-change/">9to5Google</a>). As the company reiterates, Partner Sharing was an easy tool users could leverage to share pictures from third-party apps. Google originally removed it with the goal of "reducing clutter" and promoting "focus" on your partner's feed.</p><p>However, a wealth of user feedback has urged Google to return it to form.</p><p>Rolling out this week, Google says the Photos app will pick up a new setting where "screenshots or saved photos backed up from other apps" are shared with your partner automatically. The post states the "other apps" specification concerns apps like social media and the like. Users will retain a bit of privacy as Google says the "Include content from other Android apps" setting is disabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, users are said to always remain in control of what third-party photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">are shared with partners</a>. Once this arrives, if you've enabled it, your screenshots and pictures from other apps will be shown to your partner. If disabled at any time, those photos will disappear from their view.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-drops-partner-sharing-support-for-photos-from-other-android-apps">voiced their opinions</a> behind Google's removal of automatic screenshot/saved third-party pictures in Photos last November. Without much warning, users noticed their screenshots were no longer appearing on their partner's feed. Google hadn't communicated the change via a Photos app pop-up. Instead, the company quitely highlighted the change in a support document.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that Google properly announced the change, stating it was for the sake of "reducing clutter."</p><p>The original reports from Reddit stated downloads, screenshots, and photos from other Android apps weren't being shared. The Google Photos update rolling out this week with the new setting should return things to how it was.</p><p>Speaking of decluttering your app, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections tab</a> in Photos was made for just that purpose. The view offered a themed view for all of your albums, like "People & Pets," "Places," and "Documents." During its arrival, the company said it wanted to "streamline" the experience for users looking to get into certain memories quickly. Elsewhere, Google kicked off its test in the U.S. for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ai-powered-search-is-here-for-a-few-lucky-souls">Ask Photos</a>," an AI-based feature that lets you talk to Gemini about your stored content.</p><p>The test kicked off last fall and, since then, the company has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ask-photos-ui-search-redesign-rollout">a slight UI redesign</a> to give users more agency.</p>

<ul><li>Google removed over 180 apps spanning across 56 million downloads, due to a massive ad fraud scheme tricking advertisers into paying for fake user engagement.</li><li>The fraudsters created vapor apps, that were disguised as genuine popular apps, that ran recurring ads making it difficult for users to delete.</li><li>The IAS Threat Lab worked with Google to identify and take down these apps from the Play Store</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on deleting a massive number of apps from its Play Store following an“extensive and sophisticated ad fraud scheme” (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/05/googles-play-store-deletion-do-not-keep-all-these-apps-on-your-phone/">Forbes</a>), that seems to have impacted over 56 million downloads that spanned across 180 odd apps.</p><p>According to the publication, it seems like Google was trying to play catch up by sending out security patches in an attempt to fix the issue that’s causing several apps to turn malicious. However, it seems like it was all in vain, and now the only way to practically fix this issue was by deleting the apps that caused it.</p><p>An Ad-fraud scheme is different from a Malware or a Firmware that takes over devices. It involves people tricking advertisers into paying for genuine user engagement in the pretext of showing these ads on real apps, however they are not actually reaching real users.  It could also show users ads extensively on the app, which will lower user experience, leading to people moving away from Play Store to download apps.</p><p>Furthermore, the publication adds that these fraudsters create something called “vapour” apps and showcase them on the popular category of the app store and users unknowingly will download these look-alike apps (like flashlights or QR code readers) but end up getting one filled with unnecessary ads. “Upon installation, these apps are often accompanied by a persistent notification, subtly ensuring their continued operation. Some of these apps have no visible icon or ‘open’ button available for the user to interact with,” Forbes added.</p>
<h2 id="how-google-tackled-this-2">How Google tackled this</h2>
<p>This not only impacts users but also genuine advertisers who are willing to shell out money to make their products more visible on the App Store. Genuine app developers who rely on advertisers for revenue are also impacted by this scheme, undermining the overall integrity of the Play Store. It seems like these apps have slipped through Google Play Protect as well,  Android’s defense against malware and permission abuse, which is essentially there to keep devices safe from harmful apps.</p><p>Finally, Integral Ad Science (IAS), a global media measurement and optimization platform worked with Google to “actively disrupt this fraudulent operation, collaborating with industry partners to minimize its impact.” As a result, Google has removed all fraudulent apps from the Play Store.</p><p>In response to IAS’ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://integralads.com/insider/ias-threat-lab-fraud-scheme-fake-android-apps/">report, </a>Google stated it is taking proactive measures to protect the Play Store from these vapor apps. “Google Play Protect will warn users and automatically disable these apps, even when they originate from sources outside of Google Play.”</p>

<p>Last year was a banner year for AYANEO, as the company released an onslaught of both Windows and Android handhelds. On the Android side, the Pocket DMG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a> were easily two of the most intriguing handhelds that we've seen in recent memory.</p><p>And now, the Pocket Micro Classic gets even closer to imitating one of Nintendo's classics. Basically, everything about the Pocket Micro and the Micro Classic is identical. This includes the Aluminum chassis, 3.5-inch IPS borderless display, and MediaTek Helio G99 SoC.</p>

<p>In case it wasn't obvious, the only key difference is that AYANEO ditched the dual joysticks from the Micro with its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handheld</a>. In doing so, it also appears to have moved the D-pad and ABXY buttons down slightly to help fill up some of the space.</p><p>With this change, the Pocket Micro Classic looks like the perfect modern successor to the original Game Boy Micro. This is especially true of the "Retro Gold" color, which features a gold front paired with a red CNC aluminum shell.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Dyoaz2YN2GpxejD36HkPx8" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-classic-promo-render-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro Classic in Retro Gold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dyoaz2YN2GpxejD36HkPx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for performance, well, it'll be identical to the "regular" Pocket Micro. The Helio G99 is paired with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of expandable storage. Meanwhile, the 3.5-inch display, with its 960 x 480 resolution, offers perfect 4X upscaling for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Advance</a> games.</p><p>Obviously, the Helio G99 is capable of playing games from systems that are far more powerful than the GBA. So what does that mean if you end up wanting to play PS1 games but don't have a joystick? AYANEO claims you'll be able to switch between the D-pad and left joystick mode by long-pressing the ST and = buttons found on the front bottom lip.</p>

<p>This isn't entirely unheard of, as there are plenty of retro handhelds that offer similar implementations. However, it will be interesting to see if AYANEO also makes this available from the AYASpace Menu in case you forget the button combination.</p><p>Currently, there are three colors to choose from, across two different RAM and storage configurations. Pricing for the 6GB model with 128GB of storage starts at $179. If you want 8GB of RAM and double the storage, you're looking at either $209 for the Magic Black color, or $239 for both the Retro Gray and Retro Gold colors. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/goods/9048974164213">pre-order one starting today</a> and AYANEO is expected to begin shipping its latest handheld sometime in the "middle of April."</p>

<ul><li>Google is testing out an expansion of AI Overviews called 'AI Mode.'</li><li>This will help users understand complex topics by generating results that incorporate advanced reasoning and thinking capabilities.</li><li>AI Overviews powered by Gemini 2.0 will now be available to teens without needing them to sign in.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/">announced</a> today that it is testing out a search mode that has the ability to answer complex questions and go beyond just a few pointers that appear with AI Overviews.</p><p>According to the tech giant this mode has, "advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities." This means when users ask questions on AI Mode, the AI chatbot will not just give you an entire page's worth of answers but will also give you follow-up questions in case you want to take the search further.</p><p>The AI Mode shows up as an additional tab/option below the Google search bar, on the left-hand side of the "All" option. According to Google, it received feedback from "power users" that they'd like to see more AI responses to their searches.  This is why the company has now started testing this model which is powered by Gemini 2.0</p><p>The difference between AI Overviews and AI Mode is that it will give you answers to nuanced questions in one go, rather than having users sieve through multiple searches. It could be particularly helpful when users are trying to do a deep dive into a new concept or when comparing varied options.</p><p>For instance, you can ask Google how Déjà vu works and how it pertains to memory, with Overviews, you only get the answer to what Déjà vu is and links to studies, however with the new AI Mode, Google explains,  it will give you several pointers on the above and also explain how the concept relates to memory. As seen below:</p>

<p>"It uses a “query fan-out” technique, issuing multiple related searches concurrently across subtopics and multiple data sources and then brings those results together to provide an easy-to-understand response," the press release added.</p><p>The images show AI mode on both browsers as well as the mobile app, hinting at a dual rollout and easier access to this feature.</p><p>As the company is still testing out this feature, it cations users that they may encounter some challenges with this and the answers may be inaccurate or even show up as the AI supporting a particular opinion, which will be addressed in the next phase of testing.</p><p>Additionally, Google announced that AI Overviews will now be powered by Gemini 2.0. Making it easier for the LLM to answer queries related to coding, and advanced math while showing Overviews for more search results. Lastly, teens can also use AI Overviews without needing to sign in/verify their age.</p><p>As AI Mode continues to be in a testing phase, and starting today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/about/ai-premium/" target="_blank">Google One AI Premium</a> subscribers can try out this experience in Labs. While we still wait for an official rollout.</p>

<p>Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Feature Drop</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">March 2025 security patch</a> for eligible Pixel phones this week, and the latter included an under-the-radar tweak that is making older Pixels run smoother. As spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3p6s9/pixels_with_tensor_cpu_get_61x_linux_kernel/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the Linux kernel on devices with older Tensor processors has been updated to the 6.1.x version (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phones-kernel-upgrade-march-update-3532360/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Previously, phones with Tensor G3 chipsets and older were running the older version 5.10.x of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">Linux kernel</a>.</p><p>This is a subtle change that could lead to big benefits for people daily driving a Pixel 6, Pixel 7, or Pixel 8 series device. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> already had the 6.1.x version of the Linux kernel, but this is the first time the newer version has made its way to a stable update for older devices. Users are noticing this tweak after applying the March 2025 update for Pixels.</p><p>One user says that "the phone feels extremely responsive compared to pre- March update," according to the Reddit thread. Another reports that they are "seeing a good boost in battery life since March update." It's unclear whether these improvements are directly linked to the kernel update, but it's nevertheless a positive sign for owners of aging Pixel phones.</p><p>Separately, another Reddit user reports that the March 2025 patch has updated the baseband version for their Pixel 8 Pro, which could lead to less background battery drain.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3p6s9/pixels_with_tensor_cpu_get_61x_linux_kernel">Pixels with Tensor CPU, get 6.1.x Linux kernel</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>You can check the Linux kernel version for your device by opening the Settings app. Then, tap <strong>About phone </strong>> <strong>Android version</strong> and find the number listed under <strong>Kernel version</strong>. If you are running a beta or developer preview build, your older Pixel device may have already updated its kernel version before the March 2025 security update.</p><p>Google's seven-year update promise hinges on it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">being able to deliver new updates to older chipsets</a>, and things like routine Linux kernel update are crucial to the company fulfilling that promise.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/kernel-upgrade-for-tensor-powered-pixel-phones">A report from January 2024</a> predicted that Google would bump the Linux kernel version of older Pixels to the 6.1.x version, and that now comes over a year later.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> offers additional capabilities beyond the free version, including higher rate limits and token counts, but many Advanced features typically hit free users eventually. Ahead of a paid feature going free, we usually see hints in the code strings of the Gemini or Google apps. In an APK teardown, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-deep-research-freemium-apk-3532290/" target="_blank">Android Authority's</a> resident code sleuth AssembleDebug thinks there's evidence Deep Research could become available in limited fashion for free users.</p><p>In version 16.8.31 of the Google app, Android Authority reports that code strings point to "a 'freemium' version of the tool" becoming available for free users in the future. Like with document uploads and file analysis, Android Authority predicts that there could be rate limits or other limitations for the free version compared to the Gemini Advanced experience. The site didn't share the exact code strings that hint at Deep Research going free.</p><p>New use cases for AI are popping up all the time, but online researching is a big one that has emerged of late. Google introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Deep Research for Gemini</a> last year, and it became popular quickly. OpenAI followed up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpts-new-ai-tool-does-the-research-so-you-dont-have-to">Deep Research for ChatGPT last month</a> in response to the craze. Both features aim to cut down the time it takes to research for a project or paper.</p>

<p>Gemini Advanced is the paid version of Gemini available through the Google One AI Premium plan. It is available for a $20 monthly subscription and also includes all the other benefits of Google One Premium. Some newer Pixel phones include free trials for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a>, putting Gemini Advanced features in the hands of more users.</p><p>However, Google has consistently brought Gemini Advanced tools to free users over time. Aside from the aforementioned document uploads and file analysis support, the company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-free-version-now-supports-saved-info-for-personalized-responses">made saved info in Gemini a free feature</a> just last week.</p><p>It's expected that like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">document uploads and file analysis</a>, Deep Research won't be fully featured for free users. Google could be trying to give free users a glimpse of what Deep Research can do as a way to upsell them to Gemini Advanced. Right now, this is all speculation, so we'll have to wait and see what comes of Deep Research for free users.</p>

<p>Google's Pixel Watch engineers collaborate with cardiologists and other clinical experts to improve their sensor data, while relying on AI and algorithms to give the next best thing to your doctor's advice. So I had Google's senior clinical lead explain how her medical expertise factors into your wearable tech — and where things are headed next.</p><p>I spoke with Dr. Jacqueline Shreibati, a practicing cardiologist and adjunct faculty at Stanford University who previously served as Chief Medical Officer at AliveCor, a startup dedicated to AI insights from mobile EKGs.</p><p>Aside from serving her patients, she guides the consumer health team consulting on health projects like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">Loss of Pulse</a> at Google. She is "embedded" in a "shoulder-to-shoulder process" with Google's engineers when envisioning new health features, while also connected with the external cardiologists and practitioners who test these tools before they ever show up on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>.</p><p>I asked Dr. Shreibati how they convert <em>ideas</em> like Loss of Pulse into actionable features, how wearables will transition from "wellness" devices to "medical" devices, how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> factors into the discussion, and what to expect next from Pixel Watches.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-process-to-make-loss-of-pulse-detection-possible-2">The long process to make Loss of Pulse detection possible</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qNznnDDzozunWqLVQgAEiF" name="google-pixel-watch-march-feature-drop-loss-of-pulse-detection-example" alt="Loss of Pulse on the Pixel Watch 3 will call emergency services if it cannot find your pulse." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNznnDDzozunWqLVQgAEiF.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in the United States, at least half aren't witnessed, meaning the chance of survival is "extremely low," Shreibati explained. The idea was to add a virtual witness to change the equation.</p><p>They knew that a Loss of Pulse feature "lined up at a high level" with Pixel Watches' current capabilities — optical heart rate and emergency SOS — but the "real work" began with figuring out how to catch it accurately without false positives. That's where Shreibati's expertise came into play.</p><p>Google says it tested Loss of Pulse's algorithm over "hundreds of thousands of hours," using tourniquets for artificial pulselessness or putting watches on patients in a cardiac electrophysiology lab who were scheduled to have "induced" no-pulse procedures. This gave Google's "AI-powered algorithm" the data it needed for accurate Loss of Pulse readings.</p><p>Google knows it needs these kinds of external tests but relies on cardiologists like Shreibati to facilitate them, as she can think of methods and scenarios that Google engineers can't. For example, Shreibati talked about using stunt actors to simulate the falls people might experience during cardiac arrest, giving your Pixel Watch another point of data with its accelerometer.</p><p>I asked Shreibati why this feature took so long to arrive in the United States, since Europe got Loss of Pulse back in September 2024. She answered diplomatically that "each regulatory body has its own process," and that the FDA's rigorous (or simply slow) testing period is "not within our control."</p><p>So when we see Fitbit patents like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-arterial-stiffness-monitoring-patent">detecting arterial stiffness</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbits-soon-gain-ability-monitor-your-blood-presure">measuring your blood pressure</a> that are years old, it doesn't necessarily mean that Google has abandoned the idea. It could simply be a matter of needing years-long testing to make sure the feature is accurate enough to pass FDA scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id="replacing-extrapolation-with-personalization-2">Replacing 'extrapolation' with 'personalization'</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wrote in a previous column how tech brands are pushing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">transition from "wellness" to "medical" devices</a>, going beyond advice on general energy levels and sleep quality to actual diagnoses. So I questioned Dr. Shreibati on Google's perspective on this trend, as well as her own.</p><p>The typical clinical approach, she explained, is to use population-level guidelines to calculate your risk scores for conditions like heart disease; it's more about extrapolating than <em>knowing</em>, at least until you go through diagnostic tests.</p><p>But the Google engineers she works with think that you should know your "personalized risk using data rather than extrapolation," combining your wearable health data with your medical records for more advanced, preventative insight before you ever step in a doctor's office.</p><p>We're starting to see hints of this with features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea detection</a>, but when it comes to detecting more serious heart health conditions, "We're not there yet, but that's the goal," Shreibati says.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-us-fda.jpg" alt="Samsung announced it has gained U.S. FDA approval for its sleep apnea detection." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sleep apnea detection on a Galaxy Watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of that comes down to using machine learning algorithms to connect the dots between data and conditions, but it'll require "rigorous validation and verification" before wearables can offer that kind of insight in consumer apps. After all, misdiagnosing someone could lead to serious anxiety and expensive check-ups.</p><p>In theory, though, Google's clinical team seems to believe that Gemini insights will make a difference in terms of accurate medical recommendations in the future.</p><p>When I asked Shreibati about the potential for diagnoses from wearables to become a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-challenge-of-using-smartwatches-and-smart-rings">source of anxiety and fatalism</a>, she argued that it's a matter of determining your "relationship with the data." Early warnings of potential issues can be "empowering," but they have to think about the <em>frequency</em> of how often a watch warns you about things before it becomes "distracting or overwhelming."</p>
<h2 id="using-your-watch-to-get-healthier-2">Using your watch to get healthier</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3061px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5" name="pixel-watch-3-myfitnesspal-app" alt="The MyFitnessPal app on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3061" height="1722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone immersed in both cardiology and the tech world, Dr. Shreibati would have a unique perspective on the whole premise of wearables: To use health and fitness data to guide a healthier lifestyle. So I asked if she had any advice for Pixel Watch owners.</p><p>She responded by pointing out how the Fitbit app has customizable goals for a reason: whether you should focus more on weight, sleep stress, VO2 Max, or heart health will vary by person to person.</p><p>Without specific data, she can only focus on "the things we know we all have to do." In her mind as a cardiologist, that's getting sleep, making time to be physically active throughout the day, eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, and monitoring important stats like your blood pressure and weight.</p><p>In terms of future potential Pixel Watch features to help you get healthier, she talked about Fitbit "exercise plans," which could potentially build on the daily recommendations you get based on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit cardio load</a> for more long-term guidance.</p><p>She also mentioned using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> to increase the amount of data that Fitbit (or Samsung Health) have access to, with blood pressure as her example. It's much more important to <em>have</em> that data from medical-grade sources for their machine-learning algorithm, rather than wait for smartwatches to start tracking blood pressure, glucose, and other stats accurately.</p>
<hr>
<p>The one question Dr. Shreibati couldn't answer was how Google claims to make its heart rate algorithm more accurate year over year while using the same sensor hardware — as that's not her area of expertise.</p><p>I received the following response from a Google spokesperson: "We are able to drive these improvements with a deeply research-based approach, combined with expertise in machine learning, to push the boundaries even further." This was more marketing than explanation, but does emphasize how much ML work goes into making Pixel Watches more accurate.</p><p>Generally speaking, I found the interview quite enlightening. I've seen how these companies hire doctors who then attest to the accuracy of these devices, but only now do I have a clearer sense of how they fit into the wearable pipeline. They envision big-picture ideas and work with engineers to figure out what's "technically feasible," as Shreibati put it, and then communicate with doctors and patients outside of the tech sphere to see how the ideas work in practice.</p><p>My next Google interview will be with a sleep expert on their team, so feel free to drop a comment if you have any questions about sleep tracking — or questions I missed about heart health data that you'd like me to forward along!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google took home two of Global Mobile's (GLOMO) most prestigious awards at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-wins-glomo-at-mwc-barcelona-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, March 5. Google's Pixel 9 Pro won the major "Smartphone of the Year" award, which is the brand's second win in a row for that category. Additionally, Google's work in AI was honored as Gemini won the "Breakthrough Device Innovation" award.</p><p>Last year's winner for Smartphone of the Year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-series-wins-best-smartphone-at-mwc">was the Google Pixel 8 series</a>, and that victory was crucial for both the brand and Android phones as a whole. It was the first time an Android handset had secured the pivotal award since 2021. Now, Google has managed to achieve the feat in two straight years, claiming the "Best Smartphone" title last year with the Pixel 8 and now the renamed Smartphone of the Year award with the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> wins the 2025 award, it's important to remember the criteria for eligible devices. "The Best Smartphone award combines outstanding performance, innovation and leadership as determined through assessment of smartphones on the market during the period <strong>January 2024</strong> <strong>to December 2024</strong>, by world leading independent analysts, journalists and influencers," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/mobile-awards/categories-and-awards" target="_blank">according to GLOMO</a> (emphasis theirs).</p><p>Like usual, that means the Pixel 9 Pro competed with the likes of the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, but did not face the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's</a> award for Breakthrough Device Innovation represents the second time the honor has been given to a software feature. The last time that happened was in 2023, when Apple won it for Emergency SOS via satellite. The award is described as being "for core hardware and software innovation within smartphone devices themselves."</p><p>Google won half of the total awards available in the "Device" category of GLOMO's honors at MWC 2025, in a significant milestone for the company.</p>

<hr>
<p>We've gone more than six months since Google released its next-gen streaming device, but new confirmation states global markets will miss it.</p><p>In a conversation with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-availability-apac-3531912/">Android Authority</a>, Google's VP of devices and services for APAC, Mike Abary, informed the publication that several Asian countries won't see the TV Streamer. When the box launched last year, we delivered pricing for it and its scheduled availability for U.S. consumers. However, according to Abary, Google is paying close attention to overseas "competition."</p><p>Abary states the company has no plans to bring the Google TV Streamer to Taiwan, Malaysia, India, or Singapore. There are reportedly plans to keep it from even more APAC countries, too.</p><p>Specifically, Abary told the publication Google "evaluates the market" and pays close attention to "opportunities." To Google, the regions it will keep the TV Streamer from have "strong competition" regarding smart TV devices and their market prices. It seems Google doesn't feel it's worth introducing an entirely new product to places with a saturated market, thus it will them with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Chromecast dongle</a>.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/google-tv-streamer-regions-india-apac/">9to5Google</a> notes, the Chromecast dongle is no longer available in India or Singapore via the Google Store. Consumers there are left with third-party retailers if they're interested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CmihoNf7sLuELLGY4jvxTV" name="google-tv-streamer-chromecast-with-google-tv-2.jpg" alt="Chromecast with Google TV on top of Google TV Streamer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmihoNf7sLuELLGY4jvxTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Closing Abary's short discussion, it's reported that Google has "no plans to discontinue" its Chromecast dongle from those areas.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">TV Streamer</a> launched last August, doubling as a streaming box <em>and </em>a smart home hub. With twice the storage of the Chromecast dongle, the TV Streamer delivers 32GB of space with 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos sound options. There's even a bit of Gemini on there to help surface any shows and movies you may want to see alongside curated content.</p><p>Since it's launch, the TV Streamer has picked up a couple updates regarding its audio, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">namely its first</a> from November. This patch gave users an easy way to select their preferred audio output format. Disregarding the "automatic" option, users can choose between Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Digital, and PCM Stereo. Hopping into <strong>Settings > Audio options > Output format </strong>will get you started.</p><p>Then, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tv-streamer-update-seemingly-kills-dolby-truehd-dts-hd-formats-for-good">with another update</a> in February, Google crucially removed the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio codecs for the TV Streamer. It seems Google removed these two since they weren't available or functional for consumers. Both codecs were detectable by the TV Streamer, but nothing more.</p>

The short video showcases Gemini's microphone icon on the bottom right of the (simulated) Android Auto display. Tapping it brings up the "Ask Gemini" banner with its colorful band beneath. The AI seems alert to take random app requests for things like music from Spotify.</p><p>Gemini responds quickly and surfaces the music app on the left side of the display in its respective card.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tipster questions Gemini about the Taj Mahal, to which it begins to run through its history and designer. While not shown in the demo, AssembleDebug states Gemini's conversational abilities "shined." Moreover, they state Gemini dives into information more with questions such as this, rather than remaining brief.</p><p>Where Gemini supposedly needs work is with its travel planning feature. The tipster gave the AI the following example: "plan a trip to Indore under 10,000 rupees." Once accepted, Gemini oddly runs through a "budget friendly trip," which is just a series of price breakdowns for "transportation, accommodation, food, and sight-seeing." Gemini didn't explain anything. Instead, it ran through these key trip aspects without divulging more about what method of transportation or what hotel you'd stay at; things which are important.</p><p>It's not until the end that Gemini finally gives something on topic. The AI says traveling to Indore by train is the "most economical option." However, it doesn't dip into the pricing and instead drops that on the user's lap.</p><p>It's highly likely Google is still working through the kinks with Gemini on Android Auto. There's still no telling when this could roll out as the company continues development.</p>

<p>The idea of Gemini nestled into Android Auto has been floating around since the tipster first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-live-android-auto-integration-potential">discovered its code</a> last September. What was found concerned Gemini Live's supposed upcoming integration with the automobile software. While barebones, the code offered a glimpse into its "query" functionality and "Start Conversation" feature.</p><p>A "GeminiLiveAssistantAction" string was spotted but, unfortunately, the code didn't give much more.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-appears-to-be-expanding-its-horizons-beyond-just-cars">a recent dive</a> into Android Auto v13.5 showed Google is likely planning to extend the OS to more vehicles. The update included icons for motorcycles as one Indian bike brand was located within its code. A separate discovery highlighted Google's work to improve the visual appeal of Android Auto by supporting higher resolution displays.</p><p>Let's also not forget that Android Auto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-highlights-android-updates-mwc-2024">received some AI assistance</a> during MWC 2024. Drivers can take advantage of its ability to summarize lengthy texts for you and suggest "relevant" replies that you can tap while on the go. However, with Gemini seemingly on the way, it seems Google is looking to bring more AI usefulness to drivers, like Android phones.</p>

<p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 distills everything that Samsung has learned designing foldable phones into one great device. The hinge is durable and satisfying to use, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset never skips a beat, and you get instant access to all of the latest Gemini and Galaxy AI software features. You also get great battery life, two AMOLED displays, and 12GB of RAM straight out of the box. </p><p>On the other hand, focusing on refinement also means that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 plays it pretty safe. You don&apos;t get the same top-of-the-line performance that you&apos;d find with, say, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and the increase in price also means that the Z Flip 6 is considerably more expensive than its biggest rival, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a>. That being said, if you&apos;ve had your eye on Samsung&apos;s foldable for a while and you have something to trade in, this is one of the best Z Flip 6 deals we&apos;ve seen since Black Friday, so jump on it while you can!</p>

<ul><li>Google highlights the rollout of a Labs experiment for the Shopping tab on mobile, which lets users "create" a piece of fashion and match it to real products.</li><li>The virtual try-on feature for clothes expands its coverage to include skirts and pants, as well as an update to its AR beauty makeup tool.</li><li>Last March, Google rolled out style recommendations for users, including accessories and other additions for the best fit.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's AI continues to spread its influence across its ecosystem, and a new update brings more to online shoppers.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/ai-vision-match-ar-beauty-virtual-try-on/">blog post</a>, the company highlighted three updates to the ways AI will impact the Google Shopping experience. The first update involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-shopping-tools">a Labs experiment</a> gone live called "Vision Match," which lets users leverage Google's AI image generation for clothing discoveries. According to the post, users on the Shopping tab (in Search) on mobile will soon find a "Can't find it? Create it" button.</p><p>This will ask users for a prompt. Google's given example reads "colorful midi dress with big daisies." The AI will generate a series of dresses that match your description; however, it will also surface a "similar-looking products" section. Google says this feature was created because shopper feedback showed most users "struggled" to find what they envisioned.</p><p>This is rolling out today (Mar. 5) to mobile devices in the U.S. Google recommends users begin their shopping search as normal, with as many details as possible. After, if you're unable to find what you're looking for, scroll down and look for the AI prompt.</p><p>Additionally, Google says it's expanding its virtual try-on reach to include pants and skirts. This update is rolling out today for mobile and desktop users. From the Shopping tab, users can tap on a "try on" button if it's a brand the company supports. Joining this update is a full body view as Google says it's "upgraded" its machine learning to show the virtual model's entire figure instead of just their top half.</p><p>Users can see how a skirt or pair of pants fit on people ranging from size XXS to XXL.</p>

<p>Google's final rollout involves the ability for users to virtually try on beauty products using its AR software. While this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-ar-shopping-features-help-you-avoid-picking-the-wrong-product">initially rolled out</a> three years ago, the latest update today brings beauty looks with "multiple products" inspired by celebrities, influencers, and trends. The post says you can surface a "See this look on you" button by searching for celebrity makeup looks or themed looks like "spring makeup."</p><p>The button will take users to a dedicated page with their camera active in the center on mobile. Tapping "try it on" will virtually plant the makeup style over your face. What's more, users can swipe through all related beauty looks, which will seamlessly appear over your face.</p><p>Google says this is rolling out this week to U.S. consumers.</p><p>Users may remember the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-clothes-virtual-try-on">original rollout</a> of seeing clothes on virtual models from 2023. The AI try-on feature was quite limited, only giving folks the option to see women's tops from brands like Anthropologie, LOFT, H&M, and Everlane. Moreover, users were only given a brief look at the person and their body shape from their torso and nothing else.</p><p>The recent update gives you a full head-to-toe look, so you're not in the dark about anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, an update last March brought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-shopping-tools">more personalized experience</a> to Google Shopping. At its core, the update highlighted style recommendations based on what users are searching and prefer. Google is said to remember your preferences for future searches to pair appropriate accessories and more with your clothes.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is rolling out a Lite Premium plan for users in the U.S., which allows people to browse non-music videos ad-free.</li><li>Costing $7.99 per month, this plan seems to be separate the existing YouTube Premium which costs $13.99, and YouTube Music.</li><li>The streaming platform is said to expand its tier to other countries in the near future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is basically splitting up its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-canceled-spotify-and-used-youtube-music"> YouTube Premium </a>tier and YouTube Music to bring a new ad-free subscription for those who don't use the app for music videos.</p><p>"We've focused on giving subscribers a variety of ways to enjoy their favorite content, and Premium Lite is the latest step in that evolution," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/">YouTube stated in a press release.</a></p><p>The streaming platform added that it will finally expand its new ad-free tier, Premium Lite to users in the U.S.  Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-finally-uncouple-youtube-premium-and-youtube-music-with-premium-lite">began testing</a> Premium Lite first in Australia, Germany, and Thailand, and users who subscribed to it could see reduced ads on their app. This means the ad showed up as either a banner or before the video played, without interrupting their entertainment.</p><p>"With Premium Lite, users can enjoy their favorite content with fewer interruptions," YouTube said in the release.</p><p>When users subscribe to Premium Lite, they will get to watch the majority of the videos on YouTube like gaming, cooking, and news ie., any non-music videos will show up without ad interruptions at a minimal cost of $8 a month. However, they will have to give up the ability to download videos offline and background play.  And here's what the new tier could look like:</p>

<p>This Lite version could come as a significant downgrade for people on the usual Premium plan, but it could work out great for those who don't watch as many music videos with a free YouTube subscription. Additionally, it brings several Podcasts and playlists without any interruptions for those who primarily use YouTube Music Premium for the above, at a lower cost.</p><p>It is important to note that this tier was initially introduced in 2023 and was later discontinued in October of the same year as the company wanted to push users to get the Premium plan.</p><p>Talking about YouTube's Premium Lite, Android Central's Michael Hicks said he would definitely be signing up for it since, "It comes for about half the price it costs now, even if it means missing out on offline downloads and other experimental, Premium-only features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">4X-speed videos and higher-quality audio</a>."</p><p>While YouTube says that users will start seeing this option pop up today, it seems like it is yet to show up for Android Central's team based in the U.S. However, Google says it won't be restricting this rollout to the U.S. and will make this tier available to all users in other pilot countries as well.</p>

<ul><li>New leak points out that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will come with a unique camera design, ditching its usual 'folder' look.</li><li>Renders from Onleaks indicate that the cameras will be embedded within the cover display of the device, much like the Moto Razr 2024.</li><li>The clamshell's will sport a 50MP primary lens and 12MP ultrawide camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent leak showed up online indicating that Samsung's next clamshell, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be ditching its usual camera design for something more seamless.</p><p>According to renders shared via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak">Android Headlines</a> and avid tipster OnLeaks, Samsung will be letting go of its usual folder- like design that houses camera on the back of the cover screen. Instead it will be integrating both lenses into the display—sound familiar? We thought so too.</p><p>The clamshell could end up looking like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr 2024</a> model, which also has a similar camera array embedded into the cover display. Previous rumors indicate that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will come with a slightly larger 4 inch cover display (previously 3.6) , which now makes sense as it allegedly intends to house its camera in it. The renders of the device indicate that it will have a more end-to-end cover display surrounding the cameras.</p><p>While this could be a small change, it becomes more significant as it changes the entire look of the clamshell that the company has stuck to with the past generations.</p>

<p>Additional specs of the device have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-rendering-changes-specs-leaked">leaked</a> early this week, that indicate the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be powered by Samsung's in-house Exynos 2500 chipset to improve efficiency of the device. Other than that, it will be sticking to its 50MP primary lens along with a 12 MP ultra wide lens.  The internal end-to end screen will also be slightly bigger when compared to its predecessor, measuring 6.8 inches.</p><p>Additional rumors indicate that the price of the device would fall under the same $1,099 bracket and would come both 256 and 512 storage option. If Samsung follows the Galaxy Z Flip 6 course, then it could be currently gearing up to showcase the Z Flip 7 at its summer Unpacked, set to take place in July. While these rumors sound too good to be true, they should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung hasn't changed things too much with its foldables, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> has a new design and better internals, it still has the same foibles as its predecessors — average battery life, cover panel that isn't wide enough, and a highly visible crease along the middle of the inner panel. <br><br>Samsung is likely to address at least one of those issues with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Samsung Display showcased its creaseless panel at MWC 2025, and it might make its way into this year's foldable. Samsung Display is a different entity to the Samsung that makes phones, but the latter always sources panels from the panels, and now that the creaseless panel is ready, it's a good bet that this is what will end up in the Z Fold 7.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BLRATuYVeoaZBd2daBhDnD" name="Samsung Crease Less Panel" alt="Samsung demoing a crease less panel next to Galaxy Z Fold 6 at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLRATuYVeoaZBd2daBhDnD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung Display highlighted the new panel next to the regular Galaxy Z Fold 6, and there is a huge difference. The new panel doesn't have anywhere close to a visible crease, and it is similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>. Samsung's foldables have always felt outdated, with Chinese manufacturers consistently able to deliver thinner and lighter designs while managing to have a less visible crease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qJZd5myoJw587E2eWJYymD" name="Samsung Crease Less Panel" alt="Samsung demoing a crease less panel next to Galaxy Z Fold 6 at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJZd5myoJw587E2eWJYymD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At least in this regard, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 should hold its own against what Chinese manufacturers are offering in 2025. The new creaseless tech isn't anywhere as shallow as the standard inner panel of the Z Fold 6, and while I wasn't able to use the device in question, there was a clear difference in just looking at the two panels next to each other.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vRvaEHaRLDfu8kR3Gv8vmD" name="Samsung Crease Less Panel" alt="Samsung demoing a crease less panel next to Galaxy Z Fold 6 at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRvaEHaRLDfu8kR3Gv8vmD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Knowing Samsung though, there isn't a guarantee it will actually use the panel, so we will have to wait until the Z Fold 7 rolls out sometime later this year. All signs point to a launch sometime in the month of July, but that hasn't been confirmed yet — we should know more in the coming weeks.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumor has it that Google Gemini Live could be built right into the Galaxy S25’s lock screen, so you'll be able to use it instantly without even unlocking your phone.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-on-now-bar-3531781/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, a recent leak from X user @TechA7mad hints that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> could let you use Google’s Gemini Live voice feature straight from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar interface</a>.</p><p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">latest and greatest Galaxy phones</a> come packed with some pretty smart AI features, including the Now Bar. Think of it like Apple’s Live Activities, giving you quick, automatic updates right when you need them.</p><p>The Now Bar feature sounds great in theory, but in practice, it’s pretty limited. At the moment, it mainly works with Samsung’s own apps and just a few third-party ones like Spotify, which holds it back from being more useful.</p><p>Bringing Gemini Live into Samsung’s Now Bar looks like Google’s way of making the feature more useful. At the same time, Google is tweaking its UI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-hold-hang-up-buttons-3523189/" target="_blank">switching to a call-style layout</a> on Pixel phones and the Gemini app for Android and iOS to make it more user-friendly.</p><p>According to the tipster, the Now Bar will show Gemini Live’s status in real time, like whether it’s listening or on pause. The appearance of an ‘On hold’ status in the interface hints that you might be able to chat with the AI straight from your Samsung’s lock screen without interruptions.</p>

<p>On top of Gemini Live, Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-prepares-one-ui-7-wider-rollout">Now Bar also links up with Google Maps</a>, giving you turn-by-turn directions and extra helpful information right when you need it.</p><p>For Google Gemini and similar AI tools, the big goal is to become a seamless part of your daily mobile routine. This upcoming Now Bar feature is a clear step toward making that happen.</p><p>There’s no exact date yet for when this cool Google Gemini-Now Bar combo will roll out widely, but it’s definitely on the horizon.</p>

<p>Google is integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and other AI features across all its platforms, but some have been quicker to receive them than others. Google TV is the latest operating system to be overhauled with AI, and Google has plans to expand ambient screensaver functionality while also adding Gemini Live support in the future. But it's asking Google TV users for advice on how to do that, according to a new survey sent out to Google TV Advisors.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-advisors-club-survey-gemini-live-news-briefs/#threads" target="_blank">Android Police</a> got its hands on the survey, which concerns News Briefs and Gemini Live on Google TV.

If you have 7 minutes, please take this survey, and we’ll enter you in our monthly sweepstakes for a $50 gift card."</p><p>The full survey is listed below, courtesy of Android Police.

<hr>
<p>Samsung will publicly release One UI 7 starting in April 2025, the company announced today in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-rolls-out-more-galaxy-devices/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general" target="_blank">press release</a>. The launch month is expected to be the conclusion of a lengthy development and rollout process, which included a beta program that started in December 2024 and has seen multiple delays. The company will introduce three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta programs</a> before the official rollout, for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>Users became antsy for One UI 7 to hit older devices after it debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series earlier this year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">arrived on the new budget Galaxy A series just last week</a>.</p><p>Now, the company is confirming that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-could-get-a-one-ui-7-beta-soon">a One UI 7 beta program for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will become available starting this week. To join the One UI 7 beta program, you can apply in the Samsung Members app with an eligible device. Act fast if you want to try it, because Samsung eventually closed sign-ups for the One UI 7 beta program on the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>After expanding to the 2024 lineup of Galaxy foldables, Samsung will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-builds-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s23-spotted-on-test-servers">bring a One UI 7 beta program to the Galaxy S23 series</a> and the Galaxy Tab S10 series. Just like for the other Galaxy devices, users can register for the beta program in the Samsung Members app. The company notes that the beta will be available in India, Korea, the U.K., and the U.S., and that "availability may vary by device model and market."</p><p>Samsung explains in the press release that One UI 7 integrates "leading AI agents with multimodal capabilities into every touch point of the interface."</p><p>Notably, the company also reminds users in the footnotes that Galaxy AI features are only going to be provided for free until the end of 2025. Samsung could always extend that timeline, but it's starting to look like it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-ai-subscription-is-no-different-than-what-apple-and-google-are-already-doing">might charge for Galaxy AI at some point</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">After numerous delays</a>, users of older Galaxy devices are finally in the home stretch, as Samsung confirms that One UI 7 will reach public availability and stability next month.</p>

Samsung boosted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6's</a> battery capacity by 300mAh last year, and a new report suggests that it'll do the same for the next generation.</p><p>The Dutch publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-7/" target="_blank">Galaxy Club</a> is reporting that a new set of batteries could raise the total typical capacity for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> from 4,000mAh to 4,300mAh (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-could-fix-its-predecessors-biggest-weakness/">Android Police</a>). Due to the small form factor of Galaxy Z Flip devices, Samsung uses a split structure with two separate battery cells on these phones. Galaxy Club says that the bigger battery will have a 2,985mAh rated capacity and the smaller one will have a 1,189mAh rated capacity.</p><p>You might have noticed that those two cells add up to a total rated capacity of 4,174mAh. That's because batteries can be measured in rated and typical capacities, and the latter is the one Samsung uses to make its marketing claims. Galaxy Club notes that the current Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a rated capacity of 3,887mAh, but is advertised as having a 4,000mAh typical capacity.</p><p>As such, the publication expects Samsung to use a similar disparity between its rated and typical values, and that's how it ended up at the 4,300mAh figure. This 300mAh increase in capacity would be a big achievement for Samsung and the Galaxy Z Flip 7. It would be the first time a Samsung clamshell-style foldable offered more capacity than a base-model Galaxy, since the Galaxy S25 has a 4,000mAh capacity.</p>

<p>The report also predicts that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be equipped with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor</a>, which aligns with other rumors. While the latest Qualcomm chipset is more powerful, this variant was co-designed with Samsung. That could mean that a more efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chip paired with a larger battery might significantly improve battery life.</p><p>A previous leak predicted the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could have a "longer battery life" as it will "consume less power" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-efficiency-battery-life-changes-rumored">thanks to a new, more efficient display</a>. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to release sometime this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>OPPO has been basking in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> spotlight, after it showed off the world's slimmest foldable and now, is jumping onto the next big thing—AI.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-ai-tech-summit-mwc-25/">announced</a> its AI- strategy in collaboration with Google today at the MWC in Barcelona and is promising to bring monthly AI updates to its phones.</p><p>In a press release, the company elaborated on how it will make these updates a reality. It said that Google will be at the center of its on-device AI, meaning Gemini will be able to communicate across OPPO's native apps like Notes and Calendar. OPPO's devices that are compatible with AI will get these new capabilities, thanks to the current Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash.</p><p>"We are excited to collaborate with OPPO to shape the future of mobile AI by bringing together Google technologies with OPPO's exceptional hardware and software," said Matt Waldbusser, managing director for Global Solution and Consumer AI, Google Cloud.</p><p>Talking about its AI strategy, the company says it's working on establishing three key areas that focus solely on AI Productivity, AI Creativity, and AI Imaging which will help build better AI features for existing and future OPPO devices. That said, efficient AI programming needs an equally efficient and powerful chip. So, the company will also be collaborating with MediaTek which will bring optimized chips to OPPO's AI table.</p><p>This collab is said to bring "AI-enhanced photography to next-generation gaming experiences, from intelligent security solutions to seamless device connectivity," the press release added.</p>

<p>Speaking about monthly updates, the company is promising to bring at least one new AI update to compatible devices. While we don't have much information as to when they will be rolled out, the company said  "AI Search and integration of OPPO applications with Google Gemini are coming to the OPPO Find N5 soon."</p><p>Lastly, features like AI Call Translator, which interprets calls in multiple languages in real-time, and AI VoiceScribe which summarizes information across voice calls, are said to show up in future updates.</p><p>While the Find N5 is the only device mentioned in the above update, it remains to be seen if these features will grace other OPPO devices as well.</p>
