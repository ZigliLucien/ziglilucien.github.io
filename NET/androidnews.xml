It now appears the company may have cleared the biggest hurdle blocking the phone's U.S. availability.</p><p>When the OnePlus 15 launched on November 13, 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">OnePlus told us</a> the phone wasn't arriving in the U.S. alongside the rest of the world due to the lack of FCC clearance.</p><p>For those unaware, every electronic device sold in the U.S. must be cleared by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) before it can be sold to customers. This ensures the device meets government radio and communication standards.</p><p>However, due to the government shutdown from October 1, 2025, to November 12, 2025, OnePlus couldn't get official FCC approval for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>. Even though the phone had already passed testing at all FCC-recognized labs, the final approval from the U.S. government was pending. It now appears that approval has come through.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-finally-gains-fcc-approval-2">OnePlus 15 finally gains FCC approval</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-05" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As spotted by a user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1p7vyyu/oneplus_15_just_got_certified_by_fcc/">Reddit</a>, the FCC granted a certificate to OnePlus for a smartphone carrying the model number "CPH2749" on November 25, 2025. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fccidlookup.com/fccid/2ABZ2-OP24865">official document</a> doesn't mention the OnePlus 15 by name, this model number lines up with the device.</p><p>For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> model number in India is CPH2745, while the FCC listing shows CPH2749, which should correspond to the U.S. variant.</p><p>This theoretically means OnePlus has now obtained all required certifications to launch the phone in the U.S. OnePlus previously said that once approved, the company would try to bring the phone to "customers in the U.S. expeditiously," but we haven't heard anything official yet.</p><p>That said, we do know the OnePlus 15 will cost $899 in the U.S. once it launches officially. We're now just waiting to hear from the brand on when that will actually happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Perhaps the most notable thing about this cheap tablet is that it's one of the few economy-level Samsung tablets that also comes with the first-party S Pen, despite not carrying a premium-level price tag with it.</p><p>The S10 Lite has a 10.9-inch display with a 2112 x 1320 resolution, as well as a battery life of up to 16 hours per charge. This particular deal is for the base-level 128GB storage configuration, though it also comes with a microSD port for added storage, or you can upgrade to the 256GB version.</p><p>The S10 Lite may not be included in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> index, partially just because there are so many other high-powered options out there.

The DH2300 has an elegant design, Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, plenty of power, and great software.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need M.2 storage.</p><p>Honestly, UGREEN knocked it out of the park with the DH2300. The NAS gets a new design that looks elegant, and it's extremely easy to install hard drives inside the enclosure. The NAS is powered by a Rockchip platform, and it does a great job in regular use — I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><p>While it may not have some of the extras that you see on higher-end models — like M.2 SSD slots — the DH2300 is astonishingly good. If anything, the 4GB of RAM and the internals mean it isn't anywhere as limited as you'd imagine a NAS in this category to be. Realistically, if you're just looking to store your phots and videos from your phone and other data, there isn't a need to get another NAS; the DH2300 does a terrific job in this area, and you even get NFC pairing that lets you connect your phone.</p><p>The software has plenty to offer as well, and you even get container management, so you can easily install any utilities that aren't provided by default. Having tested many entry-level models over the years, the DH2300 has proven to be a revelation, and it is without a doubt the best starter NAS around today.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DH2300-2-Bay-Capacity-Diskless/dp/B0FNWHSPXF">price coming down to $167 for Black Friday</a>, there's just no reason not to get this NAS if you're looking to get started with a home server.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, there's one Black Friday tablet deal in particular that stands out, as the Lenovo Tab One is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/"><strong>on sale for 50% off</strong></a> over at Best Buy.</p><p>Take one look at Lenovo's tablet lineup, and it's basically an encapsulation of the wide variety that Lenovo offers as a company. It all starts with budget-friendly options like the Tab One, but with a Black Friday deal like this, we're venturing into "impulse-buy" territory.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ" name="lenovo-tab-one-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo Tab One (4GB/64GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.99</del> <strong>$79.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>It's not often that I feel comfortable recommending a tablet under $100, but the Lenovo Tab One is the exception to the rule.

However, the problem with those super-cheap Fire tablets is that they lack the performance to really do much more than use one app at a time.</p><p>Thankfully, Lenovo's Tab One doesn't suffer from those problems thanks to the MediaTek Helio G85. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room for those who plan to use the tablet for more than just media consumption. And if you need more storage, there's a microSd card slot, which is just one of those "nice to have" features.</p><p>That said, this tablet is also great for catching up your favorite movies or shows with an 8.7-inch 1340 x 800 display. Lenovo also equipped the Tab One with Dolby Atmos-tuned dual speakers, providing a kind-of surround sound experience. Plus, the 5,100mAh battery is rated to last for over 12 hours on a single charge, which is better than much of the competition.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Speaking of deals, some of the newest e-readers from Amazon, launched in July, are already heavily discounted. For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G"><strong>the latest Kindle Colorsoft is available at a 32% discount</strong></a>, bringing the price down to $169. Plus, you can get it at an even better price by trading in an old Kindle for an extra 20% off!</p><p>I've been trying to squeeze in some reading early in the morning or late at night when everything's quiet, so this new Kindle has definitely caught my eye since it came out. I'm currently using the 2021<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-long-does-battery-kindle-paperwhite-last"> Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and I'd totally love a massive color upgrade. Imagine a new Kindle that not only keeps the screen glare-free but also adds a pop of color to those graphic novels! It's been this weird little thing—I really want the cover of the book on my Kindle to actually have color, making it feel like I'm holding the real copy, and I think this is as close as it gets.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.99%;"><img id="MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW" name="Kindle-Colorsoft-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="888" height="879" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99"><del><strong>$249.99</strong></del><strong> $169.99 on Amazon</strong></a></p><p>At just $169, you’re getting the full Colorsoft experience—vibrant book covers, color-coded highlights, and readable comics—without the "early adopter" premium.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is reportedly making its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">Circle to Search</a> feature simpler to use with this nifty new feature. The tech giant seems to be testing a change that invokes AI Mode at the bottom of the screen, which makes the Google Search bar appear.</p><p>For instance, you're looking up some shoes you spotted on Instagram, earlier Circle to Search would show you the best results that match your search, along with links to the product. But if you need to do a follow-up search, then you'd have to use the search bar at the top to type in your query.  And this may be changing.</p><p>The new interface is said to simplify follow-up queries on Circle to Search(as spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/circle-to-search-ai-mode/"> 9to5 Google</a>). It will feature a Google Search bar at the bottom of the screen, displayed alongside the initial search results. This allows you to easily look up additional information while keeping the first set of results visible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1688px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4fE623DoUWDd5V4P5mdEvV" name="Circle-to-search-AI-Mode" alt="Google is quietly testing this nifty feature on Circle to Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:2,l:9,cw:1657,ch:932,q:80/4fE623DoUWDd5V4P5mdEvV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1688" height="950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5 Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI Mode is activated by tapping "Ask anything," which features a microphone icon for voice input. This experience includes a 'plus' menu for accessing Nano Banana, and a set of suggested queries that keep the existing "Circle to Search" context. Once a prompt is entered, the user is directed to the full AI experience.</p><p>This looks a lot like the experimental pill-shaped bar that Google was testing way back in 2021 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-bottom-search-bar-redesign-on-android">popping up again in late 2024. </a>Google was trying out a bottom-positioned search bar with a cool new Material 3 design to make the Android app better, and now it seems to be showing up in Circle to Search, too! That said, this feature appears to have shown up on the latest Google app beta (version 16.47), and it isn't available to the wider audience as yet. It remains unclear if and when Google will start rolling out this update.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Why did the search bar move to the bottom?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The move is likely designed to improve one-handed usability and to signal a shift to "AI Mode." Previously, the search bar was at the top of the screen. By moving it to the bottom, it mimics the layout of other conversational AI tools and allows you to view the initial image or text results (which stay visible) while typing or speaking your next question.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

But my fellow reviewers and I had to acknowledge how expensive they all were, with mid-range models priced like flagship watches and the most expensive ones costing as much as a great smartphone.</p><p>Black Friday (temporarily) solves this, bringing the prices down to what they <em>would</em> have cost if Garmin acted like other smartwatch brands and treated upgrades as the norm, not an expensive add-on perk. In particular, the $100-off Forerunner 570 is an excellent deal, bringing the price down to what its predecessor originally cost.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-570-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-aluminum-indigo-aluminum-2025/JXF9YFFYHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2wmCnKAxA2f7swJjXjurCP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wmCnKAxA2f7swJjXjurCP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="920" height="920" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 is a fantastic running and multisport watch. Compared to the excellent <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review" data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99">Forerunner 265</a>, its AMOLED display is 0.1 inches larger and twice as bright, you get a distinct aluminum bezel instead of plastic, and its next-gen HR sensors are more accurate with skin temp included. </p><p>It only weighs 3g more than before despite adding a mic & speaker for calling, and you get new software perks like a Triathlon coach and evening report. For most Garmin fans, most of the upgrades are nice to have, but not essential, so this Black Friday deal will make the upgrade more tempting.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-570-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-aluminum-indigo-aluminum-2025/JXF9YFFYHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Likewise, it's much easier to recommend the Instinct 3 AMOLED now that its price has fallen to $399 ($100 off). As much as its sporty design and up to 24 days of battery life will appeal to die-hard Garmin fans, its price was a bit too high considering you don't get "unlimited" battery life or offline maps. Now, it matches the Instinct 2 series' original pricing, while giving you new perks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="410ff070-5c86-45c6-b575-b9212d19d0f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Instinct 2 Solar" data-dimension48="Instinct 2 Solar" data-dimension25="$349.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-instinct-3-gps-smartwatch-45-mm-amoled-black-with-black-band-2025/JXF9YF5WX9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tTMFynRu5L4r6db3T3zGRn" name="garmin-instinct-3-amoled-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTMFynRu5L4r6db3T3zGRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>You can choose between a 1.2- or 1.3-inch AMOLED display with excellent battery life or <em>months</em> of battery life with the MIP version, with its upgraded Solar panel that turns time outdoors into extra lifespan.

It's <em>really</em> hard to recommend at the original $800 price, but at $200 off?

My previous one was showing its age, so I replaced it with the Sony Ult Field 1, and it's been one of the best purchases I've made.</p><p>The speaker is surprisingly light, so I can either carry it with the built-in strap or stuff it in a bag. It has a durable design, so you don't have to worry about having it out at the beach. I also appreciate that it has buttons so I can control the volume and easily pair it to new devices.</p><p>For a relatively small Bluetooth speaker, it's surprisingly loud. I've had it at a few outdoor gatherings, and it's more than enough to keep small and mid-sized groups entertained. It sounds great and has plenty of bass, but you can also up the bass if need be by pressing the Ult button. I rarely find that I need to do this, but bass heads will definitely appreciate the kind of sound you can squeeze out of this small speaker.</p><p>And while sound is already pretty good, you can pair the speaker with a second Ult Field 1 to achieve a true stereo experience. I only have one, but with a deal this good, there's little reason not to get a second speaker.</p><p>You'll also appreciate the long battery life. I've rarely found myself running the battery down, even after seemingly using the speaker for what feels like an entire day. And if you find you need a charge, you can always whip out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/anker-nano-power-bank-a1638-hands-on">portable power bank</a> to keep the party going.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon's Black Friday Week sale has chopped $100 off the Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth speaker</strong></a>, which is our pick for the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker out there for Android users.</p><p>This is the second generation of the Sonos Move speaker, and the company launched this one with improvements to battery life, connectivity, and sound quality overall. The Move 2 comes with a USB-C port for charging, though it also comes with a convenient charging stand for the first time in the company's history of audio products.</p><p>To be sure, the Move 2 is much larger than many of today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>, and while it does have a handle, it's not quite as portable as some with more stowable shapes and sizes. Still, if you don't need it to be super small, it might be worth considering, especially if you want something that can achieve rich bass tones, crisp vocals, and a broad frequency range backed by a high-performance, precision-tuned woofer.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.00" data-dimension48="$499.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:842px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.15%;"><img id="weSqAchKKwjinzt4f7RrTo" name="sonos-move-2-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weSqAchKKwjinzt4f7RrTo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="842" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.00" data-dimension48="$499.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$499.00</del> <strong>$399.00 for Amazon's Black Friday Week</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped $100 off the price of the Sonos Move 2 speaker for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, bringing the price of what is our favorite Bluetooth speaker from an audio quality perspective down to just $399. If you're looking for something tiny and portable, this probably isn't the way to go.

Additionally, the Sonos Trueplay tuning features adaptive sound for a multitude of environments, meaning that it will tune the audio to your surroundings when listening.</p><p>While Google Assistant is not available on the Sonos Move 2 due to legal disputes between the two companies, it does offer other voice assistants, including the first-party Sonos Voice Control and Alexa.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Also, Power Saving Mode works only while driving, so it doesn’t support walking or cycling navigation.</p><p>Power Saving Mode offers a simpler, low-power version of turn-by-turn navigation. So if you’re on a long drive and your phone’s battery gets low, this smarter mode could help — unless you’re using an older Pixel or another Android device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9" name="google-maps-psv" alt="Google Maps' power-saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="it-shows-only-what-actually-matters-2">It shows only what actually matters</h2><p>Google’s solution uses a feature called AOD Min Mode, which lets Maps run full-screen on the Always-On Display. Instead of bright colors and animations, you see a dim, monochrome view with a slow refresh rate and a simple interface. It only shows what you need: your next turn, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-chip-to-show-time-to-get-home">estimated arrival time</a>, distance, and little else. Traffic overlays, color-coded roads, constant zooming, and street-name clutter are all removed.</p><p>The actual trigger is simple. Start turn-by-turn navigation, tap the power button, and your phone flips into this low-power mode. The result is a navigation feed that consumes significantly less battery, with Google suggesting you could squeeze up to four extra hours on longer trips. That’s huge for anyone who relies on Maps during commutes or out-of-town drives, especially when you’re nowhere near a charger.</p><p>For Pixel 10 users, Power Saving Mode is already enabled by default. You can turn it off in Google Maps settings if you prefer the full, colorful navigation view.</p><p>If the company does expand it — and it should — this could become one of the most useful navigation features to hit Maps in a long time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And if this one isn't your cup of tea, then you might be interested in the Backbone One, which is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8/" target="_blank">on sale for $20 off</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$169.99" data-dimension48="$169.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mVVD2mU992evSbFhexJoZM" name="backbone-pro-controller-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVVD2mU992evSbFhexJoZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Backbone Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$169.99" data-dimension48="$169.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$169.99</del> <strong>$134.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>As someone who has more controllers than they care to admit, the Backbone Pro is one that I keep coming back to.

I've always enjoyed the previous Backbone One controllers, but after gaming for just 15-20 minutes, my wrists feel like they're on fire. The Pro solved that problem, so now, the only time I experience discomfort is when I get lost playing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/one-of-my-favorite-single-player-xbox-games-just-dropped-to-a-rock-bottom-price">Megabonk</a> or Hades II for too long on my phone.</p><p>Ergonomics aren't the only reason why you should consider a Backbone controller, however. Namely, battery life is rated for up to 40 hours on a single charge, which is important if you're playing a game you just can't put down. Backbone also has a unique "TouchSync" feature built-in that makes its controllers compatible with practically all of the best Android games, even if they don't already have native controller support.</p><p>Backbone might not be as popular of a company as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/i-keep-coming-back-to-this-controller-from-razer-and-its-a-whopping-50-percent-off-for-black-friday">Razer</a> when it comes to controllers, but it's actually been around for a few years. Since the release of the original Backbone One, we've seen a few iterations released for both iPhone and Android phones. In just 2025, Backbone has released the Backbone Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/backbone-pro-xbox-edition">Backbone One Xbox Edition</a>, an awesome Death Stranding 2 special edition controller, and the Backbone Pro Xbox Edition.</p><p>So while it might not have as many options to choose from compared to a company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/i-used-gamesirs-latest-budget-mobile-controller-and-it-has-a-lightweight-design-with-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, Backbone is definitely picking up a head of steam. And for good reason, as these are some of the most well-built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">controllers</a> that I've ever used, to the point that I've never had any issues with any of my Backbone controllers over the years.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-27">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You can do this through the Meta Horizon app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight">Android</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-horizon/id1366478176">iOS</a>) that's used when setting up a new Meta Quest, or go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://auth.meta.com/">Meta's login page</a> and create a new account from there. Only use this account on your Meta Quest and don't follow the tantalizingly easy prompts to log in with one of your other Meta accounts.</p><p>Existing users should head on over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://accountscenter.meta.com">Meta accounts center page</a>, tap <em>Accounts</em> under Accounts settings on the left menu, then remove any accounts that are linked to the Meta account you use on your Quest.

This is a wonderful service that's also a useful way to ward off account breaches since someone would have to have access to your "master" account in order to access linked accounts.</p><p>But because of the way Meta handles linked accounts through its many products and services, one banned account means you lose all access forever. Yes, that even means you'll lose access to games you've purchased since those digital licenses are tied to that account.</p><p>It's heinously stupid and unfairly punishes too many people, since there are plenty of known instances of people's Facebook accounts being erroneously banned. Things are made worse by the fact that companies like Meta, Google, and others don't normally have a way to talk to a human being without jumping through tons of hoops.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iAYhZL8GUav5GAdEUncVCH" name="meta-quest-3s-carrying" alt="Carrying the Meta Quest 3s with a YOGES 3rd party head strap installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iAYhZL8GUav5GAdEUncVCH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wish Meta handled things differently or, at the very least, gave Meta Quest users a way to offload their purchases onto another account if something happened with a <em>linked</em> account. While some people certainly deserve to be banned from using Facebook forever because of bad behavior, it doesn't make sense to take away all their purchases from an unrelated gaming console like a Meta Quest in one fell swoop.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many Meta Quest users have faced this terrible reality and, more often than not, it causes them to swear off the Quest forever. I certainly can't say I blame them, but you can learn from their unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>Trying to get a trillion-dollar company to change things like this is difficult, if not impossible.

The two fitness smartwatches are each priced at $550, placing them in the mid-tier segment. The next step up in price puts buyers firmly in premium territory, with the Garmin Venu X1 costing $800 and the Forerunner 970 going for $750.</p><p>Still, the question of whether to put your $550 toward the Garmin Venu 4 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> is a perplexing one. While the Forerunner is better for running, as the name suggests, it's lacking in other areas compared to the Venu. When you consider the Venu 4 can also handle basic run tracking, it's easy to start looking at that Garmin smartwatch as the more versatile option. Let's compare all the differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a> and the Forerunner 570 to help you decide which one to buy.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-forerunner-570-design-and-display-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Forerunner 570: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="9RK6UG4akMTuTibR5p6zuQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-23" alt="Garmin Venu 4 watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RK6UG4akMTuTibR5p6zuQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the Garmin Venu 4 and the Forerunner 570, you'll immediately notice that these two smartwatches feature completely opposite design styles. The Forerunner 570 is colorful and lightweight, foregoing premium materials like stainless steel in favor of lightness. The flashy, bright colors make it excellent for visibility and good looks while running, but limits how well the Forerunner 570 can dress up.</p><p>On the other hand, you have the Garmin Venu 4 with a stainless steel and fiber-polymer case, plus a fully stainless steel bezel. It looks more premium, with flat sides, fewer buttons, and muted colors. The Venu 4 is also smaller, both in overall footprint and thinness. It's available in both 41mm or 45mm sizes, offering 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch displays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="npdwsn9vEgdjmiT2LcBJRH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-09" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 on black shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npdwsn9vEgdjmiT2LcBJRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the Forerunner 570 also offering 1.2-inch and 1.4-inch displays, it's larger, with 42mm and 47mm case options. Each watch sports an AMOLED display with a high peak brightness rating of 2,000 nits.</p><p>The watch is slightly thicker, at 12.9mm compared to 12.5mm. However, it's also lighter, which is crucial for a running watch. The 42mm model weighs 42 grams and the 45mm weighs 47 grams, including the strap. By comparison, the Venu 4 weighs 46g and 56g for its small and large size offerings, respectively.</p><p>Both ship with silicone sporty straps, but use standard 20 or 22mm watch bands, so they're fairly easy to swap out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4157px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ir5YSSTcPP2Ge9ouCq4j9Q" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-13" alt="Garmin Venu 4 flashlight on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ir5YSSTcPP2Ge9ouCq4j9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4157" height="2337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the back, both Garmin watches feature a health sensor and the company's proprietary charging connector.

Each device has a 5ATM water-resistance rating and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-forerunner-570-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Forerunner 570: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-08" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of hardware, the Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor is the core of both the Venu 4 and Forerunner 570. The upgraded sensor suite includes a more-accurate heart rate monitor, plus extras like a skin-temperature sensor and blood-oxygen sensor. The features are inconsistent across the devices, though.</p><p>For example, despite both watches using the same Elevate v5 sensor, only the Venu 4 can access the ECG app for electrocardiogram readings. Additionally, it's harder to access skin-temperature graphs on the Forerunner 570 compared to other watches, like the Venu 4.</p><p>Both watches have versatile connectivity tech inside, including Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC, which enables device sync and features like Garmin Pay. There's more storage than before, as the Forerunner 570's onboard space has been upped to 8GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 4</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 570</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 41 x 41 x 12mm</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 45 x 45 x 12.5mm</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 42.4 x 42.4 x 12.9mm</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47 x 47 x 12.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Materials</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Case: </strong>Stainless steel and fiber-reinforced polymer</p><p><strong>Bezel: </strong>Stainless steel</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Protection</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, Gorilla Glass 3</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5 ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 46g</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 56g</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>:<strong> </strong>42g</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 1.2-inch (390x390)</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 1.4-inch (454x454)</p><p>AMOLED touchscreen, 2,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 1.2" (390 x 390)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 1.4" (454 x 454)</p><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery life</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm: </strong>10 days (3 w/ AOD), 15 GPS hours, 13 All-Systems GNSS hours, 12 multi-band GPS hours</p><p><strong>45mm: </strong>12 days (4 w/ AOD), 20 GPS hours, 19 All-Systems GNSS hours, 18 multi-band GPS hours</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 10 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-only GNSS mode)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 11 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-Only GNSS mode)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Sensors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, ECG, gyroscope, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Tracking</strong></p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, All-Systems GNSS + Multi-Band</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>LED flashlight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The software experience on the Garmin Venu 4 and the Forerunner 570 is quite similar, and it's improved compared to past Garmin — and especially Forerunner — models.

The larger sizes of the  Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 can last up to 11 or 12 days, respectively.

As mentioned, the Garmin Venu 4 is better for advanced health metrics, with full support for heart-rate monitoring, blood-oxygen sensing, skin-temperature readings, and ECG recordings. The Forerunner 570 can handle some of those, but not all of them. Considering most mainstream smartwatches offer all those features these days, it's perplexing the Forerunner 570 doesn't.</p><p>The Forerunner 570's five onboard buttons make it easier to use for high-intensity interval training than the Venu 4. Both watches have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">Garmin Run Coach</a>, which can help you train for your next race with personalized workout plans. There are new sport types available on either watch, with over 80 total to choose from.</p><p>In terms of specialized run features, the Forerunner 570 offers AutoLap by Timing Gate detection, Projected Race Time predicting, and Suggested Finish Line estimates. For serious runners, these can be seriously cool — AutoLap can detect a race's course markers and automatically snap your GPS signal to them, ensuring accurate recording of a crowded race with wide routes.</p><h2 id="which-should-you-buy-2">Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DeL3BAmBLwJzc6RF8SASBH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-15" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 on a dumbbell with Training Effect stats on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeL3BAmBLwJzc6RF8SASBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most fitness buffs, the Garmin Venu 4 is the better way to spend your $550. It has the same Garmin Elevate v5 sensor you'll find inside the Forerunner 570, but the Venu 4 adds ECG support. On top of that, there are perks like a built-in LED flashlight that make the Venu 4 more helpful on a daily basis. With a stainless steel bezel and a refined case designed, the Venu 4 doesn't look out of place when work as an everyday smartwatch.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Garmin Forerunner 570 is a specialized option for serious runners only. If you're the kind of runner that needs five tactical button for precise and quick mid-run controls, grab the Forerunner. The same goes for anyone that cares about the Forerunner 570's lightweight design and strap compared to the Venu's thick and heavy design.</p><p>I'd buy the Forerunner 570 in a heartbeat, because if I ever step foot in a gym, it's to get on a treadmill. Many weightlifters and strength trainers are the opposite — their workouts are done in gyms and on mats. For those buyers, or anyone that wants a full-size smartwatch that can pass with workwear or athleisure, the Venu 4 is the best option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2e4cfc6d-242e-4dfb-aa80-50b067263938">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Premium health watch</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Venu 4 is a unique offering for people that need more advanced health and fitness metrics than the average smartwatch provides, but isn't a specialized runner, hiker, or cyclist.

Not only does family get together to celebrate and watch football, but it also means that Christmas is right around the corner. It also means we're bound to see some steep discounts on some of our favorite devices, like being able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL/"><strong>save $400 on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></a>.</p><p>Most of the time, we don't see very many discounts on Samsung flagship devices once pre-orders have ended. Because of that, it makes seeing deals that much more enticing, and it doesn't get much better than this Black Friday deal. The best part about this deal specifically is that you can save hundreds on Samsung's latest foldable from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL/">Amazon</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7-1tb-unlocked-jet-black/JJGRF3XK25/sku/6635745">Best Buy</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-256gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966udbaxaa/">Samsung</a>, as opposed to only being available at just one or two retailers.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (256GB): $1,999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (256GB): $1,999.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pfXzq95Y8KUyfSR29U4WqB" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfXzq95Y8KUyfSR29U4WqB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (256GB): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL/" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (256GB): $1,999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (256GB): $1,999.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,999.99</del> <strong>$1,599.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Samsung resolved many issues we had with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 looks and feels more like a true flagship foldable phone than ever before.

What we got was the thinnest foldable on the market, and that includes devices released abroad like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>.</p><p>While Samsung went in-house with the Exynos 2500 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/whoa-the-years-best-galaxy-z-flip-7-black-friday-deal-just-dropped-from-a-very-unlikely-source">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the company stuck with Qualcomm for the Fold 7. As such, we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at the helm, which is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This top-spec model is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7-1tb-unlocked-jet-black/JJGRF3XK25/sku/6635745">on sale for $400 off</a> as part of the Black Friday festivities.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, not only did Samsung introduce a completely overhauled design, but we also got a long-overdue camera upgrade. Samsung finally ditched the 50MP wide-angle lens from years past in favor of a 200MP sensor. This is joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto sensor with a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>In fact, the 200MP camera is the same sensor that you'll find in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is an enormous upgrade. If you're interested in seeing how the Z Fold 7 performs, we compared it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-camera-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>In our review, we gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> a 4.5/5 star rating, making this an easy recommendation for anyone who is interested in picking up one of the best foldable phones.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-32">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While other Android flagships embraced triple-digit wattage, the Galaxy S series seemed content to linger at 45W. That's changing soon, if previous leaks and rumors are anything to go by, and we now have new information about the new branding that will mark this power-up.</p><p>New findings inside early One UI 8.5 firmware, uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/super-fast-charging-3-0-3619931/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, reveal a charging system labeled “Super Fast Charging 3.0." Earlier rumors claimed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-series-may-finally-boost-charging-speeds-for-a-faster-user-experience">Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature significant charging upgrades</a>, with 60W wired and 25W wireless charging, and this new branding may be tied to those upgrades.</p><p>For a company that has stubbornly stuck to 45W speeds on its flagships while competitors sprinted toward 80W, 100W, and beyond, this is the strongest sign yet that Samsung knows it needs to catch up.</p><p>Samsung’s Ultra models have used the same 45W “Super Fast Charging 2.0” branding since the S22 Ultra, even as more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable Android phones</a> adopted much faster standards. That meant Galaxy owners were stuck with longer top-up times if they used their phones heavily.</p><h2 id="internal-proof-2">Internal proof</h2><p>Over the past few months, leaks suggested the S26 Ultra would finally get an upgrade, but nothing looked concrete until this new charging label appeared buried in Samsung’s own software. The internal code shows a higher charging “level” than the current 45W tier, and that’s hard to interpret as anything other than Samsung preparing to push past its long-standing limit.</p><p>While these numbers aren’t as high as those of some other brands, Galaxy users could finally get a faster charging experience. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PEgdznsUz" target="_blank">reliable leaker</a> previously said that it might be possible to reach 70% to 80% in about 30 minutes and cut down the time for a full charge, as long as Samsung manages heat and power well.</p><p>Galaxy owners have complained about slow charging for at least three generations, so an upgrade like this would be welcome news for long-time users. And while it’s not official yet, the firmware code leaves little doubt. If the S26 Ultra really jumps to 60W, Samsung won’t suddenly win the fast-charging race, but it will finally stop losing it by default.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the lawsuit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251124006331/en/Lieff-Cabraser-and-Kaplan-Gore-Announce-Filing-of-Federal-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Google-Over-the-Defective-Google-Nest-Hub-Google-Nest-Hub-Max-Google-Nest-Mini-and-Google-Nest-Audio-Devices">Business Wire</a>), both sides state that the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio have become faulty and have otherwise "malfunctioned" over the years.</p><p>The lawsuit lists a few issues, such as the aforementioned devices no longer "respond to even basic verbal questions." Not only has the Q&A portion of these Nest devices failed over time, but the plaintiffs state "widespread complaints" have been reported from consumers regarding failure to "interpret or act on voice commands, returning irrelevant information, losing internet connectivity despite a stable WiFi connection, and failing to recognize registered user voices."</p><p>The plaintiffs are calling this a "consumer case," one that aims to receive some sort of compensation for those who purchase these devices that have deteriorated drastically.</p><p>The report explains that user reports indicate that those who've purchased these devices have been forced to stop using them, since their main/primary function no longer works. The lawsuit argues that Google's unwillingness to fix these devices has caused consumers to spend "hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars."</p><p>The Business Wire post cites Darren Kaplan from Kaplan Gore, who states, "However, rather than getting 'smarter' and better over time, these Google ‘smart’ home devices get worse at their core function of analyzing and processing voice commands."</p><h2 id="we-can-follow-this-trail-2">We can follow this trail...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:799px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL" name="Google-Nest-Hub-Max-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="799" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lawsuit also states that Google has been aware of these problems, considering users took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice their complaints. The company responded in kind; however, nothing worthwhile has come of that.</p><p>This federal lawsuit is quite timely, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests">Google's been struggling</a> with its Nest devices since January. Reports from the start of 2025 highlighted problems with voice commands, like "What's the weather," as mentioned in the lawsuit. Speakers and displays were involved in this (just like the lawsuit mentions), but Google stated a fix was rolling out, as user reports flooded all channels.</p><p>However, that wasn't the end of it. Jumping to July, and we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-finally-heard-your-nest-and-assistant-frustrations-promises-a-fix">still heard reports</a> of users grappling with unaware and unattentive Nest devices. Users were so incredibly frustrated and raised their voices loud enough that Google's head of Home and Nest went on social media to personally speak with them. At the time, Google "promised" a fix, but there was the impression that a solution wasn't going to arrive until the fall.</p><p>Given the fact that this class action lawsuit has been served, it doesn't look like things have gone according to the original plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've been using them as my primary earbuds for more than a year, and at this price, they're easily one of the best buys you can make this holiday season.</p><p>Right now, Amazon is offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGKMZBZC/"><strong>Pixel Buds Pro 2 for just $134</strong></a>, which is about 40% off their original $229 price.

Having used them for over a year, they're the only pair I carry thanks to their lightweight and compact build that doesn't protrude much from the ears.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f6356178-8f29-4e5f-a503-6e60fd6cf221" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $95 off, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new pair of earbuds.

In addition to this, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer excellent ANC and a comfortable fit for long listening sessions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you use an iPhone as your primary device or require constant multipoint Bluetooth switching between non-Google devices.</p><p>The twist-to-fit design ensures the Pixel Buds Pro 2 stay in place even during intense workouts or runs. The ANC on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is also one of the best I've used. It's not quite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3-level</a>, which practically silences everything around you, but it's definitely better than most options you can get in this price range.</p><p>Plus, if you use Gemini frequently, these earbuds support Gemini Live out of the box, meaning you can have a live conversation with Gemini directly through your earbuds. One of my absolute favorite features is Conversation Detection, which automatically reduces the volume whenever you're speaking so you don't have to remove an earbud to talk to someone.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phone</a>, you'll enjoy the tight integration since these earbuds appear directly in Bluetooth settings, where you can adjust touch controls, ANC modes, and firmware updates. They work just as well with other Android phones from OnePlus, Samsung, or Motorola, too. You'll simply need to download the Pixel Buds app from the Play Store during setup.</p><p>If I had to nitpick, it'd be that these earbuds don't play perfectly with an iPhone. While most Google services work on iOS, Google hasn't made a Pixel Buds Pro 2 app for iPhone. You can still pair and use them, but there's no dedicated app to control features.</p><p>That said, at this price, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> feel like an absolute steal. I recommended them even at their original $229 launch price, but at nearly half off, they're a must-buy.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has a stranglehold in North America, and that's largely down to the manufacturer cozying up with phone carriers a decade and a half ago. The result is that the brand utterly dominates sales, to the extent that it is seen as the default Android choice when mulling a new purchase.</p><p>This has led to Samsung coasting in recent years, rolling out what is basically the same phone year over year. Thankfully, other manufacturers do things differently, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in particular has been a real standout this year. The phone has a stunning design, monstrous internals, battery life that will make every Samsung user envious, cameras that hold their own against the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a better AMOLED panel.</p><p>In short, the OnePlus 13 is a much better phone than anything Samsung has to offer at the moment, and the best part is that because it's been out for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3?th=1">discounted to $699 right now</a>. Without overstating things, this is the best phone you can get for this amount, and nothing else outshines it — even the newer OnePlus 15. Why should you trust me? I test nearly a hundred devices over the course of any given year, and I used all mainstream phones released in 2025.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dcb744de-3e5e-4396-a44e-7db2a32cb0e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $699, there really isn't any other device that gives you the same caliber of hardware.

The OnePlus 13 has excellent fluidity, amazing internals, standout battery life, and great cameras.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want a good phone, and want to continue using whatever Samsung comes out with every year.</p><p>Even after nearly a year of availability, the OnePlus 13 is a terrific phone. The hardware has no signs of slowing down whatsoever, and it continues to be incredibly fluid in regular use — both at mundane tasks as well as gaming.</p><p>The design has aged well too; the unique leather texture is great to hold and use, and I like that it isn't as grainy as usual leather, instead featuring a softer finish. The in-hand feel is excellent, and even though it has a 6,000mAh battery, it isn't that heavy.</p><p>On that note, battery life is excellent, and I still get a day's worth of use. The AMOLED panel is among the brightest, and you get a level of fluidity that you just don't see on most devices today. It doesn't miss out on any of the extras either, and you get a charger in the box.</p><p>Best of all, the cameras are fantastic; the Hasselblad tuning makes a real difference, leading to photos with great dynamic range and color vibrancy. If anything, I like the OnePlus 13 to the OnePlus 15, and it's much better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and every other Samsung phone. So if you've been a long-time Samsung user and want something better, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">get the OnePlus 13 while it's still at $699</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 5,000mAh model in particular conveys this well; at just 7.6mm, it is thinner than your phone, and it attaches magnetically without any issues. In fact, I only use the 10,000mAh model as I need a bigger battery — otherwise, I would have used the 5,000mAh power bank all the time.</p><p>Also, the 10,000mAh model gets Qi 2 integration, so if you have a phone like the iPhone 17 or the Pixel 10, this is the ideal power bank to use with those devices. Both power banks get a USB-C charging port to connect to a phone the old-fashioned way, and they deliver fast charging too — the 5,000mAh model does 20W over USB-C, and the 10,000mAh model hits 27W.</p><p>You get 15W charging when used in the default magnetic configuration, and I found that to be adequate in daily use. It's just convenient to just have the power bank connected to the phone and charge it, and the metal design is built to last — I've used both power banks extensively in the last six months, and there have been no problems whatsoever. So if you need a new power bank, I'd recommend getting the Qi 2 10,000mAh Picogo — it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Certified-Wireless-10000mAh/dp/B0DY7J8HPQ">fantastic deal at $36</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I used Hue, Xiaomi, Yeelight, Nanoleaf, and just about every other smart lighting brand (most of which you've never heard of) in the last decade, and when Govee came along, it was a revelation.</p><p>I have over 30 Govee products in the house, and they're all terrific. To say that I like the brand's products would be an understatement, and in over three years of use, I haven't had any issues with the brand, which is something I can't say for any other smart home brand.</p><p>To get to the point, Govee excels at outdoor lights, and the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 are among its best. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Permanent-Waterproof-Halloween-Assistant/dp/B0D14WP9TB">100-feet model is now down to $199</a>, down from its usual retail price of $329, making it a standout deal if you're looking to set up holiday lights.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b25170a9-b343-41dd-9c4a-0473b1c9cd96" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="There's no doubt that Govee does the best outdoor lights, to the point where other brands (hello, Hue) are now emulating what it's doing just to get in on the action.

Honestly, Govee is the best at this, and its outdoor lights have a level of customization that you just don't get with any other brand.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want even more LEDs (I don't blame you). If that's the case, you should consider the brand-new Prism Outdoor Lights, which are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">also discounted heavily right now</a>.</p><p>I used the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 when they launched, and they're terrific to use. They don't take much effort to install, and you get high-quality LEDs with good brightness and color vibrancy, and the Govee mobile app is a slam dunk — it just has so much customization that you won't end up using all the features.</p><p>There isn't much else to talk about. The lights are housed in an IP67 water-resistant shell, and they held up without any issues in India's monsoon, so you should have no problems whatsoever in this area. Also, it's evident that these lights are a big hit; Govee sells a metric ton of these, and while the brand wouldn't give me sales numbers, it indicated that it created a new division solely focused on outdoor lights, so it's clearly dominating in this category.</p><p>I'll admit that the latest Prism Outdoor Lights are even better as they have a trio of LEDs within each light, but they're costly — even with the discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">they're at $399</a>, or double the price of the Outdoor Light 2. If you don't need the absolute latest, the Outdoor Lights 2 will serve you very well, and at $199, there really is no reason not to buy these lights ahead of the holidays.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The QC Ultra has a neutral sound that allows instruments and vocals to shine, and you still get engaging bass that's full of vibrancy. The noise isolation is among the best of any headset, and I honestly just use the headset without even playing any music at times while on a flight.</p><p>There isn't much different with the QC Ultra Gen 2, and that's how you know its predecessor is truly noteworthy. Bose didn't change the design or sound tuning, instead adding USB-C audio — a nice-to-have feature — and increasing the battery life to 30 hours. Now, the QC Ultra is decent enough in its own right, lasting 24 hours on a full charge, but having that little bit extra makes a difference on intercontinental flights — as I found out on a recent visit to Mexico from India.</p><p>Now, having used both headsets extensively this year, I'd suggest just getting the QuietComfort Ultra; it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489">much better deal at $298</a>, and you're not really missing out on much. If you need the absolute latest from Bose, the QC Ultra 2 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0FDKR293G">obvious choice at $399</a>. With that done, I'm going to return to my in-flight movie.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One of those is the Marshall Emberton III; while it's significantly smaller than the Kilburn or Stanmore, it still somehow retains the classic Marshall styling, and it also has terrific sound quality.</p><p>It usually costs $179, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">now available for $149</a>, which makes it a great choice if you need a new Bluetooth speaker that sounds as good as it looks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="594adde0-3a5b-48c2-b3ae-55a816bbebe1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Although it may not be a huge discount, the $30 savings makes the Emberton III that much more affordable, and that's always a good thing.

You can take this speaker anywhere, and while it doesn't look that big, the sheer volume of sound coming out of this thing will astonish you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need 3.5mm out; Marshall doesn't have this mode on the Emberton III.</p><p>The Emberton III does a great job bringing Marshall's signature design to a smaller size. It is just as easy to take on the road as other portable Bluetooth speakers, and it doesn't weight that much. The distinctive styling gives it an advantage, and yes, I know that the design by itself doesn't mean much, but I like the way the Emberton III looks quite a bit, and it's one of the reasons why I use it.</p><p>Then there's the sound; I use the Kilburn II and Stanmore in my house, and while I didn't think the Emberton III would get anywhere as loud, I was astonished by its sound quality. It has an engaging bass and clear mids, and it gets loud enough even in a mid-sized room that I don't bother taking any bigger speakers these days. Oh, and battery life is pretty great too, and I only charge the unit once a week.</p><p>It also gets physical controls via a jog-wheel, and that's another thing I like a lot. There's IP67 dust and water resistance as well, and on the whole, the Emberton III has proven to be nothing short of incredible in the three months I used it. So if you need a new Bluetooth speaker, I'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">suggest just getting this one while it's at $149</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A network attached storage server allows you to store all vital data in a centralized location, and you can also use it as a media server.</p><p>I tested dozens of NAS models over the last decade, and I now manage over 500TB of data in total. In the last two years, I've been using UGREEN's NAS servers like the DXP4800 Plus and DXP6800 Pro. UGREEN is a new entrant in this category, but it made waves thanks to its strong hardware offerings, and the DXP4800 Plus is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best NAS models you can buy today.</p><p>While the NAS usually costs $699, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">now down to just $559</a>, bringing it down to its lowest price yet.

The DXP4800 Plus comes with 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, all the ports you need, and it has hardware transcoding.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software. UGREEN is doing much better in this area now, but UGOS still has some way to go.</p><p>Obviously, the hardware is the biggest selling point of the DXP4800 Plus. UGREEN somehow managed to deliver the best hardware in this category, and having this level of power in a 4-bay NAS is just great. The 12th Gen Intel platform does a terrific job, and you get hardware transcoding, a must-have if you use Plex and need it on older devices.</p><p>The 8GB of RAM and built-in SSD that houses the OS is good to see, and you get four HDD bays, two M.2 slots, and a metal chassis that's built to last. Another differentiator is 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, ensuring the NAS easily holds its own for several years to come. What I also like is that there's 2.5GbE connectivity alongside it.</p><p>I also like the sheer customizability. If you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS, and that's just highly convenient. This is a big deal, and it makes using the DXP4800 Plus that much more enticing, as you can easily switch out the software — this isn't the case with most NAS brands.

The Sony WH-1000XM4, which were first released back in 2020, have been my ride-or-die cans for years now, and even though I have newer headphones with more high-tech features and arguably better sound, I simply can't quit my XM4s. </p><p>Of course, I'm not completely nuts, so I wouldn't suggest buying the Sony WH-1000XM4 at full price these days.

Powerbeats started it off in the early 2010s and have evolved into the Powerbeats Pro 2, which launched earlier this year. Then, in 2021, Beats expanded its workout earbud lineup to include the smaller, more versatile Beats Fit Pro. That model was just upgraded and rebranded to Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>The new features and name changes confirm what we already knew — Powerbeats Pro 2 and Powerbeats Fit are the two premier workout earbuds from Beats and represent some of the best options on the market for athletes. But which Powerbeats earbuds are best? Let's find out.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-design-and-fit-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Design and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-eartips.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More so than sound quality or specs, the design and comfort of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Powerbeats Fit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> will set them apart for buyers. While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a large ear hook that wraps around your ear lobe for maximum stability and security, the Powerbeats Fit have a stabilization trick of their own. The smaller Powerbeats Fit earbuds feature wing tips that create a secure fit against the concha of your outer ear. I still prefer the full ear hooks, but it's impossible to ignore how much lighter and more comfortable the Powerbeats Fit are due to the alternative design.</p><p>Compared to the Beats Fit Pro, the Powerbeats Fit have wing tips that are 20% more flexible. This means they should be more comfortable and easier to adjust to your individual ear shape. Beats also made a similar change with the Powerbeats Pro 2, making the entire ear hook more flexible. Our reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Tshaka Armstrong</a> found the Powerbeats Fit to be "incredibly comfortable, yet so locked in my ears," which is high praise for a set of workout earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wing tips on the Powerbeats Fit offer a tighter fit in your ear than the Powerbeats Pro 2. The latter's ear hooks prevent the earbuds from physically falling out of your ears, but the ear tips can still slide out on occasion, requiring adjustments.</p><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 have a larger footprint overall, including the large ear hooks. These earbuds also feature on-device controls, a volume rocker, and a playback button on both the left and right earbuds. While the Powerbeats Fit have a basic play/pause button on each earbud, they don't feature a volume rocker. I love using the volume controls on the Powerbeats Pro 2 to quickly raise or lower the volume of my music during a run without needing a smartwatch or phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-beats-vs-airpods-comparison.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats Fit Pro, Powerbeats Fit, AirPods </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To fit the larger earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is larger than the one for the Powerbeats Fit. It's pocketable, but barely. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Fit case is compact and much more manageable. However, you give up wireless charging compatibility as the Powerbeats Fit case only supports USB-C.</p><p>To help you find a good fit, both Powerbeats models support the Ear Tip Fit Test, found in the iOS Settings app or the Beats app for Android. The Powerbeats Pro 2 ships with five ear tips in the box, ranging from extra small to extra large. Powerbeats Fit offers four, excluding the extra-large size option.</p><p>There is IPX4 certification for each Powerbeats version, which covers basic sweat-proofing and protection against light rain, but not much else. There's no dustproofing here, and only very limited water-resistance.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-sound-and-specs-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Sound and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-earbud-macro-b-side.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>-caliber internal components, the Powerbeats Fit use older hardware. Powerbeats Pro 2 feature the latest Apple H2 processor, which handles both digital signal processing and active noise cancellation. Powerbeats Fit still run on the Apple H1, an older but still competent audio chip.</p><p>Each set of earbuds features six onboard microphones for crisp calls and to support ANC features. The gyroscope, accelerometer, and optical sensors are also consistent between models. These sensors enable in-ear detection and automatic play/pause when the earbuds are placed in or removed from your ear. Notably, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an optical heart rate sensor in addition to the basic optical sensor used for wear detection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="xasxPtSRL5DV8ji43JCJJV" name="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-hrm-and-optical-sensors.JPG" alt="Powerbeats Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xasxPtSRL5DV8ji43JCJJV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2's heart rate sensor is based on the sensors used in the Apple Watch, albeit a smaller version.

Powerbeats Fit tend to have a V-shaped reproduction curve, where low- and high-end sounds can drown out the kids. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flatter curve, with strong bass but more balanced overall.</p><p>I don't mind a pair of workout headphones with a bass-heavy sound signature — it can help in noisy environments, like a gym or track. Unfortunately, though, the lack of an EQ means you're locked into Beats' sound profile, and that could be a dealbreaker if you don't like it.</p><p>Both earbuds also support ANC and transparency mode. It's about on par with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 (meaning it's excellent), but it isn't as good as AirPods Pro 3. I tend to use transparency mode for workout headphones like the Powerbeats Pro 2 and Fit to stay aware of my surroundings while running on a path or road. The ANC support ensures that both models can double as everyday earbuds if you'd like.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-which-should-you-buy-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For workouts, the absolute best earbuds for me are the Powerbeats Pro 2. The flexible ear hook effectively makes them drop-proof, the on-earbud controls are easy to use while running, and the newer Apple H2 chip enables new connectivity features. If you value similar things, you'll love the Powerbeats Pro 2. Throw in the built-in heart rate monitor as an added bonus, and it's pretty easy to justify the Powerbeats Pro 2's $50 price premium over the Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>That's not necessarily a knock against the Powerbeats Fit, because those earbuds are better as a daily driver. Due to their smaller size, lightweight design, and improved comfort, Powerbeats Fit can handle life outside of the gym better than Powerbeats Pro 2. They share many similarities with the first-generation AirPods Pro, except for wireless charging. The wing tip design should help them stay securely in your ear during long workouts.</p><p>If the Powerbeats Fit were a bit cheaper, they'd be an easier budget alternative to the Powerbeats Pro 2. However, the price difference is only $50, with the Fit costing $200 and the Pro 2 going for $250.

A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG18TLS"><strong>9% Black Friday discount</strong></a> may not sound like a lot, but when Garmin watches are typically quite pricey, any discount can help.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Garmin Venu 4</a> normally retails for $549, which is a $100 premium over its predecessor. Fortunately, this 9% discount brings that down to $499, which feels a bit more reasonable for a generational upgrade like this. This goes for both the 41mm and 45mm sizes, which are available in various color combinations. The leather band option is a bit pricier, but it still gets a price cut from $599 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG1TXC6">as low as $537</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday week is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03aa70d3-209b-4770-96db-37a37ff383c6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check: $499 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Price check: $499 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$499.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRG18TLS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC" name="garmin-venu-4-black-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Venu 4 just got its first official sale, and while this $50 discount may not feel like much, it'll help ease the strain on your wallet for this great fitness watch.

It has tons of sports modes, meaning no matter what you're into, it's ready. Plus, despite a few blips here and there, the Elevate v5 sensor is quite accurate, which we've also noticed when testing other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/black-friday-garmin-deals-2025">Garmin watches</a> with the sensor.</p><p>If you lift weights like me, you'll enjoy the pretty accurate rep counter and automatic sets, which also time your rests in between. You can also input your weight into the watch after each set, meaning you can ditch the pen and paper.</p><p>If you're coming from an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>, you may appreciate the newer UI. It's cleaner, faster, and makes more sense, so that anyone could pick it up and go.</p><p>You'll also appreciate features like Training Readiness, Health Status, and the sleep coach. All of these features, combined with Body Battery, are here to ensure that you're ready for whatever the day has in store.</p><p>You can set up a fitness plan in the Garmin app and follow it on the watch for easy guidance through your workout. And if you don't have a plan set up, the morning report will still surface daily workout recommendations to keep you moving. Post-workout details are also great, and the watch will even provide a visual representation of the muscles you worked out.</p><p>Oh, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> may have less battery life than its predecessor, it makes up for it by including a new flashlight, which gets pretty bright and can come in handy during night runs!</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-42">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Vats quotes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ya_sking12767/status/1993685977072635927">another tipster</a>, who alleges that Samsung has "set their plan" to kickstart a One UI 8.5 beta program on December 8, though that date could change. Vats hops in, claiming that others have said similar things, and that this could be the case for "Phase 1."</p><p>Phase 1 is likely just what may be One UI 8.5 Beta 1, with the tipster claiming that Beta 2 could begin two weeks later, on December 22. Moreover, it seems that each "phase" or beta could bring in a different set of users.</p><p>The first is supposedly for the U.S., Korea, the U.K., and Germany, while the latter is aimed at bringing in India and Poland.</p><p>This beta is supposedly expected to roll into the new year, with a One UI 8.5 Beta 3 preparing for a potential January 5 due date. These betas are roughly two weeks after each other, as Samsung seemingly looks to get this software tested and ready for its eventual release. Previous rumors have expected this beta to hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a> first, but users on X are wondering about a chance for the Galaxy S24, though nothing's been stated yet.</p><h2 id="it-s-beginning-to-look-a-lot-like-beta-time-2">It's beginning to look a lot like beta time</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive 👀I’m hearing the same from my sources — One UI 8.5 Beta 2 is expected around 22nd Dec, and Beta 3 around 5th Jan.This means:• Phase 1 users could get it on 8th Dec• Phase 2 users may get the One UI 8.5 beta on 22nd DecPhase 1: US, UK, Korea, GermanyPhase 2:… https://t.co/cu88FoieSH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993697461412798801">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've been playing with One UI 8.5 rumors since September, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ui-8-5-beta-program-for-samsung-galaxy-late-this-fall-rumored">previous rumors claimed</a> we were headed toward a beta this fall. That alleged timeframe was supposedly for later in November, and while we're pretty much there now, the narrative has changed. Still, reports from October suggested that the first beta would roll out for U.S., Korean, and European users, similar to the current trend from X.</p><p>Several weeks after, shortly before Halloween, rumors said that Samsung was looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">to hold off on a November beta</a>, as it grappled with Galaxy S26 series changes.</p><p>The delay part here is reportedly due to Samsung dropping the Galaxy S26 Plus for a Galaxy S26 Edge. However, it seems that this may no longer happen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">as the S25 Edge suffered low sales</a>.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>If you own a Roku TV and rely on it to stream your Plex media library while away from home, you might have woken up to a nasty surprise. Plex is enforcing a new restriction that effectively blocks remote video playback on Roku TV models.</p><p>Beginning this week, Plex will require users to pay for a subscription, either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-your-last-chance-to-buy-a-lifetime-plex-pass-before-prices-double">Plex Pass</a> or a new, lower-cost Remote Watch Pass, to stream personal media remotely to Roku devices, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/changes-coming-to-remote-streaming-on-roku/933671" target="_blank">forum post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/plex-is-now-enforcing-remote-play-restrictions-on-tvs/" target="_blank">How-To Geek</a>). So, if you usually watch movies or shows from your home server while away, you’ll now need a paid pass.</p><p>Plex has a reason for this change. Earlier this year, the company updated how remote playback works for personal media libraries, so remote streaming is no longer free. Now, it is included as part of a subscription, either with Plex Pass or the new Remote Watch Pass.</p><p>Previously, Plex users could connect to their home media servers from anywhere and stream content for free, which was a major draw for fans of self-hosting.</p><h2 id="you-now-need-one-of-two-paid-passes-2">You now need one of two paid passes</h2><p>Here’s how the new setup works now. If you or the media server administrator holds a Plex Pass, remote streaming remains seamless. All existing features, such as remote access and streaming, plus extra perks like skip-intro and transcoding, carry on as before.</p><p>For those who don’t need the full range of Plex Pass features, the Remote Watch Pass provides a more accessible option for unlocking remote streaming of personal media. Previously, it was possible to share a media server with friends or family and allow free streaming on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-roku">Roku devices</a>; moving forward, a subscription will be required to continue remote access.</p><p>That shift doesn’t just hit Roku. Plex says this paywall will roll out to other TV platforms — like Fire TV, Apple TV, and Android TV — and potentially to third-party clients that use Plex’s API sometime in 2026.</p><p>If you’re interested in maintaining flexibility, you have two choices: purchase a pass (Plex Pass or Remote Watch Pass) or explore alternative options.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 7 (256GB version) before the Black Friday sale comes to an end and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip7/buy/galaxy-z-flip7-256gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f766udbaxaa/"><strong>you'll be eligible for up to $600 off with trade-in OR a straight $300 off</strong></a> if you skip the trade-in process altogether.</p><p>For a little context, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025">Amazon's Black Friday sale</a> is offering $200 off the top-rated flip phone, which means Samsung is selling the phone for a full $100 less. As if that wasn't enough, Samsung's Black Friday deal is sweetening the deal by giving you access to some additional bundle discounts (such as 52% off the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro), six months of Google AI Pro, a six-month subscription to SiriusXM streaming, and more. It's not often that Amazon's pricing gets clobbered by the competition, so this win from Samsung is quite the welcome sight.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="7dce392b-e704-418e-9068-fc1919582545" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip7/buy/galaxy-z-flip7-256gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f766udbaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RCghr9kgtFzStu7NfLReqY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-official-render-blue" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCghr9kgtFzStu7NfLReqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip7/buy/galaxy-z-flip7-256gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f766udbaxaa/" data-dimension112="7dce392b-e704-418e-9068-fc1919582545" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>From $499.99 with trade-in | $799.99 without at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>Head to Samsung during the site's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-deals-official-sale-2025">big Black Friday sale</a> and you'll be eligible for up to $600 off the Galaxy Z Flip 7 when you trade in an old or broken phone.

It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-large-gen-1-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-green-lenses-shiny-black/BCKVZQ48SG"><strong>G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off)</strong></a> and its more popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-large-gen-1-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-polarized-gradient-graphite-lenses-matte-black/BCKVZQ48S4"><strong>Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off)</strong></a>. Meta glasses have <em>never</em> gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity.</p><p>In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta <strong>just</strong> launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses</a>, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison.</p><p>Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes <em>much</em> more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0fd42638-d25e-423f-859f-df92488d1f05" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension48="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension25="$239.20" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-green-lenses-shiny-black/BCKVZQ48PC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1562px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FWzQpn9qgLFJPxHMVokrFB" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FWzQpn9qgLFJPxHMVokrFB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1562" height="1562" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ray-ban-meta-wayfarer-glasses-with-meta-ai-audio-photo-video-compatibility-polarized-gradient-graphite-lenses-matte-black/BCKVZQZ5S6" data-dimension112="0fd42638-d25e-423f-859f-df92488d1f05" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension48="or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329" data-dimension25="$239.20"><del>$329</del> <strong>$263.20 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★</a></p><p>The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights.

The photo resolution and FoV, storage space, IPX4 water resistance, mic and speaker quality, Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth connectivity, and apps are unchanged, while the weight is virtually the same.</p><p>The new glasses do give you a video resolution boost from 1080p to 3K and a couple of extra hours of battery life. But is it worth spending an extra $150 or so for the 2nd-gen polarized glasses, just to get these two perks?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P8jsRxUgQ5dsoGG2gVPEFf" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Forerunner-970" alt="A photo of Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and a Garmin Forerunner 970 smartwatch in front of them on a wooden picnic table, showing post-workout stats." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8jsRxUgQ5dsoGG2gVPEFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Equally important, Meta has already brought its best second-generation features to its first-gen glasses, making them feel new. Vanguard glasses introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">Garmin integration</a> in October, autocapturing videos at important race moments and reading out your health stats from your wrist; Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/garmin-integration-is-rolling-out-for-oakley-meta-hstn-and-ray-ban-meta">brought this feature to Gen 1 glasses</a> the next month.</p><p>Likewise, Vanguard glasses added improved video stabilization algorithms to make in-motion sporty videos look smoother, and Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-smart-glasses-video-stability-november-2025-update">brought the feature to first-gen glasses in November</a> without telling anyone. Meta isn't interested in gatekeeping its features to make you upgrade, which means you can buy the last-gen Ray-Ban deal without any FOMO.</p><p>The shorter battery life, you'll have to live with. But smart glasses fans lived with the 4-hour maximum for two years; you can too to get this Black Friday price! Or, if you can't, splurge on the full-price newer glasses without regrets!</p><h2 id="black-friday-quick-links-2">Black Friday quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Boox brand became particularly strong after the release of the phone-sized Boox Palma went viral, but Bigme is an up-and-coming brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/only-one-of-these-three-color-e-readers-is-right-for-you">with a ton of great options</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, most of Bigme's lineup is on sale for Black Friday this year, and I can wholeheartedly recommend all of them.

Once all those copies have been borrowed, you'll have to register for a waitlist until someone returns a copy.</p><p>Everyone's home screen will look a little different depending on how your local library organizes things.

According to a recent report by the Financial Times (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/25/spotify-planning-us-price-hike-in-early-2026-report-claims/">9to5 Google</a>), there has been some chatter that the streaming platform may increase prices for U.S. customers early next year.</p><p>Spotify increased its prices for subscribers in the U.S. back in 2024, when the cost of the every tier went up significantly, the Family plan experienced the largest jump, rising by $3 to reach $19.99 per month, while the Duo plan increased by $2 to and Individual plan went up to $11.99. Amidst these widespread increases, the Student plan was the only option to remain unchanged, holding steady at $5.99.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify Premium Platinum plan details in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfNXmNKkCC8CdfEWrjzDfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But if these rumors are indeed true, then it would mean U.S. users are facing their third price increase in less than three years (July 2023, July 2024, and potentially Q1 2026).</p><p>And while we don't know for sure how much each specific plan will see an increase, if Spotify follows its similar pattern from the previous years, then the multi-user plans may see a higher price point when compared to individual plans.

These labels feel that music subscriptions are capped at a lower cost compared to video services like Netflix or Disney Plus, which have raised prices multiple times recently.</p><p>This potential price increase could also be linked to the renewal of Spotify's licensing deals with these labels. New agreements are expected to include clauses that would result in higher royalty payments, costs that Spotify may pass on to its subscribers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U" name="Spotify-Smart-Shuffle" alt="Spotify Shuffle options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, this could benefit Spotify's financial standing as well.

Usually, people expect me to recommend smartwatches, rings, earbuds, and XR deals that I'd buy for myself.

Naturally, the last thing on my mind is buying <em>even</em> <em>more</em> devices! Some companies have me mail tech back; others don't. It'd be unethical to sell tech I was given for review, so I'm left with piles of devices that I break out whenever I need to test new features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sdXjsFHoDpzMu7Vfoe32AS" name="My-massive-smartwatch-collection" alt="A photo of two plastic containers, one large and one small, sitting on a wooden bookshelf, both full of smartwatches, with three smartwatches (the Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Forerunner 970, and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic) sitting in front of both containers on the shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdXjsFHoDpzMu7Vfoe32AS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's assume a robber snuck in and carried out ten years' worth of hoarded tech devices.

Because of that, I swapped my Pixel Watch 3 with an Amazfit T-Rex 3 earlier this year and haven't looked back since. Now you can get the same great experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/"><strong>for $53 less</strong></a> with this excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deal. But if you want the best deal possible this week, Amazon's excellent Renewed program will get you a refurbished T-Rex 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Refurbished-Military-Water-Resistant-Smartwatch/dp/B0DJ7S43SK/"><strong>for just $159</strong></a> out the door. The catch is that the latter deal only applies to Prime members.</p><p>The Amazfit T-Rex 3 is an incredibly impressive smartwatch with a gorgeous AMOLED screen, one month battery life (seriously!), and support for tracking 170 different sports and types of workouts. It's also got offline dual-band GPS for epic accuracy, a free diving mode, and more.</p><p>Last weekend, I took it on a third Spartan race for this year, and it performed as exemplary as I expected. That dual-band GPS is perfect for tracking your runs accurately, even in dense cities, and I'd be willing to bet it's more accurate than any older smartwatch you're wearing right now. And even with all this regular tracking, I still only charge it about once a month.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9030aa34-7262-44aa-97bd-8affdd5fe4e6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension48="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.55%;"><img id="CateFeyUxRYuoGPqCc4cNG" name="Amazfit T-Rex 3 product image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CateFeyUxRYuoGPqCc4cNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1316" height="1389" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Outdoor-Navigation-Satellite-Freediving/dp/B0DCZ9PRCP/" data-dimension112="9030aa34-7262-44aa-97bd-8affdd5fe4e6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension48="⌚ Amazfit T-Rex 3: $279.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$279.99 </del><strong>$226 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>👉 <strong>Buy Renewed and save even more!: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Refurbished-Military-Water-Resistant-Smartwatch/dp/B0DJ7S43SK/"><strong>$159.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">Amazfit</a> has made a name for itself over the years by providing substantial value with its fitness-focused smartwatches, and the T-Rex 3 is a stellar flagship watch from the company.

It automatically counts my reps while running strength training or other lifting exercises built into the watch, and it's super simple to switch sets and weight with quick 5lb increments.</p><p>Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, Amazfit's Zepp app tracks the muscles you use for each type of workout and often does a great job of automatically identifying certain types of workouts. If I'm doing barbell backsquats, for instance, I just start the "strength training" exercise on the watch, and it typically understands that I'm doing barbell backsquats based on my movements. It's really cool, and you can always easily change the workout from the app at any time after the fact.</p><p>The Amazfit T-Rex 3 goes beyond just workout tracking and everyday notification management, too. The Zepp app, used to connect the watch to your phone, has a great UI that's insightful and user-friendly. Part of that is made possible by Amazfit's clever use of AI to surface information you're looking for, and the other half is just good design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW" name="amazfit-zepp-app-ai-powered-food-logging" alt="Logging food in the Zepp app easily with AI voice prompts and photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite parts of the app is the AI-powered meal tracking capabilities, which let you type or voice a natural language prompt to input meals. That means no more scanning barcodes or scrolling through lists of junk.</p><p>Just tell it, "I had 2 scrambled eggs, a piece of buttered toast, and a glass of orange juice for breakfast," and it uses AI to understand and input that into your daily log quickly. It's easily the single most useful AI tool I use daily, and it means I actually track my diet instead of getting lazy and quitting half a day into the week.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-47">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thanks to various leaks and rumors, we have a rough idea of what to expect. What has me most excited, though, is not the new processor or the cameras, but the new design. If all goes well, we should finally get a Galaxy Ultra phone that has proper ergonomics for daily use. Samsung has a strong contender from China in the form of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max.</p><p>This is technically the first phone to ship with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, but it is not available globally yet. The most interesting thing about it is the giant display on the back of the phone, which opens up new and interesting ways of interacting with your apps and content. We expect the 17 Pro Max to be available in more countries, apart from China, by the time the Galaxy S26 Ultra launches, and this makes it yet another strong competitor.</p><p>If you're wondering which is the better phone between the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max, we've got you covered.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-xiaomi-17-pro-max-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">new design</a> looks very interesting. It's not so much the camera placement that's changing but the ergonomics of the phone. The curvier corners should make it a lot more pocketable and easier to use with one hand. A more recent leak hints that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-leak-reveals-slimmer-lighter-flagships-that-one-up-apples-new-iphones">new weight</a> of the Ultra is expected to be 214 grams. This is four grams lower than the S25 Ultra and five grams less than the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. The thickness is also expected to be 7.9mm, which is just a smidge below the 8mm of the Pro Max.</p><p>We don't know if Samsung will increase the size of the display, but it should be at least 6.9 inches like the current model. You can also expect a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>, which could be the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank"> “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a> we've heard of before.

The main screen measures 6.9 inches with a 2,608x1,200 resolution and a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display. Peak brightness is an impressive 3,500 nits, and the screen is protected by Xiaomi's Dragon Crystal Glass 3. What's more impressive is the rear 2.9-inch LTPO AMOLED that carries the same peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate. It also supports Dolby Vision playback, which is unique.</p><p>The 17 Pro Max is a large phone too, weighing 219 grams, and is nearly as slim as the Galaxy. Xiaomi has given it an IP68 rating, which is something we're also expecting for the S26 Ultra (if not better). Apart from having a display on the back of the phone, the design is pretty standard with a metal and glass construction, and flat sides with curved edges.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-xiaomi-17-pro-max-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S26 Ultra is only expected to arrive in early 2026, and prices should start at $1,299.99 or be $100 more if the price hike rumor turns out to be true. In any case, this is going to be a much more expensive smartphone than the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. Keep in mind that this is just the base pricing, which means if you want to get 512GB or 1TB of storage, be prepared to pay up to $1,800.</p><p>We don't know this for sure yet, but the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra should use a custom version of Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC</a>, just like previous generations. Benchmarks should be slightly better than what the 17 Pro Max can put out, but we'll have to wait and see. The phone should also come with at least 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. We should also hopefully get the latest UFS 4.1 storage type for quicker read and write speeds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KtmcyZz4AEJ4pVpc3iNamg" name="xiaomi-17-pro-max-render-gaming-case-androidcentral" alt="Xiaomi 17 Pro Max render gaming case for rear display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtmcyZz4AEJ4pVpc3iNamg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro Max hasn't launched globally yet, but converting the China price of 5,999 Yuan gives us roughly $840. Even with taxes, it should be under $1,000 when it does eventually launch. It comes in Black, White, Purple, and Green. The Pro Max is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip and comes with 12GB or 16GB of RAM. Storage starts at 256GB and goes up to 1TB.</p><p>Battery capacity of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max is one area where the Galaxy S26 Ultra can't possibly compete.

The Pro Max gets really quick charging of 100W wired and 50W wireless. It can even do 22.5W reverse wireless charging, which is simply bonkers. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to have the same 5,000mAh battery capacity, but we could see a bump in charging speed up to 60W.</p><p>There's no mention of Qi2 charging on the 17 Pro Max, but the Galaxy S26 Ultra should definitely support it.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Xiaomi 17 Pro Max</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, Privacy Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, 3,500 nits peak brightness (main display); 2.9-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz refresh rate, up to 3,500 nits peak (rear display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/ 16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP, f/1.7, 24mm (wide)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.7, 23mm (wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>10MP, f/2.4, 67mm (telephoto)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/2.4 (ultrawide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/3.4 (periscope telephoto)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/2.6 (periscope telephoto)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.9 (ultrawide)</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/2.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 or IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>7,500mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>60W, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w/ 25W wireless speeds</p></td><td  ><p>100W wired, 50W wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77.9 x 7.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.9 x 77.6 x 8 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>214 grams</p></td><td  ><p>219 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 w/ Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>HyperOS 3, Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro Max runs HyperOS 3 based on Android 16.

It has one telephoto camera less than the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but its 50MP sensor can do 5x optical zoom.

Xiaomi's current best camera phone is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and I believe there should be a Xiaomi 17 Ultra that will soon take its place sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-xiaomi-17-pro-max-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're sold on the novelty of having a second display on the back of your smartphone, the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max might be worth a look. Global availability is currently bleak, but that should change soon. It should be cheaper than the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but be sure to double-check 5G compatibility with your carrier, especially if you're in the U.S..</p><p>For most buyers, though, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra makes more sense. It will be much easier to buy globally, which means you'll have better after sales support, something that's crucial and is often overlooked. While it won't have the head-turning feature of the Xiaomi, it will get more years of software updates, and it has the S Pen. Samsung's GalaxyAI features have also gotten pretty good, and we should have some new on-device tools to play with in the new Ultra, making it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2026.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4fcfb2f7-172a-43a9-9444-78f045b34935">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwtaJvqMJgDvj7Axd9tSn9.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leaked render - square"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future is coming soon</strong></em></p><p>While we wait for Samsung to unveil what the Galaxy S26 Ultra will bring, the rumors and leaks paint an interesting picture.

You can alter an image, reimagine it, or even create something entirely new without leaving the Messages app. It'll work regardless of what phones your friends have — as long as they're using the Google Messages app, they can see your remixes and reply with their own.</p><p>Here's the step-by-step process for using Remix in Google Messages:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages app</strong>, and <strong>select a photo</strong>. (This can be a photo that's already been sent or a new one from your gallery.)</p><p>2.

It tosses aside OnePlus' unique design language for conformity, and ditches features like a QHD+ display and Hasselblad image processing. It's especially disappointing when you compare the OnePlus 15 to the OPPO Find X9 Pro, a similar but very different handset. Now that OnePlus and OPPO have been under the same company for a while, the lines between their phone models are blurrier than ever.</p><p>The choice between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> and the OPPO Find X9 Pro will almost certainly come down to regional availability. While the Find X9 Pro is sold in the U.K., it's not available in North America. The OnePlus 15 is sold in Canada and will be available in the U.S. once the brand gets its FCC certifications sorted out. But, there's always the option of importing the OnePlus 15 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">OPPO Find X9 Pro</a> into your country.</p><p>So, which is the best option? Let's compare the OnePlus 15 and the OPPO Find X9 Pro to find out.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oppo-find-x9-pro-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OPPO Find X9 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 camera review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knTtyyXRVbhUCB9gBC86mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5126" height="2887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus and OPPO each made the decision to lean into conventional smartphone design trends, which recently favored boxy, flat, and rectangular chassis. As such, the OnePlus 15 and OPPO Find X9 Pro each lose their curves and circular rear camera arrangement in favor of a new, standard slab design. The phones look more boring as a result, and clever leather finish options are gone. They look like an iPhone, which is the look many phone brands are going for in 2025.</p><p>The look and feel of the OnePlus 15 and OPPO Find X9 Pro will be consistent across both devices, but there are differences. Each phone has a square-ish camera bump on the top-left corner of the device's back. However, the Find X9 Pro's flash lives outside the bump, and there's a Hasselblad logo where you'd find the flash on the OnePlus 15. The OPPO logo on the Find X9 Pro is near the bottom of the device and is more subtle, whereas the OnePlus logo on the 15 is centered, with black font that stands out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G9HWge6z7CKFf8JYzfVCd9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G9HWge6z7CKFf8JYzfVCd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of talk about the OnePlus 15's display and its apparent downgrades, but the changes won't matter much in this comparison. It's true that OnePlus swapped its QHD+ display with a 3K resolution on the OnePlus 13 for a new, 1.5K panel on the OnePlus 15. However, the OPPO Find X line never had a 3K panel, so there's no love lost here. The OPPO Find X9 Pro sports the same display as the prior generation, and it has the same 1.5K resolution as the OnePlus 15.</p><p>OnePlus technically has the edge here, as its 1.5K AMOLED display can reach 165Hz on the OnePlus 15. This is designed for gaming, where the extra frame rates matter — the phone will default to 120Hz in most situations. Meanwhile, the OPPO Find X9 Pro's display panel tops out at 120Hz in all situations. Both use LTPO technologies to add smoothness and responsiveness for scrolling and animations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hFpkA4kc5uUVtxoPo2ZwDN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFpkA4kc5uUVtxoPo2ZwDN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4966" height="2797" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each phone has a 6.78-inch screen, but the Find X9 Pro's display bezels are over a millimeter smaller than its predecessor.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 and the OPPO Find X9 Pro each have an aluminum chassis with IP69 certifications against dust and water ingress.

However, it also runs hot, and this has already started to become an issue for early OnePlus 15 testers. It's paired with either 12GB or 16GB of memory, depending on your storage configuration.</p><p>OPPO uses the MediaTek Dimensity 9500 processor to drive the Find X9 Pro, and this is also a current-generation 3nm chip. You get 16GB of RAM as standard with the Find X9 Pro, which will be helpful for AI tasks and gaming. In our testing of the MediaTek-powered Find X9 Pro, we learned that this phone and chip combo can hang with the best of the best in performance, while running cooler than its competitors.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Oppo Find X9 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch 1.5K AMOLED, 165Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz, 2772x1272, Dolby Vision, 3600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9500</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 512GB UFS 4.1</p></td><td  ><p>512GB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Wide, f/1.8, 24mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch f/1.5 Sony Lytia LYT-828, 23mm, 4K120 Dolby Vision video, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Periscope telephoto, f/2.8, 80mm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.56-inch f/2.1 Samsung HP5 telephoto, 70mm, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Ultrawide, f/2.0,  16mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.75-inch f/2.0 Samsung JN5, 15mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP wide, f/2.4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP69</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>7,500mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>80-100W/120W wired, 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, 5W reverse wired</p></td><td  ><p>80W wired charging, 50W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.2 x 76.4 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211g or 215g</p></td><td  ><p>224g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 16 w/ Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>ColorOS 16 based on Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both handsets support the latest connectivity standards, including 5G, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 6.0.

It also marks the end of OnePlus' partnership with Hasselblad, and the introduction of the company's in-house DetailMax Engine for image processing. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera review,</a> we found that the OnePlus 15's main camera performs well in most situations, despite using a smaller 1/1.56-inch sensor size. However, the experience overall is inconsistent, but still better than what we get from Google and Samsung here in North America.</p><p>With that being said, the OPPO Find X9 Pro keeps the Hasselblad partnership and still sports industry-leading camera hardware. It has a new 50MP f/1.5 Sony LYT-828 sensor made in collaboration with Sony, plus a 200MP telephoto camera offering 3x optical zoom. It can also shoot 4K120 video, a major improvement compared to its predecessor. Overall, you can expect the Find X9 Pro to outperform the OnePlus 15 in camera quality, especially if you prefer Hasselblad's take on post-processing.</p><p>The front-facing camera battle goes to the Find X9 Pro, too — it has a 50MP sensor compared to the OnePlus 15's 32MP sensor.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oppo-find-x9-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OPPO Find X9 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-03" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the OPPO Find X9 Pro makes some of the same mistakes as the OnePlus 15, it doesn't make as many of them. Sure, the Find X9 Pro similarly loses its unique design language for another flat rectangle. It also retains its standout camera system and a Hasselblad partnership for sharper image processing. Usually, I'd give the OnePlus 15 credit for its use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, but the phone's overheating concerns might cancel out the positive benefits.</p><p>Meanwhile, the OnePlus 15's gaming-focused features are a bright spot, especially the raw performance, long battery life during intensive tasks, and 165Hz display. Those changes won't resonate with everyone, though. For the average consumer, the OnePlus 15 may be worse than the OnePlus 13 on paper. If you have the choice between the OPPO Find X9 Pro and the OnePlus 15, I'd argue the scales tip in favor of OPPO.</p><p>Still, availability will be the biggest factor. You <em>can</em> import the OPPO Find X9 Pro into the U.S., but there are risks, especially with carrier compatibility and supported cellular bands. That means if you want an OPPO/OnePlus phone in North America, the OnePlus 15 is your only real option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e169d00b-15ca-4f5c-a76b-cb94f4156d64">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For North American buyers</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 is the only option for buyers in the U.S. and Canada.

The tipster discovered that Google is looking to place this "Projects" feature in the side panel of the Gemini app. From there, users can tap "New Project" and begin working, but Google's development gives a small description of the feature.</p><p>According to the post, Google's code states users can "Add up to 10 files that Gemini can reference throughout your project."</p><p>The publication likens this supposed Gemini feature to OpenAI's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt">Projects in ChatGPT</a>." The company's support page for this feature states this feature is all about context, as users can upload files, instructions, and more for the AI in that project session to help keep it "on topic." Speculation claims that Google is moving in this direction, too, which is furthered by the development's little tid-bit: "projects keep your work and ideas organized. You can add context and tell Gemini how to help."</p><p>Google is seemingly continuing down this path of a more personalized or "focused" AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">kind of like NotebookLM</a> (in a way).</p><p>At the moment, the tipster was unable to surface more of Gemini's Projects, specifically, how this would work. Right now, they were able to get as far as the "Give your project a name" screen, right before "create project" becomes accessible. It's probably safe to say Google will have a more expansive screen after this, one that gives users a chance to upload their files and enter in their instructions, per the leaked descriptors.</p><h2 id="a-more-personal-focused-ai-2">A more personal, focused AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="UAWzjy3DmTFUcayUHbWQfL" name="google-gemini-projects-feature-leak" alt="The Gemini app displays a "Projects" section in its side menu, which, per the leaks, could help users focus the AI on specific topics." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAWzjy3DmTFUcayUHbWQfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, it seems that Google is working on bringing NotebookLM to Gemini in a future update; at least, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-and-notebooklm-could-work-even-closer-together-in-a-future-update">that's what the rumors suggest</a>. It seems that the company will expand its "Attachments" menu in the Gemini app to include the option to import your NotebookLM notebooks. This importing feature would also include sources, if this actually progresses to a stable launch.</p><p>Google is really trying to blur the lines between Gemini and its focused NotebookLM model to help users research, understand, and sift through heavy information and research. Each side has its strengths, which is also something Google may want to capitalize on by merging them and showing users their varying uses all in one place.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">updates for Gemini</a> include a more personalized experience, which is tailored to the user and their interests/needs, based on their Search behavior.

Google says it's rolling out a new feature for Android that brings "one-tap transfer" suggestion chips to users.</p><p>Google says users will find these suggestions within their media output switcher.

Google said it planned to make "switching content between devices seamless with apps like YouTube Music and Spotify." Additionally, this feature was supposed to be present within your notifications.

The redesign (and complete rebrand) updated things to Find Hub from Find My Device. This update also brought the "People" tab out of beta, meaning users can find people they'd like to share their location with through that interface. Google also teased two new features headed for Find Hub later this year: precision finding with UWB and satellite connectivity.</p><p>An update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-users-can-now-pick-their-preferred-google-find-hub-measurement-units">just a couple of weeks ago</a> brought the ability for users to choose their desired unit of measurement, as well as an updated list of supported trackers.</p> ]]></dc:content>
