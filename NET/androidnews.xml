Joined by a few content creators, Mohan discussed YouTube's plans to incorporate Google's latest video generation model, Veo 3, into Shorts. To Mohan, bringing Veo 3 into the fold will "open new creative lanes" for new and existing content creators.</p><p>According to Mohan, YouTube plans to properly incorporate Google's Veo 3 model into its Short environment "later this summer."</p><p>It seems YouTube is placing a lot of focus on its creators, considering the use cases for Veo 3. Not only did Mohan claim "the possibilities with AI are limitless," but he states, "creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream."</p><p>YouTube feels that AI tools for video can help usher its creators' creativity into a new era. More than that, the platform is trying to solidify itself as the premier destination, per se, that it hopes will draw even more people in to create more content.</p><h2 id="youtube-sees-a-future-with-veo-3-2">YouTube sees a future with Veo 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1649px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="8LM4MZ3z5sFoRQXuvEnHrn" name="youtube-made-on-event-ai-veo-hero.jpeg" alt="YouTube Shorts will soon receive DeepMind AI, Veo, brains." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8LM4MZ3z5sFoRQXuvEnHrn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1649" height="928" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Originally, in September 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">the Made by YouTube event</a> highlighted the platform's plans to incorporate Google's Veo into Shorts. The model would leverage its capabilities to understand "natural language" for video generation purposes.

Veo 3's audio capabilities were highlighted during the announcement; however, Google made it clear those could be unlocked using its Google AI Ultra subscription. Nevertheless, it teased Veo 3's ability to bring your idea to life, complete with the sound of rain, footsteps, and more to complete the package.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature seems to have been spotted in the Google app bearing version <strong>16.23.69</strong>.

Here, a selected video can be of five minutes, or users can upload multiple videos, but the run time should be five minutes (combined).<br><br>To try the feature, users need to hit the "plus" button in the Gemini text box and upload a video from their gallery/ files, provided the feature is available for the handset first.

The company highlighted the device in a press release, adding that the band can run for seven nights on a single full charge. Garmin's vice president of consumer sales and marketing, Susan Lyman, said, "Wearing this smart sleep band every night can provide in-depth sleep insights and a more complete picture of fitness and recovery."</p><p>Users will find similar functions with the smart band as they would with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. The post highlights the band's ability to capture your sleep data, such as sleep stages (light, deep, REM) and HRV status. The next morning, Garmin says your Index Sleep Monitor will upload its sleep data to provide you with a Sleep Score, ranging between zero and 100.</p><p>Sleep functions continue with Pulse Ox. Garmin says the sleep band can even track and calculate your blood oxygen saturation throughout the night.</p><p>Moreover, the company worked in Breathing variations and Respiration data. The former partners with Pulse Ox, so users can "better understand shifts in breathing patterns." The latter gives you information on any changes in your breathing rates while you were sleeping.</p><h2 id="garmin-s-health-focus-evolves-2">Garmin's Health-focus Evolves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:910px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.93%;"><img id="ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S" name="garmin-index-sleep-monitor-band-example" alt="A model is wearing the Garmin Index Sleep Monitor on her right arm while she sleeps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="910" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another major part of this Garmin smart sleep band is its tracking capabilities for women's health. Garmin states the Index Sleep Monitor will leverage a woman's skin temperature to provide insightful menstrual cycle estimations and information. Additionally, the device can help women keep track of their pregnancy, as well as provide exercise and nutrition assistance.</p><p>Aside from menstrual tracking, the sleep band's skin temperature readings can assist users with early signs of "potential illness" and other changes to their sleep environment that might've affected them.</p><p>Stress tracking throughout the night is available, and "Body Battery energy monitoring." With this, Garmin says the band will inform the wearer if they should take the day easier, meaning get some more rest. Garmin recommends wearing one of its compatible smartwatches, which will further the Body Battery feature to give you a "complete" picture of whether you should push yourself or take it easy.</p><p>The Garmin Index Sleep Monitor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1650098/">is available now</a> for $169.99 in Small and Medium, as well as Large and Extra Large sizes.

But even though Google didn't "announce" anything at AWE, I learned a lot about its strategy to rely on partners like Samsung, Qualcomm, and Unity to court skeptical developers.</p><p>Here's every tidbit I gleaned from my AWE 2025 event about Android XR!</p><h2 id="an-android-xr-recruiting-blitz-for-devs-2">An Android XR recruiting blitz for devs</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lowVrEFOsV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"Google has been working in the glasses space for 10 years, and we have not stopped." Google has been using that line since it announced Android XR last year, and Payne brought it out again at AWE. Google <em>really</em> wants to reassure us that the deaths of Google Glass and Daydream were exaggerated and that Android XR won't end up in the Graveyard.</p><p>Payne, who leads Google's XR product management team, said that despite "massive strides forward in both hardware and software," the true "inflection point" for XR has been the rise of multimodal AI and LLMs. They're pushing Gemini as the glue across all VR/AR headsets and smart glasses, and reassuring developers that they can access Gemini to simplify their own XR apps.</p><p>"AI will do for XR products what the touchscreen did for smartphones," Payne argued. And since devs can access the Gemini API through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?api=dev">Firebase AI Logic SDK</a>, they may be tempted to join Android XR and experiment with multimodal AI for their apps.</p><p>You can currently only code Android XR apps for VR headsets like Moohan, but Google will open up software for smart glasses "later this year," and it's also working with Samsung and glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">designers like Warby Parker</a> to "ship the first set of smart glasses soon."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3RKYVmC39UzAdraZPJ8DFZ" name="Android-XR-AWE-2025-perception-stack" alt="Google's Hugo Swart on stage at AWE 2025 discussing Android XR's "Powerful Perception Stack."

Devs can create one app with one SDK that'll port to headsets and glasses, saving them development time.</p><p>Plus, Google is "deeply integrating and optimizing our code to Snapdragon," so that Android XR works natively on chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomms-new-on-device-ai-chip-could-change-smart-glasses-forever">Snapdragon AR1+</a> that support on-device AI for smart glasses.

But after Android XR was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ignored-android-xr-at-gdc-2025-and-indie-vr-devs-are-concerned">no-show at GDC 2025</a>, I wondered what Google's plan was to support gaming devs on its new platform.</p><p>It turns out many of the biggest VR game devs like Owlchemy Labs and Resolution games have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://unity.com/blog/porting-apps-games-over-android-xr-unity-6">ported to Android XR using Unity 6</a>, which supports OpenXR input handling and a Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for graphical compatibility.</p><p>I attended an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1300">AWE panel</a> by Mirrorscape, an Android XR Early Access Program developer bringing its "Fallout Factions XR" game to Android XR later in 2025, to get insights into what it's like porting games to the platform.</p><p>The CEO, Grant Anderson, described the "godsend" of designing for a virtual space instead of a "little rectangle," aka your phone. Mirrorscape coded using Unity, which has an "AR foundation" for features like plane tracking and hand gesture recognition, while targeting the OpenXR standard behind most VR games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kAYFQpoEPEnmKHnYPeVLXJ" name="AWE-2025-Android-XR-panel-slide" alt="A screen at AWE 2025 showing "Unity & Android XR: Technical Foundation."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kAYFQpoEPEnmKHnYPeVLXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR games have elements of OpenXR, Unity, and Vulcan built into them. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Unity does its best to make the conversion to Android XR painless, he warned that "adapting to architectural changes and new rendering pipeline requirements in Unity 6 can be a heavy lift and take some time."</p><p>He also noted that "there's not a lot of Android XR headsets out there" right now, nor an emulator for virtual testing. Until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Samsung Moohan headset</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google reference AR glasses</a> become widely available, devs must build their own reference hardware to check their XR apps, which sounds challenging.</p><p>Plus, devs have to optimize for Snapdragon XR2 hardware, relying on tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/introducing-application-spacewarp/">Spacewarp</a> and foveated rendering. But Quest VR devs should find this familiar.</p><p>The last pain point he mentioned was that the Android XR SDK gets frequent updates in alpha, which can cause "package conflicts" between it and Unity without constant firmware updates. Presumably, this will become less of an issue once Android XR reaches stability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KyHktkhsr8cwRmACgLvfFJ" name="AWE-2025-android-xr-unity-toolkit" alt="A screen at AWE 2025 showing the text "Your toolkit for building on Android XR" with Showcase Samples, Unity Verified Package Support, and a URL for Android XR developer tools." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KyHktkhsr8cwRmACgLvfFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unity and Google co-hosted a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1365">AWE panel</a> on "Getting Started with Android XR Development in Unity." And according to Google project manager Ryan Bartley, you can work in-headset to update your XR game, "iterating on your work in seconds with changes from the Unity Editor appearing instantly on your headset." That sounds pretty handy!</p><p>Features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-headsets-will-take-vital-camera-option-from-android-phones">passthrough API</a>, plane detection, and hand tracking are all demonstrated through Unity packages, or "showcase samples," so that devs can apply the source code to their own games. And anyone who used the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for past XR experiences can migrate to Android XR using the compatibility plugin.</p><p>That is to say, many current VR experiences should be <em>capable</em> of a quick Android XR transition, though Unreal Engine games won't have as easy a conversion process.</p><p>I also learned that Google has held "four Android XR developer boot camps across the globe." Some Quest devs have complained about Google excluding them, so I'm curious if Google (or Samsung) will expand these boot camps or leave smaller devs to rely on Unity.</p><h2 id="counting-on-devs-to-join-android-xr-now-and-profit-later-2">Counting on devs to join Android XR now and profit later</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-7" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I attended several panels about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-google-described-conflicting-visions-of-ar-glasses-future-at-awe-2025">future of AR glasses at AWE</a> with Google and Meta execs, and Google's team is counting on devs being tempted by their open system and easy transition.</p><p>XREAL's Ralph Jodice said that anyone coding for Android XR now can be on their Project Aura headset right now, "and you should be." The idea is that devs' familiarity with Android will make the transition to Android XR easy, and once you optimize your app, it'll work across the entire "ecosystem" of devices as they arrive.</p><p>That said, Google needs to assure devs that they'll get a return on investment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-will-never-recover-from-its-stadia-debacle">Killing Stadia</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-daydream-vr-platform-finally-and-fully-dead">Daydream</a>, Cardboard, and other services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/android-xr-will-be-another-doa-google-product">has given Google a reputation</a>, which is why Swart promised during his panel that Google is "committed to investing in the ecosystem." And Samsung's involvement makes it harder for Google to pull the plug unless its Korean partner decides to give up.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other issue is that we only know of Project Moohan, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">XREAL Project Aura</a>, and a handful of other niche Android XR devices from Sony and others; none of them will be as affordable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>. As open as Android XR is, devs need assurances that enough people will buy their apps to make the transition worth it.</p><p>Meta's Kelly Ingham made that point during her smart glasses panel: their smart glasses system isn't open to people yet, but their "focus" is to "get as many devices in the market as we can" so devs can "develop an app and actually make money." It felt like a subtle jab at Android XR.</p><p>Swart promised that future Qualcomm reference devices for Android XR will be tailored "to a variety of use cases and price points" so ODMs can "balance visual quality and price." So perhaps we'll see an influx of affordable Android XR devices that go beyond elite productivity headsets.</p><p>Until then, it's hard to say whether VR and XR devs will buy into Android XR's open-platform promise or wait for more concrete hardware from Google's partners.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Even the bottom features three cutouts, one for its USB-C slot and two for its (alleged) shifted speakers.</p><p>While some cases can feel a little clunky, Thinborne states these Super Thin cases feature their "thinnest," minimalistic design. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/">Thinborne</a> also touts the grip on these thin cases that will hopefully keep you away from heartbreaking drops.</p><p>The inclusion of MagSafe technology on the case itself means users can enjoy wireless charging capabilities, if we're to expect this same range of devices for the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-series-sticks-with-four-2">The Pixel 10 series sticks with four?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-01" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-04" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-05" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-03" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Nothing is confirmed yet (of course), but it seems Thinborne is playing off a number of Pixel 10 rumors that suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">we'd see the same four phones</a> in 2025. Last September, an early Pixel 10 rumor claimed Google had already started development for the new series with the following codenames: Frankel, Blazer, Mustang, and Rango. These names concerned the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold, respectively.</p><p>At the time, designs hadn't been speculated yet; however, rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">this past winter</a> might've given us something to think about. A host of rumors from a social media tipster gave us a rumored glimpse at the Pixel 10 series, which could look exactly like the 9 series. It seems Google could stick with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">same large camera bar</a>, rounded corners, flat display, and the like.</p><p>Even the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked renders</a> suggest a phone that won't diverge much from last year's.</p><p>These are design elements Thinborne has seemingly adhered to in its early Pixel 10 case collection.</p><p>Additionally, rumors claim the base Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">could feature a triple camera setup</a>, like its higher-tier friends.

At a rumored 3.9mm thin when unfolded, it makes the 5.6mm Z Fold 6 look like a chonker. However, it also raises a few simple questions, such as: how would Samsung achieve this without making big sacrifices, particularly in the camera performance?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use.

Galaxy Z Fold phones have never had <em>bad</em> cameras, but there's never been a Z Fold that could outperform the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. This has long been a perplexing problem, given that the Z Fold costs nearly $2,000 and has never been "thin," but can Samsung really make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> thin <em>and</em> give it an award-winning camera?</p><p>Yes, absolutely, and two other ultra-thin foldables are proof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">review of the Oppo Find N5</a>, which is currently the thinnest phone in the world <em>and</em> a book style foldable like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Harish said "the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself." Even Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> with its 200MP camera sensor proves it's possible.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-big-charger-upgrade-databse-listing-rumor">the upcoming Honor Magic V5</a> is set to be the most direct competitor to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and is said to be at least as thin as Samsung's phone, I thought it would be fun to take last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and test its cameras against the best flagship cameras of 2025. The results show that Samsung can deliver a truly stunning flagship camera experience on its upcoming ultra-thin foldable if it really wants to.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-primary-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Primary cameras</span></h2><p>The Honor Magic V3 comes in at 4.4mm thin unfolded and sports a sizable camera island around back with a 50MP main sensor. Honor has impressed us with its photography prowess over the past few years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">particularly with motion capture capabilities</a>, including a powerful suite of software tricks behind it.</p><p>So we'll begin in the late spring garden, which is still full of flowers and vibrant colors.</p><div ><table><caption>Primary camera specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Phone</p></th><th  ><p>Primary camera</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.56" Sony IMX906</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.3" Omnivision OV50H</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.4" Sony LYT-808</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.3" Samsung ISOCELL HP2</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If I had to choose one main attribute to critique the Honor Magic V3's photos, it's that they're often underexposed, and the dynamic range is a bit lacking when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. All three phones use different sensors for the main camera.

It uses a lower megapixel count than the other four phones I pitted it against and, oddly enough, no one seems to know what sensor Honor used here. The company doesn't usually divulge its camera sensors, and the usual software tools I use to find out don't want to tell me, either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ultrawide camera sensor specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Phone</p></th><th  ><p>Ultrawide camera</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></td><td  ><p>40MP (sensor model and size unknown)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.88" Omnivision OV50D</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.76" Samsung ISOCELL JN5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.5" Samsung ISOCELL JN3</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Honor Magic V3's ultrawide camera produces seriously stunning macro shots, and it's hard to tell the difference between its images and ones from the other flagship phones I tested.

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and Honor's tuning tends to lean toward cooler colors, while Samsung likes more vibrant, warm colors. I prefer Samsung's tuning in that arena, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">OnePlus 13</a> is normally quite spot on with color science on the ultrawide camera. Either way, the Magic V3 did a good job keeping up with the flagships here.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-telephoto-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Telephoto cameras</span></h2><p>Telephoto cameras have gotten really interesting over the past few years.

In the 10x shots, you can tell the Magic V3's shot is slightly softer, but on its own, I doubt anyone would notice this. The telephoto camera is quite good and does a great job of zooming in on things. Like the primary camera, this one also struggles with underexposure and dynamic range at times.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="mLFyNCNF53DMMmjGCyUpFZ" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-6x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 6x with a patch of Wisteria flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLFyNCNF53DMMmjGCyUpFZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="ukg9oKZoi8YczJGGj9udaP" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-10x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Honor Magic V3 with a butterfly at 10x" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukg9oKZoi8YczJGGj9udaP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="dDSXTfgMpScUrjDsGwZq6Z" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-10x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 10x with the Biltmore Estate's facade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDSXTfgMpScUrjDsGwZq6Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="mmPMK2vCbRQbFkpjUjQDdP" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-30x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Honor Magic V3 with a birdhouse at 30x" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmPMK2vCbRQbFkpjUjQDdP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="JuVUiKqMnkSFGLdYXzRe5Z" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-30x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 30x with the Biltmore Estate's facade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JuVUiKqMnkSFGLdYXzRe5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Zooming in beyond 10x is far less advisable, though.

The music streaming service initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-tests-new-spotify-like-lyrics-sharing-feature">began testing lyric sharing in April 2025</a>, but the tool is now widely rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users as of today, June 17 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's available on version 8.24 of the YouTube Music app for iOS and Android.</p><p>With lyric sharing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users can create a shareable card with a few lines of lyrics from the song they're currently listening to. When available, the feature adds a new floating action button to the Lyrics tab of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-musics-now-playing-controls-are-moved-around-in-latest-test">Now Playing user-interface</a> called <strong>Share</strong>. After tapping it, you can select which groupings of lyric lines you'd like to use to create the shareable card.</p><p>You can pick the background color of your lyric card, and continuing will create the finalized graphic. It'll show the song title, artist, album artwork, selected lyrics, and a subtle YouTube Music logo. It's essentially creating an image that can be saved to your device's camera roll or shared with other apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX" name="YouTube-Music-Lyric-Sharing" alt="The new lyric sharing feature in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the feature simply shares an image of your lyric card, you'll need to manually add audio to lyrics shared on your social accounts. For instance, if you wanted to add YouTube Music lyrics to your Instagram story, you'll still need to select a track for your story as you normally would in order for music to play. Otherwise, it'll only take a few taps to create and share a YouTube Music lyrics card.</p><p>Lyric sharing is available for both free and paid YouTube Music accounts running the latest version of the mobile app (version 8.24 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>).</p><p>The YouTube Music app was last updated yesterday, June 16, on both iOS and Android. However, this seems like a server-side change, so force stop your YouTube Music app if you aren't able to create lyric cards yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it did help to type "Adobe Firefly" to get the app to appear in the store's listings.</p><p>Joining this mobile app launch is Adobe's announcement of new image and video generative models. In its post, the company states it has partnered with ideogram, Luma, Pika, and runway.

The company's Alexandru Costin, vice president, generative AI, commented saying, "Ideating with Firefly Boards is like an AI-powered creative jam session, where creative professionals can riff across media types, explore ideas together and turn sparks of inspiration into production-ready concepts."</p><p>As such, Firefly Boards is picking up a "Generative Video" option. Thanks to Google, Luma AI, and Pika, users will find convenient text-to-video generation capabilities, which can be placed right into a Board. Additionally, users can now utilize Firefly Boards' AI to make "iterative edits" to images. This is done via simple text prompts. You tell the AI what you'd like to change and watch it come to life.</p><p>Lastly, Adobe is rolling out some QoL updates, such as one-click arrange. The post states users can now "instantly" arrange the content in their Board to be more presentable. "Linked Docs" is another feature that arrives, giving users the option to link their Adobe documents in Boards.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original poster (OP) showed the platform's latest alleged attempts to dissuade users from using ad blockers, which is to "throttle" their watching experience. The user posted a snapshot of an "Experiencing interruptions? Find out why" button that appears when clicking on a video.</p><p>Many users confirm that this interruption button only appears when they have an ad blocker active.</p><p>One user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mx6a49i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">offered their experience</a>, stating the video "takes a couple of seconds to load as if my bandwidth is insufficient." There is a small bit of "lag," you could say, from when you click on the video to when it begins. The player remains black for a few moments, as if you were waiting for a skippable ad to play through (normally). Furthering user suspicions about YouTube's motive is the "Find out why" link.</p><p>YouTube is sending users to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#zippy=%2Ccheck-your-extensions-including-ad-blockers">Google support page</a> that says interruptions might be caused by your extensions, such as an ad blocker.</p><h2 id="the-fight-against-ad-blockers-2">The Fight against Ad Blockers</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/theyre_slowing_down_performance_if_you_use_an">They're slowing down performance if you use an adblocker</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>There was some speculation that YouTube rolled out this cheeky way of combating ad-block users to accounts that typically use them. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mxcignl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">subsequent reports</a> state this tactic has since hit non-logged-in users with ad blockers enabled.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to YouTube about these slowdown reports. We will update this article if we hear back.</p><p>YouTube's been targeting ad blockers on its platform for a few years now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-loads-slower-on-firefox#section-update">and the idea of "slowdowns" or throttling attempts</a> is nothing new if it's actively doing so again. Users previously reported slower video experiences on YouTube in 2023, which the platform confirmed was part of its anti-adblock crusade. Some users thought it was restricted to a couple of browsers, but a Google update made it clear that YouTube had every browser with ad block enabled in its sights.</p><p>As always, YouTube remains consistent in its crusade's purpose, stating, "To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we’ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> for an ad free experience" back in 2023.</p><p>Users might also be familiar with another tactic YouTube deployed, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">would block streaming access to its platform</a> after its system flagged your ad blocker a few times.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company is ready to make the stable versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash</a> available to the public, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-model-family-expands/" target="_blank">announced</a> today. They are now generally available to users in the Gemini app, as well as in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><p>Alongside these announcements, Google also introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite today, June 17. The preview version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now available for testing, and it’s a newer alternative to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, which was made public earlier this year. Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is “our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet,” according to Google.</p><p>Compared to the other Gemini 2.5 models, the Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite preview is all about efficiency and cost-cutting. While it doesn’t perform as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro or Flash, it still holds its own in benchmark tests. It’s also significantly cheaper to run compared to the better Gemini 2.5 models, which could be appealing to developers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.41%;"><img id="Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm" name="Gemini-25-Flash-Lite" alt="Benchmark test results for the Gemini 2.5 family." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google )</span></figcaption></figure><p>“2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks,” the company explains in the blog post. “It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts.”</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite still has a one-million-token context window and multimodal input, and can integrate with services like Google Search or execute code. It’ll also support thinking budgets, so you can turn on thinking without wasting tokens.</p><p>You can try out the preview for Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite now in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. For general users, the stable versions Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash are available anywhere you’d find Gemini, including the mobile app on iOS and Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Whether it’s your phone, laptop, tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">favorite smartwatch</a> (think Galaxy Watch, Pixel Watch, or even your Apple Watch), your playlists are just a tap away from landing wherever you want them.</p><p>Prior to this update, getting music onto your smartwatch meant fiddling with your wearable's tiny screen, and it's annoying at best.

Now, you can easily oversee and organize your music library on up to five devices, all from the Spotify app on your main phone. It’s a smarter way to keep your tunes in check without hopping between devices.</p><p>Once you hit the "Manage Downloads" button in the options menu, you’ll instantly see which devices have that playlist saved offline. It’s a slick way to keep tabs on what’s eating up your five-device limit, and you can even clear out downloads right then and there.</p><p>SamMobile reports that this feature is already live on Samsung devices running One UI 7 and Galaxy Watches with Wear OS 5.0. Spotify is rolling it out slowly, so not everyone will see it immediately, but it’s definitely on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This time, prominent tipster Evan Blass posted renders of the alleged smartwatch lineup, giving us a good look at what to expect from this year's series.</p><p>Blass, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/">in his newsletter</a>, posted three images of the upcoming<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, showing off their design and potential colorways. Right off the bat, Blass says that the Korean OEM could launch this year's series as a trio consisting of the standard Galaxy Watch 8, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as the new Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025).</p><p>Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak">similar images cropped up online</a> showing off the trio's design as well as some of its physical buttons. But this is the first time the new Ultra model is being referred to as the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025). Blass' renders imply that all three watches will sport a squircle design.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>To start, the standard Galaxy Watch 8 could allegedly show up in a smoother, less noisy square-ish silver base topped by a circular dial. The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>The renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. It gives us a clear look at two buttons on one side, flanking a smaller orange button, also rumored to be the "Quick" button, possibly giving users access to apps that they use often. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), as the tipster calls it, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p>While these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt, the Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this summer during Samsung's Unpacked, which<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> isn't too far away</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The main demand is "Make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller," and doing both is an obvious "challenge."</p><p>Ingham concluded that there will be a "broad set of categories" for AR glasses, from 30-degree displays for notification windows to 70-degree displays for full-on entertainment, and from cloud-based AI through your phone to a "full computer on your head."

He described a range of potential AR "market segments":</p><ul><li>Monocolor AR glasses with basic, subtle text function</li><li>Full-color single-display glasses like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR prototype</a></li><li>Binocular, full FoV glasses like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> or Snap Spectacles with higher power demands and "bigger form factors"</li><li>Affordable "smart goggles" like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> that don't need to "look like regular glasses"</li><li>Full optical see-through (OST) headsets like the Hololens</li></ul><p>What Kress didn't say is that this nebulousness makes it very difficult to imagine AR glasses' future, because it's far too complicated for non-techies to understand.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> also have a range of form factors.

As long as your "reality is augmented," it could be audio, visual, or any other sensory changes. By that definition, Meta AI glasses are "AR glasses," which is questionable.</p><p>Kress took a different perspective. For him, AR glasses must have a display, but must also offer "something that cannot be replaced by audio." Multimodal AI — the killer app for smart glasses that analyzes what you see — might benefit from a display, but it already works without one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-6" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Android XR prototype glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kress, who worked on the original Google Glass, explained that once the novelty wore off, consumers had "no real use for it."

Kress believes the visual component only becomes necessary when you can achieve "World Locking," where 6DoF tracking and a visual positioning system let glasses accurately point to a specific, physical element of your world. Right now, the Android XR UI can only hover in empty space.</p><p>You also need affordable, power-efficient microLEDs to display the data clearly and efficiently, Kress noted. But software is the key. It's an unsurprising perspective from a Google engineer, given the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">focus on Android XR</a> while leaving hardware to Samsung and others.</p><h2 id="meta-if-they-build-ar-hardware-consumers-will-come-2">Meta: If they build AR hardware, consumers will come</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-2" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta's Ingham had a more hardware- and economic-driven perspective on AR glasses' future: Smart glasses need to become mainstream first, or AR glasses have no chance.</p><p>Meta has sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">two million smart glasses</a>, and total glasses sales "better be in double digits" — meaning tens of millions — by 2027, Ingham says, or that's a warning sign for the category.</p><p>She explained how OEMs like Apple and Google need to join Meta with consumer smart glasses to make retailers like Best Buy and Target treat smart glasses as a "whole category."

And they're improving smart glasses' pain points like weight, audio quality, more variety of styles (especially for women), and a lower cost.</p><p>The one obvious pain point she ignored was battery life, and I found that telling.

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Faster-smoother-camera-timeline/ba-p/722288">community update</a>, Google states v3.33 of the app is rolling out now on Android and will address the laggy and, at times, low FPS experience that its camera timeline previously suffered. Specifically, Google says v3.33 "substantially improved" the framerate and loading performance for users.</p><p>Now, users scrolling through the camera timeline to view old events <em>should </em>find an easier, smoother time. The improvements made to scrubbing through the video's timeline should make it easier for users to spot anything of importance, as the old laggy experience might've made this difficult.</p><p>Google adds that this update cuts down on timeline loading times and "frozen" moments.</p><p>The Home app update also brings a "limited access member tier."

What's immediately highlighted is the company's use of a 1-3-4 core architecture for the supposed Dimensity 9500 SoC. The listing claims the chip possesses a single core at 3.23GHz, which is surprising, but there may be a reason for this.</p><p>The Geekbench listing adds that the Dimensity 9500 contains three cores clocked at 3.03GHz and four cores at 2.23GHz.</p><p>After taking the platform's CL benchmark test, the chip allegedly received a score of 15,717.</p><p>Moreover, a comment on the tipster's thread on X highlights a new development: the existence of a Mali-G1-Ultra GPU. It appears that this GPU is from Arm; however, it's not the typical Immortatlis GPU we've seen consistently in recent history for SoCs.</p><h2 id="mediatek-s-next-flagship-2">MediaTek's next flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dimensity 9500 pic.twitter.com/zOgxUdnLrH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1934419737959882899">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>These rumored early specs for MediaTek's next flagship Dimensity are strange, especially considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the Dimensity 9400's power</a>. The current generation's flagship features the same 1-3-4 core setup at 3.62GHz, 3.3GHz, and 2.4GHz, respectively. Moreover, it features a 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU. We're still waiting to see more about this new graphics processor; the 9500 chip is supposedly rocking.</p><p>Though it's strange — the difference in power — the publication claims this is likely due to the early testing stage. More specifically, it says these lower clock speeds "clearly indicate it is not performing as per spec." In reality, it wouldn't make sense for MediaTek to release a "next-gen" flagship SoC that's weaker than last year's flagship. It would feel more like a mid-range chip in that case.</p><p>So, we'll most likely have to wait a little while longer before we see the true power of the Dimensity 9500, which the post claims will "trade blows" with Qualcomm's next Elite SoC.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that MediaTek launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> SoC earlier this year. This model takes things up a notch over the original 9400 chip. For its single core, the chip clocks in at 3.73GHz, so it seems MediaTek is really trying to push toward the 4GHz mark.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Spotted first by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/16/google-play-slide-buy/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this “Slide to buy” feature is now live across the whole digital lineup, such as apps, books, movies, you name it.</p><p>This change appears to be rolling out wide with Play Store version 46.5.19-31.

Seeing this problem, Google has stepped in to fix it. What used to be a quick checkout had a downside—people clicking “buy” by mistake. This new slide move is Google's way of cutting down those oops moments for good.</p><p>With this change, now you have to swipe sideways to confirm before the usual password or fingerprint step kicks in. This new slide-to-buy gesture works the same whether you’re grabbing a one-off app or signing up for a subscription through the Play Store.</p><p>This swipe move is a solid upgrade, especially for people who’ve dialed back or turned off purchase checks. It’s a smart way to make buying stuff a whole lot less stressful, and honestly, we’re all here for it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The problem is that they can also be quite expensive, so many folks wait for a good discount to come along before they make their final decision.

You&apos;ll also get all of the fitness tracking features that have made Garmin famous, such as over 30 pre-installed activity modes, stress tracking, sleep coach, and comprehensive 24/7 health monitoring. Furthermore, the Epix Gen 2 comes packed with some modern features you might not expect, including multi-band GPS and topographical mapping. </p><p>So what&apos;s the catch? Well, for starters, the Epix Gen 2 came out in 2022 and has since been supplanted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin&apos;s Fenix 8</a> as the leading premium smartwatch from the brand.

After all, if you have a budget of around 500 bucks and you&apos;re not particular about brand names, why not just buy the newer Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YLBBMB"><strong>while it&apos;s on sale for $469 at Amazon?</strong></a></p><p>But, on the other hand, if you want the experience of using a powerful Garmin watch without spending around $1,000 on the latest and greatest model, the Epix Gen 2 is a great pick, and this deal might be exactly what you&apos;re looking for. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, the tech giant is tapping the telephoto lens to boost close-up shots even more, according to a fresh leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-tele-macro-camera" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>.</p><p>This move makes sense when you consider how each lens focuses—telephoto needs more space, while ultrawide gets real close. So, with the Pixel 10, Google is making it smart enough to pick the right lens on the fly depending on how near your subject is.</p><p>At present, Pixel phones mostly rely on the ultrawide lens for macro shots, thanks to some smart engineering tweaks like autofocus that help nail those close-up details. And from the looks of it, that setup isn’t going anywhere with the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="telephoto-s-macro-perks-2">Telephoto’s macro perks</h2><p>Compared to ultrawide lenses, telephoto lenses have some nifty perks for macro shots. They give you a nice, creamy background blur thanks to a shallower depth of field, which is ideal for making your subject pop. Plus, they avoid the funky distortions ultrawide shooters sometimes bring when you get up close.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether this new telephoto-powered macro feature will be available across the whole Pixel 10 lineup. But with the official reveal just a couple months out, we won’t be waiting long to find out.</p><p>On top of beefed-up macro shots, the Pixel 10 is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">step up its video stabilization</a>. According to an earlier report, the phone's upgraded stabilization could rival a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 gimbal, meaning you might get buttery-smooth, pro-level footage straight from your phone, with no extra gear needed.</p><h2 id="triple-camera-shakeup-2">Triple-camera shakeup?</h2><p>Adding more fuel to the hype, early leaks hinted that the base Pixel 10 might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/camera-specs-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-hinting-at-a-significant-downgrade">ditch the Pixel 9’s two-camera setup for a fresh triple-camera lineup</a>. Typically, regular versions stick to a wide and ultrawide lens, but the Pixel 10 looks set to shake things up by adding a telephoto lens as a third player.</p><p>To make room for it, Google is reportedly tweaking the sensor setup, which might mean some fresh changes to the wide and ultrawide cameras too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To help businesses grow, the Meta-owned service is launching "Ads in Status." With this new feature, the post states its purpose is to "encourage" better/quicker communication between potential new customers and the business in question.</p><p>WhatsApp published a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://business.whatsapp.com/whatsapp-ads">business-focused page</a>, stating people who have created a Channel for their business can also utilize it.</p><p>The platform states the ads it provides were built with "privacy in mind." To display ads you might be interested in, WhatsApp states it does collect limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see." However, WhatsApp reiterates its commitment to keeping your texts, calls, and statuses private through end-to-end encryption (E2EE).</p><p>Joining "Ads in Status" is WhatsApp's new "Promoted Channels" feature. As previously stated, the app will use some limited data on you to determine what content you <em>might </em>be interested in seeing/interacting with. These promoted channels will appear when browsing your Update tab's "Channel" category.</p><h2 id="making-business-moves-2">Making Business Moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.48%;"><img id="88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi" name="whats-app-update-tab-channel-subscriptions" alt="WhatsApp introduces Channel Subscriptions via the Updates tab, which let users conveniently see exclusive updates from places they've subscribed to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="778" height="595" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure><p>WhatsApp is bringing one more feature to its Updates tab in June, called "Channel Subscriptions." Now, if there's a channel making content you enjoy, WhatsApp is letting you (and them) offer support for "exclusive updates" for a monthly fee. These fees will likely be left up to the admin of the channel that's offering exclusive content for its subscribers.</p><p>These three updates were announced today (June 16), so they should've started rolling out already. However, it might take a little while, so just ensure WhatsApp is updated on your phone or tablet as the week continues.</p><p>Rolling out business-focused content updates isn't anything new for WhatsApp, as the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-updates-app-e-commerce-features">brought in-app shopping capabilities</a> a while ago. This was an update in 2023 that let users purchase items from merchants in WhatsApp through its business platform. The service made its payment functions easier and also implemented a verification process to bring users some comfort. Elsewhere, in the past few months, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-generative-ai-business-tools-launch">Meta discussed new business tools</a> that use generative AI.</p><p>Essentially, business owners and advertisers could utilize generative AI to create images and text. A test for this started on Facebook and Instagram late last year, with WhatsApp in its sights.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The names could correlate, at least in part, to the models' respective sizes.</p><p>Galagos, for instance, are known for their small size. That's the alleged reference for the smallest Pixel 12 member, the base model.

Since then, we've seen references to cats, dogs, and reptiles. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">Google Pixel 10 series is said to be codenamed after horses</a>, and the next Pixel 11 generation is rumored to be codenamed after bears. Now, Mystic Leaks believes the further-out Pixel 12 lineup will be named after primates.</p><p>Of course, these codenames are strictly for internal development use. But like old-fashioned Android codenames, they serve as fun ways to track the progress of future Google Pixel hardware. For now, these references don't reveal much about the company's plan for its 2027 lineup of flagship Android smartphones.</p><p>It does seem to indicate that Google plans to keep the Pixel lineup roughly as-is in terms of offerings and sizes. If the company wanted to add a different-sized base model flagship, we might've seen five leaked codenames instead of four. The same could be true if Google planned to introduce a flip-style foldable to pair with the Google Pixel Fold series.</p><p>However, it's always possible that Google has tricks up its sleeve, so we can't rule anything out based on rumored codenames alone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then, a comprehensive training plan is believed to be generated further, helping users to support their preferred marathon runs.</p><h2 id="antioxidant-index-2">Antioxidant Index</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Antioxidant-Index" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the Antioxidant Index feature on Galaxy Watch will be able to measure carotenoids — "antioxidants found in green and orange fruits and vegetables — that are stored in the skin." It is said to be utilizing an industry-first feature to assess carotenoid levels in about five seconds, backed by an advanced, light-activated BioActive sensor.</p><p>All these insights supposedly reflect behavioral changes. The aim of the feature is to tackle radicals in the body caused by behavioral factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, for example. Antioxidants, on the other hand, will neutralize those free radicals in order to prevent chronic illness. Thus, the feature with the ability to measure carotenoid antioxidants helps Galaxy Watch users adopt healthier habits.</p><h2 id="galaxy-watch-5-series-and-above-2">Galaxy Watch 5 series and above</h2><p>These advanced features are available for Galaxy Watch users who are willing to try out the One UI 8 Watch beta. However, some features like Vascular Load are available only on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 models.

Meta teased the new partnership on social media, creating a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/oakleymeta/">Instagram Oakley Meta account</a>, teasing that "the next evolution is coming on June 20."</p><p>We first heard about a potential Oakley Meta partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">back in January</a>. Leaks suggested a new pair of smart glasses was in development, dubbed "Supernova 2," a direct follow-up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, which feature the code name "Supernova."</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses feature a camera on the left side of the frame, while Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are rumored to feature a camera in the center.</p><p>Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are also rumored to use Oakley Sphaera frames. I created a mock-up above using Sphaera frames and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-eye">Xreal Eye camera</a> centered just under the nose bridge, similar to how Xreal positions it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> series smart glasses.</p><p>While we don't have official imagery of these new Oakley glasses just yet, this should give you an idea of how they might look.</p><h2 id="sportier-than-ray-bans-2">Sportier than Ray-Bans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2 HUD</a> smart glasses, which look similar to many Oakley styles. ENGO 2 HUD features a small screen to help athletes keep track of stats without having to look down at a watch, but we don't expect Meta to pack a display into Oakley Meta Smart Glasses. Instead, it's far more likely that these Oakley frames will be designed for streaming and recording footage as their main function.</p><p>If Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are anything like the Ray-Ban Metas, they'll feature the battery and other electronics in the arms rather than on the nose bridge as ENGO did. While it's possible that Meta could outfit its new Oakley-branded smart glasses with fitness-focused extras like a heart rate monitor, we haven't seen credible rumors yet suggesting that as a possibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We do expect Oakley Meta Smart Glasses to be a better fit for athletes than Ray-Ban Metas, though. Android Central's Michael Hicks recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">ran a marathon with Ray-Ban Metas</a> and found that, while the functionality was excellent, the fit wasn't quite right for running. Oakley Meta Smart Glasses should fix this with a design that's better suited for athletic activities, including running, cycling, and other sports.</p><p>We fully expect Meta to introduce a third generation of Ray-Ban Meta glasses later this year, as well, which are said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">to include a display</a> in one of the lenses. But we probably won't see these until Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><p>For now, Oakley Meta Smart Glasses will be the first big commercial smart glasses announcement from Meta in 2025. Given that Ray-Ban Metas sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">2 million units and counting</a>, we're curious how Oakley Meta glasses will match up for popularity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The rumors of the device have been swirling around for the past two years. While we have seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE earlier, it is interesting to see the device finally seeing the light of day, according to these recent certifications.</p><p>The expected specifications of the Galaxy Z Flip FE include a 6.7-inch foldable 120Hz screen coupled with a 3.4-inch cover screen. Underneath, the foldable device is expected to ship with an Exynos 2400e chipset paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. For optics, it could have a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 10MP shooter for selfies. It is likely to have One UI 8 (Android 16) on board and feature a 4000mAh battery.</p><p>Alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, Samsung will also introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> Galaxy Watch 8</a> series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, most likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">happening in early July</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Most GaN chargers tend to be squarish, but the flatter profile clearly makes a difference in this regard. And like the best chargers, the UltraSlim utilizes GaN tech to good effect, delivering reliable USB PD charging in a diminutive size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the charger.

It does a good job with Samsung devices as well thanks to PPS, and because you get two ports, there's a total 70W power budget (35W max with each port) when both are in use. If you're using it with a phone and any accessory, it switches to 45W + 20W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't need more than two USB-C charging ports, the UltraSlim is a great travel charger; it's much smaller than its mainstream rivals, and 45W charging out of each port is ideal if you're using Pixel or Galaxy devices.

Right off the bat, you’ll see a big preview of your watch and its current face. Just below that, key information like battery level, last sync time, and connection status is front and center. There’s even a handy “Sync now” button tucked in the top-right corner for quick refreshes.</p><h2 id="familiar-but-cleaner-layout-2">Familiar, but cleaner layout</h2><p>Right under your Fitbit’s preview, you’ll see neatly organized cards for Watch Faces, Apps, and Tiles. These are straight out of the Pixel Watch app playbook. The layout has gained a fresh coat of paint, but don’t expect anything wild—those cards still lead to the same settings you’ve been using.</p><p>Even the main settings menu got a fresh coat of paint. On a Fitbit Sense 2, for instance, you’ll now spot organized sections like Notifications, Device Preferences, Google Services (Wallet and Maps), Fitbit Reminders & Alerts, Tips & Support, System, and Smart Features like Alexa and on-wrist calls.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="material-3-expressive-makeover-incoming-2">Material 3 Expressive makeover incoming</h2><p>Outside of the device settings revamp, Google is also prepping the Fitbit app for a full Material 3 Expressive makeover. The classic Steps view isn’t going anywhere, but you’ll notice a few slick upgrades, like a floating action button for Gemini popping up next to the toolbar. That toolbar is getting a tweak too, ditching the top tabs for a cleaner layout to switch between Day, Week, Month, and Year views.</p><p>Google has been tightening up the Fitbit app in the past few months. One of the bigger changes came early last year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-sleep-view-redesign">Sleep tracking got a major revamp</a>. Instead of bouncing between screens, you now get everything — last night’s sleep breakdown, your overall score, and a full timeline — all in one scroll-free view.</p><p>Back in March, Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/fitbits-health-metrics-are-getting-a-redesign-on-android-and-ios">gave its Health Metrics page a makeover</a> to match the app’s overall feel. As part of the revamp, it ditched the separate “Today” and “Trends” tabs and rolled everything into one unified view.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On top of that, a fresh leak just spilled the beans on a potentially brand-new camera setup in the works.</p><p>Tipster Digital Chat Station claims on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PwM6XAI07" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 15 is kicking off a whole new chapter for the brand’s cameras. Instead of continuing its partnership with Hasselblad, this one is supposedly rocking OnePlus’ very own imaging setup for the first time in a very long while.</p><p>If this switch-up is correct, it throws the future of the OnePlus–Hasselblad duo into serious doubt, a partnership that kicked off with the OnePlus 9 and put the brand among our top choices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. It’s too early to say how things will play out, but there’s no denying the collaboration paid off, especially in color accuracy and portrait mode. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> was reaping the benefits.</p><h2 id="camera-specs-get-messy-2">Camera specs get messy</h2><p>The latest leak also points to a triple 50MP setup on the back, consisting of the main wide, ultra-wide, and a 3x periscope zoom. But not everyone is on the same page about the OnePlus 15’s camera specs. Tipster Smart Pikachu earlier claimed it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks">might pack a 200MP periscope lens</a>, instead of 50MP.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is also expected to pack the SM8550 chip, which is the follow-up to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While the official name isn’t certain yet, chances are it'll land as the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KKPidQo6wrHHkgYXNt4S" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKPidQo6wrHHkgYXNt4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If the leaks are on point, the OnePlus 15 might rock a flat screen similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>.

The OnePlus Pad Lite is tailored for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a> segment and touted to be the successor to the company's first budget tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go, launched in 2023.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

It includes a single rear camera at the back, and the front should have a 11-inch LCD display. It is expected to come in 1920 x 1080 resolution with a 90Hz refresh.</p><p>Underneath, the Pad Lite is likely to include a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset with 2.2GHz clock speeds paired with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage — with more options available during the launch. The tablet is also touted with a 9340mAh battery capacity — a significant improvement over the predecessor, which had 8000mAh.</p><p>The tablet is believed to be coming with a 5MP rear camera next to a 5MP front-facing camera. However, the predecessor had offered 8MP cameras each. The expected dimensions comprise 254.9 x 166.5 x 7.4mm and weigh around 539 grams. Overall, the device should feel a bit taller, wider, and thinner than the previous iteration.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:819px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.26%;"><img id="wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-01" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="819" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.71%;"><img id="9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-02" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="launch-still-unclear-2">Launch still unclear</h2><p>The OnePlus Pad Lite could be carrying an Aero Blue colorway with a folio cover accessory also complementary to the tablet's cover.

Instead, I found out the hard way what happens when you ignore Garmin's algorithm.</p><p>I spent May in a bit of a running slump, my mileage dipping about 40 miles from my monthly average. So I decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-need-a-fitness-reboot-this-summer-your-smartwatch-has-the-tools-you-need">rebound in June</a> with more steps and miles. I kicked things off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">half marathon while wearing Ray-Ban Metas</a> on June 1, and then I decided that I could do another hard, hilly run on Global Running Day with a local running group.</p><p>By the end of my 7-mile run, I'd fallen behind the group and felt physically weak with a tight right hamstring. I checked my watch later and found I was right above my body's running tolerance.</p><p>But since I desperately wanted to rejuvenate my fitness efforts, I went out for a low-aerobic jog a couple of days later once my training readiness score had climbed up a bit. It was a mistake: Even if my heart and lungs felt fine, my hamstring all but gave out on me. I ended up limping home. A week of recovery and a busy travel week at an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">XR convention</a> later, I'm back where I started.</p><p>The experience taught me two things: Garmin's running tolerance estimate is legitimate, and I truly hope it doesn't remain restricted to Garmin's $750 running watch like other "premium" tools.</p><h2 id="how-garmin-running-tolerance-works-2">How Garmin Running Tolerance works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uZaqu5Qyk9ptcvAwY3yBsC" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-miles-widget-graphic" alt="Render of the Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the user's Acute Impact Load miles (48.1), Tolerance (52 miles/week), and Actual 7d miles (43.3)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZaqu5Qyk9ptcvAwY3yBsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2133" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin says Running Tolerance helps you "recognize potentially hazardous training patterns" and "intelligently manage the impact of running on your body as you work to build and maintain mileage."</p><p>It builds off of acute load, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> effect on your body from the past seven days of workouts, which most Garmin Forerunner models track. But this metric focuses on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), rather than the<em> </em><strong>biomechanical</strong> load.</p><p>That's where Running Tolerance changes things. For each run, it takes into account your weight, speed, intensity, ground contact time, cadence, and significant uphills and downhills, among other concerns.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ozDBXcjHcBz96FYZkRaZW7" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-miles-track-workout" alt="A post-run "Impact Load" widget showing the actual mileage (2 mi) and impact load (3.8 mi) of a track workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozDBXcjHcBz96FYZkRaZW7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A hard track workout put nearly twice the strain on my body as a normal 2-mile run </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The goal is to track the "force exerted by the ground on your body." And a speedy downhill run, for example, might be "three times harder than an easy run on level ground." And you might not normally realize it, because the run felt easy on your lungs.</p><p>Garmin then judges your acute impact load miles against your running tolerance, based on your recent running history. It warns you if you've entered a "cautionary state" where you should be careful of injury or burnout.</p><p>It's separate from Garmin's typical post-run recovery estimate because it takes more than your cardiovascular system into account. And that's vital context for runners!</p><p>Of course, most semi-serious runners will show better impulse control than I did and stop themselves when their bodies tell them to. But running tolerance is still critical for anyone trying to take their training to the next level.</p><h2 id="beginner-runners-need-this-more-than-veterans-2">Beginner runners need this more than veterans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ohdBtUHeHoZxinE6FMpMPk" name="Garmin-acute-impact-load-weekly-limit-widget" alt="The Garmin Acute Impact Load miles widget on the Garmin Forerunner 970, showing the runner's weekly impact load miles against their weekly tolerance and actual weekly mileage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohdBtUHeHoZxinE6FMpMPk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Knowing your body's upper limit is the kind of context all runners need, from pros to couch-to-5Kers. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's whole wearable strategy is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">price-locking software</a>, such as how the Forerunner 970 gets offline maps but the 570 doesn't, or how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a> uses training load data in the background to create daily suggested workouts but blocks you from seeing the widget. It makes you pay extra for the best tools.</p><p>And fine, if Garmin wants to lock maps, real-time stamina, Strava Live Segments, and endurance scores to the premium models like the 970 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, we just have to accept that.</p><p>But running tolerance is <em>designed</em> to prevent injuries by warning people off who don't know their limits. And I'd argue that it's more important for couch-to-5K runners or casual runners to see that their body isn't ready for a half marathon, or that they've hit their weekly limit and need to ease off to avoid injury.</p><p>Are casual runners going to spend $750 on a running watch? No, and they shouldn't! Not until they're advanced enough to take full advantage of the features. But the weekly running tolerance limit doesn't feel "advanced" to me; it feels fundamental.</p><p>I shouldn't have ignored my running tolerance data, but at least I was forewarned. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners don't get that context. So while I find it unlikely based on Garmin's track record, I'm hoping Garmin's running tolerance eventually trickles down to more watches and helps people prevent injuries!</p> ]]></dc:content>

At their booth, I wore a lightweight surgical HMD and a night-vision AR helmet for soldiers' targeting and guidance. I also checked out their ultra-bright microLED display, the in-vogue tech for AR glasses and smartwatches.</p><p>But Kopin's most promising tech for consumers is its NeuralDisplay. It uses "traditional RGB pixels, image-sensing pixels, and advanced signal processing algorithms" to track your eye movement and neurological response in a functional VR display.</p><p>I saw the tech in action at AWE (and you can see a video example below). The Kopin engineer shone a flashlight into his eye, and the display immediately detected his pupil dilation and adjusted the brightness and contrast to prevent any discomfort.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipqm5IJNVSE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The version they showed off at AWE, built on OLED but compatible with microLED, can adjust the display's content automatically to match the user's gaze and simulate depth.</p><p>It can track data like the user's blinking rate to judge if the person is fatigued or enable foveated rendering, all without needing any SoC processing power. And in the case of military applications (or FPS games), this tech could determine that the user isn't looking in the direction of a threat and guide their gaze that way.</p><p>It's still an in-progress prototype that needs silicon improvements to enable better color accuracy and sensitivity. But CEO Michael Murray said that they proved wrong the naysayers who "said we couldn't pull it off," and that companies like Meta, Apple, and Anduril will be very interested in licensing their patent so that they can shed the weight of their eye-tracking cameras. We'll see if this happens!</p><h2 id="viture-s-redacted-xr-glasses-and-switch-2-gaming-2">Viture's [REDACTED] XR glasses and Switch 2 gaming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed" name="Viture-XR-Pro-Glasses-and-Switch-2" alt="The Nintendo Switch 2 sitting on a table with Viture Pro XR glasses sitting above it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have to be vague about this entry, as Viture — maker of XR gaming glasses like the Viture Pro XR — showed me its next-generation glasses at AWE but told me I couldn't reveal anything except to "tease" readers and "get them excited for what's coming."</p><p>To avoid any trouble, I'll quote without comment this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/exclusive-viture-is-teasing-next-gen-xr-glasses-heres-what-we-know-about-them">Tom's Guide article</a> noting that the next Viture XR glasses will "be the first to use Sony's latest Micro-OLED panels" with a "sharper, brighter and wider field of view than the current Pros' 46-degree FoV.

They have 1.5 million pre-mapped locations already, and they offer "private VPS" for companies to make their own AR educational tours; I'd imagine it working well for a museum, or a theme park like Disneyland.</p><p>The demo itself was a bit finicky. Dot occasionally refused to answer my questions, blathering on about whatever it <em>thought</em> I was next to. The Snap Spectacles battery reached critical lows after about 15 minutes of Q&A, with the display struggling with the sunny weather; it's hard to say when AR glasses hardware will be ready for a city tour. But when it worked, it worked very well, and I could see both kids and curious adults loving this software...once the AR hardware is ready for it.</p><h2 id="sony-s-premium-xyn-headset-2">Sony's premium XYN headset</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mCu6hrLY6LxKW4fjqzbFZd" name="Sony-XYN-headset" alt="The Sony XYN headset with finger and ring controllers sitting on a grey table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mCu6hrLY6LxKW4fjqzbFZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Sony XYN (pronounced "zin"), like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan</a>, has the premium Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset with tons of RAM and micro-OLED quality. If I hadn't already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">demoed Moohan last month</a>, the insane 3552×3840 resolution would have blown my mind. But being able to get up close to a virtual book page and read every word without straining, or examine the details of a painting, is still beyond what any current VR headset can offer.</p><p>Sony also showed off subtle finger controllers that you can squeeze to select and move spatial content. Hand tracking works pretty well on most recent headsets like the Quest and Vision Pro, but having a wearable controller adds more precision so you're not vainly struggling with missed camera inputs while trying to work.</p><p>Almost no one will end up using Sony's premium XYN headset; it's designed for "spatial content creation," meaning only enterprise users willing to drop nearly five grand to create CADs will need one. But it's still a promising sign of how immersive XR headsets are getting, and I love the flip-up display design for productivity.</p><h2 id="android-xr-smart-ring-controls-2">Android XR smart ring controls</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd" name="Android-XR-smart-ring-controls-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a Kiwear smart ring capable of gesture controls, using it to slice fruit in Fruit Ninja on a tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the Qualcomm show booth, they had a space for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250610859777/en/KiWear-Unveils-Smart-Ring-Input-Solution-for-AI-Glasses-in-Collaboration-with-Qualcomm-at-AWE-USA-2025">KiWear</a>, a smart ring reference design for gesture controls for AR, XR, and smart glasses. And it's surprisingly accurate and intuitive.</p><p>Connected to RayNeo X3 Pro glasses, the ring could control the display UI using simple finger movements or rotations around your finger. The IMU could differentiate between pinches away from or towards you for different functions, and the built-in PPG could display health data on the glasses.</p><p>You can also reach the ring out to tap virtual objects or use the ring touchpad to select or scroll. It even worked for accurate gaming controls when playing Fruit Ninja.</p><p>Given that Qualcomm announced that Android XR will support smart ring controls, I wonder if the next Samsung Galaxy Ring will be more specifically designed for XR controls to pair with Moohan and its smart glasses. I was never sold on the idea of a smart ring controller, but the KiWear ring's accuracy changed my mind.</p><h2 id="all-the-other-awe-2025-highlights-2">All the other AWE 2025 highlights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2874px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="P5iCqmc7nngBwL4oqdWZmd" name="bhaptics-vest-and-gloves-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a bHaptics vest and haptic gloves for VR gaming." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5iCqmc7nngBwL4oqdWZmd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2874" height="1617" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>bHaptics' TactSuit Pro and TactGloves</strong> add haptics support for over 100 Meta Quest games, including many of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">favorite VR titles</a>.

For example, color passthrough on the Quest 3 can be useful when you want to retain some awareness of your surroundings while you're flailing about playing Beat Saber. However, it does have its limitations.</p><p>If you're like me, you likely have your phone with you at all times and check it frequently. The problem with VR is that even with passthrough, it's not always easy to see what's on your screen. And if you're really like me, then you're probably blind as a bat but too stubborn to use your glasses with your VR headset, making the passthrough view even more challenging to use when trying to read text on your phone display.</p><p>Fortunately, Motorola has a solution for Quest 3 and Quest 3S owners that lets you use your phone on your VR headset. It can come in pretty handy, although it's not without its quirks, and not everyone will have access to it.</p><h2 id="what-is-smart-connect-2">What is Smart Connect?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-Smart-Connect-VR-headset" alt="VR Headset option in Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect app</a> on the Meta Quest 3 earlier this year as an easy way to stream and control your phone from within your headset.

Of course, it goes without saying that you'll need a Motorola phone for this to work.</p><p>First, you have to download the Smart Connect app from the Horizon Store.

You can select from just about any app on your phone to stream to the headset, and it'll open in a phone-like view. You can also use your phone to open any app on your VR headset by swiping up and sending it to Smart Connect.</p><p>What's great about this is that you can regularly scroll, view videos, and even send messages straight from your headset. You can also have up to three open and active apps in one window and easily move between them. You can also resize some apps by rotating or using the resize button up top, which can open certain apps like Gmail in a tablet-like view. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and not every app will scale properly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3363px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ" name="11964c1dcda851b9432c811baba04858" alt="Streaming multiple apps via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3363" height="1891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3020px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ" name="f8e0ca67dfb25cce9b33915afebfc6e9" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3020" height="1698" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ" name="dfbb86b9b5ee5875ff54447f6b66f6cb" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3054" height="1718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some apps, such as Instagram, you may be better off using the native Quest app, as it's more optimized for the VR display than the Smart Connect version.

It's a much more limited experience than the normal Quest keyboard, so you don't have options like swiping to type or word suggestions. That means, when you make a mistake, there's no easy way to correct it without going back or deleting.</p><p>The problem is, the keyboard view and what's on the app don't always sync up correctly. If I move the cursor back to correct a word on the keyboard view, the cursor in the app will stay in place and start deleting or adding words at the end of my sentence. So it'll look correct on the keyboard but not on the app. I can always move the cursor in the app to correct the word, but then it won't do the same on the keyboard view.</p><p>The only way I found I could get around the typing experience is to just use the Gboard's voice typing, which comes in clutch. However, this is only accessible in the app view, not on the Quest keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP" name="e6197be6ba13efe52bff9824a81dfd73" alt="Google Messages and Gboard voice typing via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1801" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But perhaps my biggest problem is scaling.

To exit a full-screen app in this mode, swipe down from the top of the window until a bar appears, then click the <strong>X</strong> button.</p><p>It's not the most intuitive experience, and unfortunately, many of these issues have been carried over from the desktop version of Smart Connect.</p><h2 id="a-decent-start-2">A decent start</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ" name="12939c99808dacb222108051a33516b3" alt="Smart Connect app streaming while Beat Saber is paused on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3650" height="2053" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate having to fully interrupt my VR immersion by removing the headset to check my phone.

A bad water leak inside my home means I have to replace some of my electrical wiring and almost all of my cable internet equipment as well as the water heater. Since I'm using a well, there was no usage spike on the meter to warn me I had a problem so it's hard to tell how long this has gone on, but it made one hell of a mess. What a way to start a week.</p><p>I spent the time installing one coaxial cable to a dry spot so I could reconnect my internet service. I work from home and it's vital I have it because working at McDonald's is ... well ... terrible. I appreciate them allowing me to come in and spend the afternoon and they even gave me a free coffee. You'll find some good people in the country; what you won't find is adequate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/2021-needs-focus-rural-5g-help-save-my-terrible-broadband-experience">high-speed internet</a>.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>I have the "choice" of one internet provider. Ignore what you hear about competition laws and rules because they have never mattered here. My internet provider needs to replace some of their equipment (just a glorified coaxial connector) attached to my home. They will be able to do it on Wednesday. Until then, I'm left on my own. It's not the provider's fault that water damaged everything. I also understand they can't send a technician out into the woods to service one person if they're busy. My understanding doesn't help my situation.</p><p>Where all this becomes a problem is cellular coverage. Remember all the promises of nationwide wireless broadband and how it was coming thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing">miracle of 5G</a>? It was a lie. I do have cell service at my house but it's not nearly fast enough to be useful for anyone who works from home. As for the "choice" of wireless providers? Mine is T-Mobile or one of several MVNOs that use T-Mobile's infrastructure. I even drove into town and grabbed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-home-internet-review">Home Internet kit</a> because someone thought it might be fast enough, but it's not.</p><p>I choose to live here because I like it here. But it's high time everyone realizes that rural communities have been told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">promise after promise</a> of how they would be brought into the 21st century with adequate information access and it never happens. Forget all the commercials and testimonials companies like to show you because all you <em>really</em> need to do is ask someone who lives it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst thing is that there is no real solution to the problem outside of government-controlled broadband access. There aren't enough people here to justify new equipment or more cellular installations and corporations aren't going to lose money so I have better internet and more choice. I get that.</p><p>If you don't live in the U.S. or Canada you might not understand the situation: most of the people live in a small area in and around metropolitan areas. That means there are vast areas of space without enough people for companies to worry about. My provider (I'm not naming them because it's not their fault in the end) really doesn't care if it loses me or one of the few hundred others who live in my small community. They care about the apartments and city blocks filled with people who will happily pay their monthly fees to have service. That's who they <em>should</em> care about because they have no incentive to care otherwise. This is a problem that probably will never be fixed.</p><p>I'm not a Capitalist, Communist, Democrat, or a Republican. I care about what's best for my family. I don't want to see more government involvement when it comes to basic utilities and I have a good idea of what a federal broadband provider would end up turning into. There is room for government oversight in many areas — including broadband access — but restricted, censored, state-sponsored internet isn't the answer. There really is no answer other than me paying someone to cut down a bunch of trees and put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">a satellite dish on my roof</a>. I checked into that, too. End of July if I want it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B" name="Starlink-lifestyle-lifestyle-16x9-01-08.jpg" alt="Starlink dishy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's starting to feel like I need to make a choice. I can stay here where the air is clean, the neighbors are friendly enough to leave each other alone, and the fishing is to die for. Or I can pack up and leave, heading somewhere where my technology-focused career is better nurtured. I wish I could say to hell with it all and go back to wiring houses like I did when I was 20. Life was a lot easier and the money was good enough to pay my way through school. That can't happen because construction sites are notoriously wheelchair-unfriendly. I'm not sure what to do at this point; spending the day sitting in my chair at a sticky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/mcdonalds-google-cloud-ask-pickles-partnership">McDonald's table</a> isn't my first choice though.</p><p>You <strong>can't</strong> do anything to help even if you want to help. I don't mean me and my situation, which will work itself out by the end of next week. But about the problem as a whole. But you do need to be aware of it and be a little skeptical the next time some agency or a company tells you how they're serving millions more people across rural America. The real problems are where there aren't millions of people in the first place, but there are enough people that need someone to give a damn.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The renders of the device show the wearable in a sleeker design, with white straps, a square-ish silver base, and its circular watch face on top. The Watch 8 is speculated to have only two physical buttons and come in two sizes.</p><p>Additionally, someone ended up uploading pictures of the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on eBay. In the listing, the smartwatch is seen with a leather strap, a circular (more squircle) design, with a prominent crown sitting between two buttons. The speakers are also seen on one side of the smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to show up with a steel or titanium finish.</p><hr><h2 id="the-week-of-outages-2">The week of outages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/theres-a-massive-chatgpt-outage-maybe-its-time-to-switch-over-to-gemini"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-spotify-amazon-and-more-hit-by-a-widespread-outage-impacting-thousands"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>This week saw outages on several online platforms, beginning with ChatGPT on June 10, where users experienced a massive 12-hour outage.

I’ll address the app in a bit.</p><p>The Liberty 5 are the successor to the Liberty 4 NC, but they do contain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-liberty-4-pro-review" target="_blank">elements of the Liberty 4 Pro</a>.

Slide the lid up, and you get a pairing button inside.</p><p>Below that, on the lip of the bottom half, you’ll find a light bar that indicates battery and connection status but is difficult to see outdoors, even in overcast sunlight. The case charges via USB-C and Qi wireless connections and has a matte finish that resists fingerprints very well, in contrast to the fingerprint magnet that is the Liberty 4 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-buds.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. out of their case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pop the earbuds out of the case, and you’ll find the same stem-style buds found in the previous generation, along with the clicky stem-based controls. In my couple of weeks with the earbuds, those controls took a bit of getting used to, but once I did, they were reliable and didn’t give me any false triggering issues when adjusting or readjusting them during exercise.</p><p>With the Liberty 5 earbuds, you’ll have five additional ear tips to choose from (shown in the gallery above). I used the default ear tips (mediums), which worked fine. Adjusting the seal of the right ear with the small gave me a better fit, so I stuck with that configuration for the remainder of my review period.</p><p>I appreciate that the white ear tips have a barely visible marking on them, indicating the size, so if you want to switch, you immediately know what you had in and which option you may want to try next.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.43%;"><img id="nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-device-setup" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Google setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="827" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-home" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-settings" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app, more settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-ldac" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app Sound Mode settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The app is highly customizable, featuring an 8-band EQ and 22 preset options, as well as the ability to create custom presets tailored to your hearing preferences.</p><p>There’s a gaming mode, the ability to switch between AAC and LDAC playback, and the option to adjust the strength of the ANC.

The 4 Pro presented a relatively balanced stereo image out of the box. The Liberty 5, on the other hand, are bass-heavy throughout most of the default sound profiles offered. If you’re a bass lover, this may not be bad, but it isn’t optimal and doesn’t present the full sonic image that the Liberty 5 can produce.</p><p>Overall, I’d characterize the default sound as having a very warm bottom in the upper bass with a lighter sub-bass punch.

Looking at the Developer Options menu on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, confirming that I was streaming “Trouble Man” and “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing,” using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">LDAC at 32bits/96kHz</a>, the experience was very satisfying.</p><p>Gaye’s arrangements are orchestral and expertly mastered, imparting a beautiful sense of space and nuanced instrumentation that is robust in its basslines and highs. His vocals and falsetto are top-tier, so much of that can get lost with a lesser pair of earbuds. Not the case with these. His vocals are bright and full of texture, as are Tammi Terrell’s, and the combination of their voices on that duet, presented through these earbuds, is immersive and highly entertaining.</p><p>Every other genre I threw at the Liberty 5 was well represented. The Liberty 5 proves to be a capable pair of relatively inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds that are sonically proficient with everything from speed metal to hip-hop to film scores and soundtracks.</p><p>Mic quality is clear, but on some calls, it sounded like I was in a closet. In one of my Discord chats, I left a nearly three-minute voice message for the group and listened to it back.

My go-to choice right now is the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, but I've been using Bose's QuietComfort Ultra for close to a month now, and they've been incredible.</p><p>The QuietComfort Ultra aren't affordable by any measure; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD">retail for $299 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earbuds-lunar-blue/6589910.p?skuId=6589910">Best Buy</a>, and that's $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56">more than the Sony WF-1000XM5</a> (which are on sale from their $299 retail). Annoyingly, Bose's earbuds miss out on niceties like wireless charging, which is available on most $100 models these days. The case is on the bulkier side as well, and while it is still pocketable, I don't get why it's so much bigger than most other products in this category.</p><p>Thankfully, that's about the only drawback I've had with the QuietComfort Ultra; these earbuds combine a great fit with a fabulous bass-heavy sound signature, and they easily connect to two devices at once. The best part is that with Snapdragon Sound integration, you can unlock higher-quality streams — if you've got a phone that also has the requisite codecs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I used the QuietComfort Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> as the phone comes with Snapdragon Sound as well, and it was a good pairing.

This appearance was likely for its rumored chip, which the leak claims is MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC. Strangely, the publication reports the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" with MediaTek's flagship chip.</p><p>The Geekbench listing reportedly states the S11 Ultra achieved a score of 5,312 in its multi-core test and 1,420 in the single-core run.</p><p>There were some smaller specs posted in the listing, like the existence of Android 16 and 12GB of RAM. Still no word on its internal storage; however, there's a chance Samsung could pop 256GB in it to match that 12GB of RAM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-look-2">An Ultra Look</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra leaks bring new information forward while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">also switching up the narrative</a> on a key specification: its SoC of choice. In a previous leak, the tablet was rumored to receive MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC from late last year. This chip was the company's flagship response to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. However, what this alleged Geekbench listing purports is the brand's updated (and upgraded) variant.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> offers a Big Core design with one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz. The company was adamant during its launch that this chip could "propel" users' experience with Android UX. What's more, the chip is paired with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU for "PC-like" graphical features on Android phones.</p><p>The SoC launched in April, and it seems Samsung could opt for this leveled-up version of MediaTek's flagship prowess.</p><p>Other Galaxy Tab S11 series rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">will drop the Plus model in 2025</a>, bringing back its base model, which was absent last year. While the base model could see a familiar 8,160mAh battery, the Ultra model might jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Speculation claims Samsung might hold onto its next flagship tablet series until after its summer Unpacked.

Google states this alternative overview is said to leverage the latest Gemini models for "quick, conversational" results for "certain" queries. Google remains confident that this feature (in testing) can help users understand information with convenience.</p><p>After searching, it seems Google's Audio Overviews in Search will appear as an option for users to receive. The post states testers will notice a "generate" button if the feature is available for that particular query.</p><p>If you opt into it, Audio Overviews will be housed in their own contained space within your results. Marked by a "Search Labs" experience label, the overview will inform users about what it entails. For example, users would see a "Listen to..." starter, followed by whatever the topic is you've searched for, like noise cancellation in headphones.</p><p>Following that is the Audio Overview itself, with a play button and how long Google's AI will be speaking about the subject. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">Search's regular AI Overviews</a>, users will see citations detailing where the model got its information. There will be a small label highlighting the number of websites, as well as a horizontal, scrollable carousel of those sites.</p><h2 id="merging-the-google-ai-experience-2">Merging the Google AI Experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.45%;"><img id="YuE9VG5ZLZD4QUnkcSKLie" name="google-search-audio-overviews-test" alt="Google's AI Search Labs brings "Audio Overviews" to users, which displays its own section with a clickable audio file for bite-sized information from Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuE9VG5ZLZD4QUnkcSKLie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="580" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since this is a Labs test, Google encourages users to offer feedback via its thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons. Additionally, if this interests you, users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">join the Search Labs experience</a> to begin trying it today (June 13).</p><p>Google's AI Overviews have continued to evolve; however, this alternative mirrors what was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">given through NotebookLM</a>. In September, Google rolled out Audio Overviews to NotebookLM, a journal-based app that lets users go in-depth with their research/learning for better understanding. For this app, Audio Overviews utilized two AI "co-hosts" for a conversational, podcast-like creation.</p><p>One primary difference here is that NotebookLM's version leverages information contained within <em>your </em>documents. The AI tries its best to condense this information in a way that facilitates better understanding. Additionally, users can guide these AI toward specific talking points and even pose questions.</p><p>Google's version in this Search test seems restricted to the AI delivering its best version of condensed information for the user. There's a chance the company could bring similar NotebookLM features to Search, but that remains speculative for now.</p> ]]></dc:content>
