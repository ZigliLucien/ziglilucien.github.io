<hr>
<p>It&apos;s rare to see one of the biggest tech companies in the world admit that it&apos;s facing a significant problem. Well, that&apos;s exactly what Samsung&apos;s vice chairman of Samsung Electronics&apos; DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun, did in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/고객과-투자자-그리고-임직원-여러분께-말씀드립니" target="_blank">press release</a> this week. Young-hyun acknowledged that outsiders are viewing the company&apos;s current situation as a "crisis" and vowed to make changes and improvements that will benefit investors, customers, and employees alike. </p><p>"To our customers, investors, and employees who have always loved Samsung Electronics, Today, we, the management of Samsung Electronics, would like to first apologize to you," the press release, translated to English, read.</p><p>"The performance that fell short of market expectations has raised concerns about the fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company. Many people are talking about Samsung’s crisis," the statement continued. "All of this responsibility lies with us who are leading the business."</p><p>The past two years haven&apos;t gone smoothly for the South Korean tech giant. First, financial results and earnings started to slip in 2023 after encouraging post-pandemic figures. The release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> didn&apos;t seem to markedly improve things, with Samsung losing market share to its competitors throughout 2024. </p><p>The turmoil also drew attention to Samsung in less-than-favorable ways. In April 2024, Samsung initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create "a sense of crisis" among the company&apos;s leadership team. </p><p>Following the criticism of new Galaxy wearables, which many viewed as Apple design knockoffs, it was reported that the Samung MX Division&apos;s chairman, Lee Jae-yong, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">was "angry" at the team&apos;s design</a>. Of course, this left us wondering why a Samsung chairman was only finding about the products&apos; designs <em>after</em> they released.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yns83BF2vPg2t3YXGbLVPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads us to now, when Young-hyun is publicly apologizing for the company&apos;s lack of innovation. </p><p>"Samsung has a history of challenge, innovation, and overcoming that has always turned crises into opportunities. We will definitely make the serious situation we are currently facing into an opportunity for a leap forward," the statement read. </p><p>"Above all, we will restore the fundamental competitiveness of technology. Technology and quality are our lifeblood," Young-hyun wrote. "It is Samsung Electronics’ pride that we can never compromise on. Rather than short-term solutions, we will secure fundamental competitiveness."</p><p>Despite Samsung&apos;s efforts in April 2024 to rectify things, the so-called "crisis" seems to be getting worse before it gets better. The newly-launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> sold less than 300,000 units in its first two weeks of availability, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1828779774673928473?" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, who has a solid track record. That&apos;s fewer units than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 sold last year, per the report, and seemingly continues Samsung&apos;s regression. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 is worse than Fold5... It seems that AI alone cannot save Samsung.Globally, only 270,000 units were sold in the first two weeks.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1828779774673928473">August 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Official estimations from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share" target="_blank">International Data Corporation (IDC)</a> confirm that Samsung has lost smartphone market share as of Q2 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. IDC reports that although Samsung moved over 53 million smartphone units in the second quarter, its market share dipped to 18.4 percent — down from 20 percent at the same point last year. Meanwhile, competitors Xiaomi and Vivo expanded their market share year-over-year. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, Samsung did ship more phones in Q2 2024 than anyone else. However, it might not be a coincidence that Xiaomi and Vivo — which are both pushing the boundaries of smartphone technology outside North America — are gaining on Samsung as it, by its own admissions, isn&apos;t innovating like it should be.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 screen on in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who has closely followed Samsung product launches and financial results for the past few years, it&apos;s not particularly surprising to me that sales are suffering. The company is releasing new devices, but they&apos;re not pushing the boundaries in a competitive smartphone market. </p><p>Take the standard Galaxy S24, which still packs the same camera system as the Galaxy S22. There&apos;s no reason we should be going three generations between camera upgrades. That&apos;s especially true while Apple and Google continue improving the camera systems on their base-model flagships. In all, the Galaxy S24&apos;s best feature was arguably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which made its way to the Galaxy S23 series eventually. </p><p>The worst offender is the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which shares the same rear main camera as the base Galaxy S24. That&apos;s despite the fact that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs over $1,000 more than the Galaxy S24 — and that it&apos;s really the same camera sensor as the nearly three-year-old Galaxy S22. I&apos;ve spent weeks with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a>, and it&apos;s Google&apos;s foldable that feels more innovative and exciting. There&apos;s no doubt about it. </p><p>It&apos;s hard to accept Samsung&apos;s apology as a reporter and reviewer that&apos;s closely followed the company&apos;s incremental updates for years, and watched brands like Pixel, OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Honor trounce Samsung in terms of innovation. With that being said, it takes courage to acknowledge the elephant in the room, especially if you&apos;re a company as large as Samsung. Here&apos;s to hoping things improve starting with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> next year.</p>

Earlier this year, there was an opportunity to this natural phenomenon, but I simply missed out. This time, I didn&apos;t miss out, and I was extremely lucky. </p><p>Last night, as dusk turned dark, I was scrolling through social media and saw a few posts explaining an ongoing solar storm. After the sun was down for the day, I went outside, hoping that I&apos;d be able to see it, but I came up short. Then, I remembered that it was possible to "see" the Aurora Borealis with the help of a camera, even if it was not visible to the naked eye. </p><p>So I grabbed my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, opened the camera, switched over to Night Sight, and pointed it at the sky. What I ended up with was a picture of the sky with what kinda looks like a paintbrush stroke of magenta. Needless to say, I got extremely excited, so I went to try and find a tripod to set up the Pro Fold. </p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography Mode</a> takes about four minutes, and while it&apos;s possible to just stand and hold the phone in your hand, the results might not be what you had hoped. </p><p>Plus, it&apos;s practically impossible to stand completely still for four minutes, at least for me. My eight-month-old son was also fast asleep, and I didn&apos;t want to take a chance to wake him up by rummaging through drawers trying to find something that would work. </p><p>Then it struck me. I don&apos;t need a tripod. The Fold <em>IS</em> the tripod. </p><p>Thankfully, my back patio has wooden railings, making it the perfect place to set up the 9 Pro Fold. After about a minute or so of trying to line things up to avoid my neighbors&apos; porch lights, I was ready to go. </p><p>After standing outside, being as still as I could, the 9 Pro Fold spit out the following image:</p><p> </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cfw4WHK6c8VuMC7yWgWw7H" name="northern-lights-on-pixel-9-pro-fold-shot-3.jpg" alt="Northern Lights captured by the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with Astrophotography Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cfw4WHK6c8VuMC7yWgWw7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first time in my 34 years, I can finally say that I&apos;ve seen the Northern Lights. Sure, I didn&apos;t see it with my own eyes, but I took the pictures, and it&apos;s something that I&apos;ll always remember. </p><p>All of which was made possible by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, removing the need to build a contraption that allows me to angle a phone at the right angle. Instead, just let the phone do the hard work for you, relying on the hinge to let you position the camera to capture as much of the sky as you want.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was my tool of choice, this time, it could technically be done with any foldable phone. This didn&apos;t do much to sway my opinion about how I wish Google would&apos;ve used the same cameras from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. </p><p>What it did do is reaffirm my adoration for foldable phones and the flexibility offered by the form factor. I&apos;ve long been a fan of this form factor, carrying one with me practically every day since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-2-security-updates-ended-october-2024">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>. After this experience, that will continue to be the case for as long as companies keep making them.</p><p>That was originally the end of this piece until I went to download and transfer the images to my computer. As luck would have it, I captured something besides just the Northern Lights. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Tribit continually delivers exciting Bluetooth speakers, and the manufacturer is particularly great at rolling out products that undercut its rivals by a sizeable margin. The StormBox Pro is proof of this, and if you need an outdoor speaker, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-stormbox-blast-is-my-new-favorite-bluetooth-speaker/1000">StormBox Blast</a> is still the best overall choice.</p><p>Tribit is now rolling out an update to the original StormBox, dubbed the StormBox 2. The speaker has better sound, increased battery life, Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, and the ability to connect to another unit, creating a stereo pair. What hasn&apos;t changed is the affordability — the StormBox 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">retails for $69 on Amazon</a>, and you can get it for $62 right now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qVDdJpZfrehYzoZ433sWvG" name="tribit-stormbox2-7.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 against a blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qVDdJpZfrehYzoZ433sWvG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The StormBox 2 has a cylinder profile, and the design looks great — you don&apos;t get the feeling that you&apos;re using a budget Bluetooth speaker at all. In fact, I like the design to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tribit-stormbox-flow-review">StormBox Flow</a>, and the plastic chassis with fabric cover makes it easier to use the speaker. It has tiny rubber feet at the bottom to ensure it stays planted, but most of the time, I used the StormBox 2 in a horizontal position.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D7AaBDxWiL3pLc499FhBdF" name="tribit-stormbox2-2.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 side view with Tribit logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D7AaBDxWiL3pLc499FhBdF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the design, you can slot in the StormBox 2 in your car&apos;s cup holder or water bottle holder on a bike, and thanks to IPX7 ingress protection, you don&apos;t have to worry about water ingress. I would like liked to see dust protection as well, but even without it, the speaker holds up incredibly well in outdoor use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ho55L2o8owmYr2voUL9VrF" name="tribit-stormbox2-3.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 side view showing Tribit logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ho55L2o8owmYr2voUL9VrF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It isn&apos;t just the design where the StormBox 2 excels either; the speaker has 360-degree sound thanks to dual 17W drivers, and it gets noticeably louder than the Flow even though it costs less. I used the Flow extensively at the start of the year, but after getting the StormBox 2, I just didn&apos;t feel the need to use the other speaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="XE2hC7BUt8zXkj3B9UUrCH" name="tribit-stormbox2-hero.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 showcasing design against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XE2hC7BUt8zXkj3B9UUrCH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the StormBox 2 is that it has chunky buttons; you get volume controls and a multi-function button at the front that has seek controls and the ability to play or pause music. The large buttons make it very convenient to use the StormBox 2, and Tribit did a great job in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BHnrATUUveXqEoas9JLX7G" name="tribit-stormbox2-4.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 back with Bluetooth and power buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHnrATUUveXqEoas9JLX7G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get another set of buttons at the back: power, Bluetooth, XBass mode, and stereo pair. The StormBox 2 has a 3.5mm in, and I used it to good effect to connect my Arturia MicroFreak synth. The charging port is at the bottom, and the 3.5mm jack and USB-C port are covered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PLXqBSJqBHoJCa2kmkWhcG" name="tribit-stormbox2-6.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 covered ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLXqBSJqBHoJCa2kmkWhcG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tribit touts 24 hours of battery life, but you won&apos;t get close to that in real-world use. With XBass enabled and volume set to around 70%, I managed to get over 20 hours of use between charges, and that&apos;s more than adequate. It manages to last longer than other sub-$100 Bluetooth speakers I used, and I have no issues in this regard.</p><p>The only problem is that the StormBox 2 charges at a glacial 5W, and as it includes a 5200mAh battery, you&apos;re looking at a charging time of just under four hours. There is no fast charging, and while that is irksome, you won&apos;t have to plug in the speaker a lot. In the three months I used it, I averaged charging it once a week.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o9USyGnftrhCtaFK86otTH" name="tribit-stormbox2-8.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox 2 with Pixel 9 Pro XL running Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9USyGnftrhCtaFK86otTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the StormBox 2 comes into its own is sound quality — it may just be the best-sounding sub-$100 speaker I used until now. You get a detailed bass with plenty of vibrancy, and there&apos;s good rumble and definition. The mids are clear and come across as natural, and the highs have good extension. There is noticeable sibilance when you crank up the volume, but this can be addressed by tweaking the EQ.</p><p>You can use the Tribit app to customize the sound profile by using the preset filters or adjusting the EQ to your tastes. And if you want even better sound, you can connect two StormBox 2 units to create a stereo pair. I don&apos;t have issues with the way Tribit tunes the sound of its products, and without adjusting the EQ in any way, the StormBox 2 sounds great in its own right.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with connectivity either; the StormBox 2 connected to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and a half-dozen other devices without any problem whatsoever, and it maintained a strong signal without any distortion.</p><p>Overall, it&apos;s easy to recommend the StormBox 2. If you need a portable Bluetooth speaker with great sound and water resistance, there really isn&apos;t anything better in the sub-$100 segment. Tribit once again managed to deliver a strong product, and as always, you get a stellar value — this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best Bluetooth speakers</a> in this category. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus Open is allegedly getting a sequel, expected to launch early next year between January and March 2025.</li><li>While specific camera details are still unclear, the OnePlus Open 2 is rumored to feature a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a periscope lens, and a third camera of unknown purpose.</li><li>The Open 2 might be the first foldable to feature the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus Open is getting a follow-up despite earlier rumors, and word on the street is that the next iteration might arrive early next year.</p><p>As per tipster @Rodent950, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> is expected to hit the market in the first quarter of next year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-open-2-oppo-find-n5-release-leak-3489359/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). That means we could see it launch sometime between January and March 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Find N5 and X8 Ultra are coming in Q1 N5 is tested with X8 Ultras quad camera setup, but seems that they're ditching it and continue with current tricam setup. #OppoFindN5 #OppoFindX8Ultra pic.twitter.com/jYvmaJ5PBM<a href="https://twitter.com/RODENT950/status/1843914486723510631">October 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the leaked info doesn’t mention the OnePlus Open 2 directly, it does hint at the OPPO Find N5. This device is expected to be rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2 for markets outside China.</p><p>For the uninitiated, OnePlus and OPPO are under one corporate roof, sharing tech innovations across their products. This partnership is what led to the original OnePlus Open being based on the Find N3. So, it makes sense that the upcoming Open model will be built on the Find N5.</p><p>The tipster also divulged that OPPO/OnePlus tried to include their quad camera setup, meant for the Find X8 Ultra, into the new foldable. Unfortunately, it seems that experiment didn’t quite work out, so they’ve decided to stick with a three-camera system for the Open 2/Find N5.</p><p>Although the exact camera specs for the upcoming foldable are still a bit of a mystery, the rumors point to a 50MP main sensor from Sony, along with a periscope lens and a third camera whose purpose remains unclear (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oppo-find-x8-ultra-n5-launch-timeline-tipped/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>).</p><p>Looking at the current OnePlus Open, it features a 48MP main sensor, a 64MP telephoto lens, and a 48MP ultrawide lens. In our review of the OnePlus Open, we praised its camera system for taking stunning photos and videos. So, if there’s no major upgrade in 2025, it’s not likely to be a big letdown.</p><p>Besides, adding four rear cameras would probably make the foldable bulkier, so keeping the camera setup more streamlined could actually be a smart move. There are also hints that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-thinner-design-rumors">OnePlus is working on making the Open 2 even thinner</a> to challenge the Honor Magic V3.</p><p>Furthermore, 91Mobile hints that the Find N5/Open 2 might be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to feature the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. This phone could come with a unique circular camera module, and a main display with a 2K resolution, just like its predecessor.</p>

The hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment as it doesn&apos;t have any 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports or M.2 SSD slots, but those are minor limitations that ultimately have a bearing in daily use.</p><p>That said, the rest of the hardware is terrific; the DS224+ is powered by the Intel Celeron J4125, and it is the default choice for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS servers</a>. It even has the ability to transcode Plex content, making it that much more enticing. So if you have a large media library and want to set up a NAS, you should pick up the DS224+. The 2-bay NAS has 2GB of RAM out of the box, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.</p><p>The biggest differentiator for the DS224+ is the software; the DiskStation Manager interface has a polished design and plenty of features, and best of all, it&apos;s easy to use. You can set up Synology Photos and have a Google Photos alternative that stores data in your own house, and the utility by itself makes the DS224+ worthy. In a similar vein, you can back up data from just about any device automatically, access your media library when you&apos;re away from your home, and a whole lot more.</p><p>Ultimately, the DS224+ has the requisite hardware and software to truly stand out, and it is an easy choice if you need a powerful home NAS server.</p>

This is also a 2-bay NAS, but it doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware; it is powered by a Realtek RTD1619B chip, has 1GB of memory, and a single Gigabit Ethernet port at the back.</p><p>The upside is that it costs under $200, and that makes it highly enticing. You still get most of the software features that are present in the DS224+, and while you miss out on containerization and virtual machines, those aren&apos;t features that make a difference to home users anyway.</p><p>While there are plenty of budget NAS servers, I always recommend the DS223j for the proven software. It is significantly easier to use, and Synology&apos;s mobile apps allow you to stream your media from anywhere in the world. And the best part is that it has a native Plex client, so you can set up a media server without any issues.</p><p>If you just need a NAS to store data in a single location and stream media on a budget, the DS223j is the best choice available today.</p>

<p>You need a reliable way to store photos and valuable data, but don&apos;t want to invest in a full-fledged NAS. That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-beestation-4tb-review">BeeStation</a> comes in; this is an all-in-one unit that houses a 4TB hard drive (a HAT3300 Plus), so you can get started straight away. The goal with the BeeStation is to target consumers that don&apos;t yet have a NAS and are looking to get affordable local storage that&apos;s connected to the network.</p><p>Therefore, you don&apos;t get a lot of software features; there&apos;s the ability to back up photos and videos, and files from any of your connected machines. That&apos;s it. You don&apos;t get the usual DiskStation Manager software, and the interface is as barebones as it can get. That said, the BeePhotos mobile client makes it easy to back up photos and videos, and in the four months that I used the BeeStation, it has proven to be reliable.</p><p>The biggest limitation is the lack of media streaming. You can store your media library on the device, but you can&apos;t do much with it. The BeeStation is instead designed as a private cloud solution; instead of storing photos and documents on Google Drive and other public cloud providers, the idea is that you back it up to this device.</p><p>To that effect, the BeeStation integrates with Google Drive and other storage providers, and you can transfer the data from those services to the BeeStation easily. So if you need an easy way to back up photos and videos and don&apos;t need many additional features, the BeeStation is a good choice.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR is doing all the right things with its home NAS servers, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">AS5402T</a> is a testament to how far the brand has come in the last two years. The 2-bay NAS has the best hardware package in this category; it is powered by Intel&apos;s Celeron J5105, has 4GB of RAM with the ability to upgrade to 16GB, four M.2 slots in total, two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports.</p><p>There&apos;s also an HDMI port at the back that lets you connect the AS5402T to a TV, and the Intel hardware makes the NAS a standout choice if you need a powerful Plex server. It easily handles transcodes and playback without any issues, and in my testing, it did a better job than just about any other 2-bay NAS.</p><p>But it&apos;s the connectivity that allows it to stand out; with two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, the AS5402T is future-proof, and you don&apos;t need to switch to another NAS when you upgrade your home network. ASUSTOR&apos;s software still isn&apos;t as polished or easy to use, but it has gotten better over the last two years, and it comes with much better security this time around.</p>

I prefer it to the DiskStation DS923+ as it comes with the ability to handle Plex transcodes, and that is its biggest advantage.

The result is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">F8 SSD Plus</a>, an SSD-only NAS that is the best you can get today. The NAS isn&apos;t as wide as a regular 2-bay unit, but you get the ability to slot a total of eight M.2 SSDs — four on each side — making it a fantastic choice if you&apos;re ready to switch to fast SSD storage. </p><p>It is powered by Intel&apos;s i3 N305 and comes with 16GB of DDR5 memory, and it is one of the fastest NAS models I used this year. You get 10GbE connectivity as standard, and while there isn&apos;t Thunderbolt 4, the USB-C port allows a lot of extensibility down the line. </p><p>The software is much better than previous years as well, with TOS 6 providing a polished interface with plenty of useful features. There&apos;s a native Plex client, container management, and a host of utilities to back up data. </p><p>SSDs are affordable enough that you can legitimately build a NAS with only M.2 storage, and if you&apos;re interested in going that route, you need to get the F8 SSD Plus. </p>

<p>As a NAS server is designed to run 24/7, you can&apos;t use a standard hard drive. Thankfully, there are drives designed just for NAS use, and I&apos;ve rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best hard drives for NAS</a> in a standalone article. </p><p>At a high-level overview, you&apos;ll need to buy either Seagate&apos;s IronWolf or IronWolf Pro series or Western Digital&apos;s Red Plus or Red Pro hard drives. I&apos;ve used all of these drives for nearly a decade now, and they&apos;ve proven to be reliable. </p><p>If I had to suggest a drive for home use, it would be the Seagate IronWolf. I have over 50TB of IronWolf drives in various servers, and it is hands-down the most reliable NAS drive that I have used. It starts off at 2TB and goes up to 18TB, and for home use, anything over 4TB should be an ideal choice. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Docs is rolling out document tabs to let you break information in large documents into tidy sections for easy navigation.</li><li>To use tabs, just click the bullet-point button in the upper left corner and select "Show tabs" to start adding and managing them.</li><li>You can also create subtabs for deeper organization, diving into specific tasks or topics within your main tabs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Docs is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/tabs-in-google-docs.html" target="_blank">rolling out</a> a handy new feature that will simplify how you organize and access information in large documents, making navigation smoother than ever.</p><p>While using headings and the document outline is great for separating different sections, the new document tabs take things to the next level. They let you slice up info into neat sections, making it super easy to find your way around long texts. Tabs also speed up how you find what you need, turning the hassle of heavy documents into a smooth ride.</p><p>This feature will make it clear what a document is all about, helping writers, editors, and readers quickly grasp its structure, highlight key points, and locate specific sections easily.</p><p>To use the tabs feature in Docs on the web, just find the bullet-point button in the upper left corner of your document. When you hover over it, a tooltip will pop up saying "Show tabs." Clicking on the button will let you add and manage multiple tabs.</p><p>Every document starts with Tab 1, but you can add as many tabs as you want. To keep things clear and organized, you can rename these tabs from their default labels to something that actually makes sense by clicking the three-dot menu. Plus, you can rearrange tabs with a simple drag-and-drop.</p><p>To make it even easier to spot your tabs, you can add emojis to them. These emojis will show up to the left of the tab title in the left panel, taking the place of the default tab icon.</p><p>For even better organization, you can break tabs down into subtabs. This lets you dive into specific tasks or topics within a bigger picture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z3qpP5MfznPf9Ap7a74KF4" name="Google-Docs-tabs.gif" alt="Google Docs document tabs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3qpP5MfznPf9Ap7a74KF4.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature lets you create up to three levels of nested subtabs. You can add these subtabs in two ways: either by choosing &apos;Add subtab&apos; from the tab options menu or by simply dragging one tab onto another, which will turn it into a subtab. Just like with the main tabs, you can label each subtab and add emojis for quick recognition.</p><p>The tab navigation menu pops up automatically when your document has two or more tabs. You can easily share links to specific tabs by clicking the three-dot menu next to each one. Plus, if you want to copy a tab, just use the &apos;Duplicate&apos; option in that same menu.</p><p>First <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-generative-ai-and-security-innovations" target="_blank">revealed in April of this year</a>, the tabs feature is now rolling out gradually to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> users, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and those with personal Google accounts.</p>

<hr>
<p>Here&apos;s a surprising duo you never knew was coming: Amazon&apos;s Prime and Apple TV Plus.</p><p>Amazon announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription">Newsroom post</a> that it will "soon" bring an Apple TV add-on to its Prime Video streaming service. The Senior Vice President and Head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, Mike Hopkins said in a statement, "... we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video."</p><p>Hopkins also stated the inclusion of an Apple TV Plus add-on would give users a more "personalized" streaming experience with additional options.</p><p>The company highlighted shows like The Morning Show, Palm Royale, Shrinking, and Hijack. Additionally, it stated a host of Apple Original films joined the fray, including the movie CODA.</p><p>Sports lovers who already have Prime Video for the NFL&apos;s Thursday Night Football broadcasts can grab games from Apple TV Plus&apos; MLS Season Pass. The MLB is featured on the streaming service every Friday for its "Friday Night Baseball" featurette. This brings a double-header to subscribers every Friday.</p><p>Prime Video subscribers in the U.S. can grab the Apple TV Plus add-on for an extra $9.99 monthly. The subscription will roll out "later this month," letting users watch extra content across multiple devices. Moreover, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-tv-plus-on-prime-video/?taid=6707c1e4d047f5000143f685&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a> noted, Amazon&apos;s Apple TV Plus add-on helps relieve stress for Android. The streaming service didn&apos;t previously have any "native" support on Android, but this will rectify that in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>You may not remember, but Android TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tv-getting-apple-tv-app">launched an Apple TV app</a> back in 2020. Content is also available through Google TV; however, both avenues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tvplus/smart-tvs-and-streaming-devices-apda10aaed81/web">lack total support</a> as the app doesn&apos;t offer "purchases within the app." With the streaming service arriving soon on Prime Video, users will likely find a much smoother experience with the choice.</p><p>In July, Amazon announced the rollout of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-ui-content-changes">Prime Video UI redesign</a>. It came with a navigation bar full of pre-made options like "Prime," packed with content at no extra charge. Similarly, the bar features a section for add-on content. All subscription services tacked onto your already recurring Prime Video membership will appear beside the "Prime" icon.</p><p>Apple TV Plus will likely fall into this category if purchased. Additionally, scrolling over an add-on&apos;s icon will display what you were watching as its hero image. Amazon stated generative AI found its way into the redesign to give users "relevant content" if they&apos;re stuck on what to watch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s monthly security update is starting to hit its flagship series.</p><p>Users on the Galaxy S24 Ultra subreddit have reported the beginning of the October 2024 security update rollout. More specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1fzwhyh/october_security_patch_time_att_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user states</a> the update has reached the AT&T U.S. version of the latest Ultra model (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-october-2024-security-patch/?taid=6707a5a7d047f5000143f1a2&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>). It seems that all three devices are receiving this as the provided changelog snapshot shows three version numbers ending with "<strong>AXI1</strong>."</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1g0cbsr/tmobile_us_october_update_rolling_out/">users reported</a> the update has hit T-Mobile devices in the U.S. and Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s in the EU.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s patch notes shown on devices are quite light with the company only highlighting "improved security." However, the download arrives as a 442.22MB payload, pointing us toward Samsung&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">updates board</a>.</p><p>The company lists two "Critical" fixes in October and 28 "High-level" corrections. Alongside a Samsung Semiconductor fix, the security patch includes a crucial fix for Knox Guard. Samsung states the fix should eliminate the possibility for "physical" hackers to bypass the security feature&apos;s defenses.</p><p>Several more fixes were included that solved "improper" access to the ActivityManager and more for "out-of-bounds" issues that plagued Android 12 to 14 devices.</p><p>On Google&apos;s side, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-10-01">Security Bulletin</a> states it provided three Framework fixes and four System fixes.</p>

<p>The update has started making its rounds today (Oct 10), meaning users may see it as the week closes.

While rumors suggest Google will launch the major update in October, Samsung says Galaxy lovers will have to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">wait until 2025</a>. The Korean OEM showcased its design overhaul planned for One UI 7 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">during SDC 2024</a> on a Galaxy S24 Ultra. Samsung plans to separate the notification panel and the Quick Settings menu in One UI 7.</p><p>Additionally, the entire rework seems more Apple-like as the Quick Settings takes on a curvier, rounded appearance with added customization.</p><p>It&apos;s not all bad as a Samsung moderator states users might see a Public Beta program begin later this year. It was mentioned in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-plans-one-ui-7-public-beta">a community forum post</a> asking about the subject as Samsung only mentioned developers during SDC. However, we&apos;re still waiting for "confirmation" on the schedule before we see the Public Beta begin.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra redefines what it means to have a slab phone on hand. The device drops its curved display for a completely flat experience embedded in a titanium frame with anti-glare technology. So, with 6.8 inches of prime real-estate, everything from scrolling to watching videos is immersive and fun.</p></p>

Purchase the Galaxy S24 Ultra directly from the source and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928uzkfxaa"><strong>you'll get a straight discount of up to $300 off</strong></a> (depending on the storage configuration), no strings attached and no trade-in required. That discount alone matches the expired Prime Day deal on the S24 Ultra, but it gets even better..</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><em><strong>See all the deals from Samsung's anti-Prime Day sale</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>For one, if you <em>do </em>have a device to trade in, Samsung is offering up to $750 off the S24 Ultra, plus you can get 30% dropped off the price of a Galaxy Watch 7 or Watch Ultra when you bundle the device with your new phone. As if those savings weren't enough, Samsung will also give you over $200 worth of free Adobe subscriptions and streaming trials. Not too shabby for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that Samsung has ever produced.</p>

There's also $750 of trade-in credit up for grabs and a free $100 Samsung credit if you activate through your carrier. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928uzkfxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9cf20d24-82d4-455e-8830-f2768c75f3c2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy S24 Ultra" data-dimension48="Galaxy S24 Ultra" data-dimension25="$1119.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Samsung deals</a> are typically pretty complicated, so it's nice to see such a straightforward discount on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Another perk to buying the super-powered smartphone directly from Samsung is that you'll get access to a few color options not available anywhere else, such as Titanium Orange.</p><p>No matter which color you choose, you're getting a device that we called the "best Android phone in the US", with all of the sophisticated design, power, and innovative features that you could ever want in a flagship. You even get seven years of OS and security updates guaranteed, which means this could be your daily driver device for a good long while.</p><p>Indeed, the only real beef I've ever had with the Galaxy S24 Ultra is its price, but thanks to this leftover Prime Day, that's no longer such an issue.</p>

<p>Back in 1997, my Windows 95-era PC was graced with the honor of playing Bullfrog&apos;s classic strategy game, Dungeon Keeper, a game that would quickly become one of my favorite strategy titles of all time. While the 1999 sequel was bigger and badder, EA would later close Bullfrog Productions, erasing my hopes for a new Dungeon Keeper entry in the future.</p><p>Thankfully, there are other people like me, and that&apos;s how Underworld Overseer was born. Deisim developer Myron Games is one of them and has crafted a real gem of a Dungeon Keeper spiritual successor with Underworld Overseer for the Meta Quest platform — one that would be perfect for your shiny new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> when the game releases this Halloween.</p><p>Like Dungeon Keeper, you&apos;ll be building and maintaining a dungeon designed to attract underworld creatures of all sorts. From goblins to trolls, dark wizards, and imps, your job is to make the best dungeon possible for them to live in.</p><p>Of course, humans don&apos;t care much for these sorts of creatures and will regularly invade your dungeons in an effort to stamp out all forms of what they deem evil life and it&apos;s up to you to manage things in a way that keeps your denizens safe and prosperous, all with the power of your Meta Quest headset.</p>

<p>The moment I fired up the first early demo back in June, I was blown away by the visual quality of Underworld Overseer. To say this is the sharpest Meta Quest 3 game I&apos;ve ever played is no exaggeration. Units come to life in crisp detail that&apos;ll blow your mind when you see them up close, something that&apos;s particularly potent in VR when you can use your hands to pick up any unit and inspect it.</p><p>Not only that, but Underworld Overseer builds upon Myron&apos;s experience with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/deisim-for-oculus-quest-filled-the-void-in-my-heart-that-black-and-white-left" target="_blank">Deisim</a>, another excellent VR strategy title that feels a little bit like the PC classics Civilization and Black & White, albeit without the giant virtual pet roaming the lands.</p><p>Each of the game&apos;s 18 levels follows the same general gameplay loop. You&apos;ll start with a dungeon heart and a few imps. From here, you&apos;ll mark places for the imps to dig, carving out spaces for rooms and tunnels as you make your way through each of the hand-crafted areas. Some blocks store gold and riches that will be used to pay your dungeon&apos;s denizens — hey, they have to work for a living, too — while other treasures await discovery deeper in.</p>

<p>Underworld Overseer&apos;s controls are simple to understand with little to no learning curve, especially if you&apos;ve played any other VR strategy games. You can grab the world at any time with the grip buttons on the controller and move around, as well as use both hands to "pinch and zoom" with an inward or outward motion for better micromanagement. This comes in handy, particularly in the larger maps when you need to move around a lot to micromanage units, helping to bring in specialist combat units to deal with human intruders or move imps around for faster construction.</p><p>As you might expect from a VR strategy title, you can grab any unit in your dungeon for any reason. If any one unit is making you mad, it&apos;s easy to permanently dispose of them by picking them up and flinging them out of existence. Most of the time, though, you&apos;ll be using the grab tactic to move units around your dungeon for manual management, even though unit AI is quite smart. Units can only move so fast on their own, so being the godly figure you are, it makes a lot of sense to aid them with some micromanagement.</p>

<p>When you&apos;re not picking up units and moving them around the map, you&apos;ll be marking new areas for construction, moving gold around your storehouses, and digging deep to find treasures galore hidden in the depths of each map.</p><p>The game will take you around 12 hours to fully complete, but there&apos;s always the possibility that things may take longer depending on how much of a completionist you are. Plus, playing the game on both difficulty levels presents unique challenges as the hard mode essentially requires you to micromanage units, as battles are simply too difficult to allow units to move at their own pace.</p><p>There&apos;s even a speed run achievement for players willing to "think outside the box," as Myron puts it, which helps put the power of VR interaction to full use.</p>

<p>Some strategy games I&apos;ve played on the Quest do a good job of translating flat-screen mechanics to the VR medium, but Underworld Overseer feels like an entirely different breed of made-for-VR strategy. What&apos;s impressive is that it does this while still evoking the powerful sense of nostalgia that comes with classic PC strategy games, all without feeling too complicated or shoed-in to somehow feel doable in VR.</p><p>What&apos;s more is that the game is constantly exciting and I rarely ever found myself standing (or sitting) there just starting at my dungeon without something to do. This keeps the pacing right on point, something that can be painful to deal with in VR if a game is too slow.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of strategy games, I&apos;d highly recommend preordering Underworld Overseer on the Meta Horizon Store right now. You&apos;ll get a nice discount for preordering and be ready to dive in when it&apos;s scheduled to release later this month.</p>
