Currently, rumors and leaks point to the Pixel 10 keeping a few things from the Pixel 9 while adding major upgrades. If you're in the market for a new Android phone, you might be wondering how the upcoming Pixel 10 is expected to compare to the current model.</p><p>Based on Google's new release schedule for Pixels, we'll likely see the Pixel 10 sometime in August 2025. That's about a month away, and leaks are intensifying as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">possible launch dates</a> get closer. Here's everything we know so far about how the Pixel 10 will improve upon the successful Pixel 9.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 9: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is expected to retain a similar design to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, perhaps with a larger camera bump and slightly different dimensions. Leaked renders reveal the existence of a pink colorway for the Pixel 10 that's more muted than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-should-you-buy">Peony option available on the Pixel 9</a>. Otherwise, the Pixel 10 appears to keep the same build as the Pixel 9, with flat aluminum side rails featuring chamfered edges and a glass back.</p><p>Exact dimensions for the Pixel 10 aren't available, but the Pixel 9 measures 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm and weighs 198 grams. The new model will likely keep similar dimensions, although not identical, which eliminates the chance of cross-generation case compatibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to see the Pixel 10 cut some weight to compete with flagships from Apple and Samsung, it's unclear whether Google will go that route. The rumored larger camera bump and telephoto lens could make the phone heavier, not lighter.</p><p>A hint that the Pixel 10 will have tweaked dimensions came by way of Thinborne, which listed Pixel 10 cases early. They've already arrived, and indeed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">a Pixel 9 won't fit right in a Pixel 10 case</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-18.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 on a plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the similar material choices, we expect both the Pixel 10 and Pixel 9 to offer Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and IP68 certification against dust and water ingress. At a minimum, the Pixel 10 display should match the Pixel 9's display specifications. That means you'll get a 6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED with a 2424 x 1080 resolution. We should also see HDR support and a peak brightness rating of at least 2,700 nits.</p><p>To differentiate the Pixel 10 display from that of the Pixel 9, Google could make a tweak or two. While the "Pro" models are expected to gain higher PWM capabilities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-display-leak-pwm-dimming-rate">the base-model Pixel 10 is rumored to miss out</a> on this functionality.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 9: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-20.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to feature the Tensor G5 as its processor, which isn't exactly surprising. Each generation of Pixel phones has received a new Tensor chip since Google made the switch to its own silicon designs. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-reportedly-closed-a-multi-year-deal-with-tsmc-starting-with-the-pixel-10">the Tensor G5 is reportedly the first chip to be made by TSMC</a> instead of Samsung Foundry, which could be a major leap.</p><p>Aside from gaining access to TSMC's advanced fabrication processes, Google may also have the opportunity to include more custom components in the Pixel 10. It will supposedly add a fully-custom image-signal processor (ISP) for the first time, for example. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">leaked parts list for the Tensor G5 serves as a preview</a> of what kind of upgrades might arrive on the Pixel 10.</p><p>Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">the Tensor G4 is widely considered to be a disappointment</a> compared to the Apple A18 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, this could be crucial for the Pixel 10 to remain competitive. The Pixel 9 and its Tensor G4 system-on-a-chip excel at AI tasks, but fall short in raw performance.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14, seven software updates (upgradeable to Android 16)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2, 4nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7, 25mm (wide), 1/2.0-inch, 0.8µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.68 1/1.31-inch module, 82-degree FoV, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>10.8 MP, f/3.1, 112mm (telephoto), 1/3.2-inch, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/1.7 1/2.55-inch module, wide-angle, 123-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f2.2, autofocus, 95-degree FoV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh battery,</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm, 198g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pink, other colors unknown </p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, Peony</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Otherwise, the Pixel 10 is expected to keep the exact same RAM and storage options as the Pixel 9. In that case, both phones would have 12GB of memory and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Higher capacities would be reserved for the more expensive Pixel 10 models, unless Google decides to make a change.</p><p>The Pixel 10 may also feature top-of-the-line connectivity support, including 5G and Wi-Fi 7, just like its predecessor. The Pixel 9 only had Bluetooth 5.3 support, so it'll be interesting to see whether the Pixel 10 sports a newer spec. In terms of biometrics, we expect to see an under-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.</p><p>The only other rumored hardware change is a bump to battery capacity, which is said to be 4,970mAh on the Pixel 10. That's up from 4,700mAh on the current Pixel 9.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9-cameras-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 9: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="w7a4n2raZJiYfYBubQ3fcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w7a4n2raZJiYfYBubQ3fcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's base-model Pixel phones haven't offered a telephoto lens for optical zoom in the past, but that might be changing with the Pixel 10. The phone is rumored to add a 10.8MP telephoto camera offering up to 5x optical zoom for the first time. This would reportedly be in addition to a 12MP ultrawide and a primary camera, bringing a triple-camera system to the smartphone.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the Pixel 10's primary camera will be a 48 MP f/1.7 sensor, likely similar to or identical to the cameras found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. While this could be seen as a downgrade compared to the Pixel 9's 50MP main camera, there could be more to the story. The Pixel 9a's "downgraded" primary camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">actually resulted in better photos overall than its predecessor</a>.</p><p>The current Pixel 9 features two rear cameras: a 50MP main sensor and a 48MP ultrawide sensor.

Usually, this is the time in a company's life cycle when it starts to play it safe, but the Nothing Headphone 1 do anything but. These headphones double down on what people love about Nothing, offering a unique design, competitive feature set, and an enticing value proposition.</p><p>At just $300, Nothing's Headphone 1 undercuts the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">premium over-ears</a> such as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM6. Surprisingly, the Headphone 1 holds its own compared to those competitors. The experience feels decidedly premium, and comfort is top-notch.</p><p>Audiophiles will nitpick the headphones' sound signature a bit, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/the-nothing-headphone-1-wants-to-make-noise-in-more-ways-than-one">Nothing Headphone 1</a> is a compelling package anyway. It does enough things really well at an attractive price point to make you consider buying them, even if you don't have a Nothing phone already.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-price-and-availability"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="usDaovFM3YcWC3Y67EuEH3" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-3" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1 case opened up, revealing the headphones and included cables." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usDaovFM3YcWC3Y67EuEH3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing officially revealed the Headphone 1 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Muen4f4L_6M?si=oTNGLIRma6SMIZ2s" target="_blank">YouTube livestream</a> on July 1, 2025, and pre-orders open globally as of July 4, 2025. The headphones retail for $299 in the U.S., £299 in the U.K., and €299 elsewhere in Europe. They're available in black and white, and both colorways feature a transparent window giving a sneak peek at what's inside.</p><p>Nothing Headphone 1 was made in partnership with KEF, a renowned audio brand, to give the headphones a custom sound. They will be available for purchase starting July 15, 2025, and that's when pre-orders will ship.

At first glance, Headphone 1 looks somewhat like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> lookalike. That impression fades away quick, and soon you realize it looks like if you took a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> and turned it into a pair of headphones.</p><p>Personally, I think Headphone 1 looks cool. The rectangular shape of the headphone chassis, made out of aluminum, feels premium. Then, the oval-shaped plastic window sits atop it to provide a little bit of flair. The translucency is a bit of a gimmick, as you can't really see much inside, but it's still a neat addition that matches nicely with other Nothing products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-11" alt="Wearing the Nothing Headphone 1 while holding up the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing's Headphone 1 fits right in if you have one of the company's phones. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the loud design language, Nothing Headphone 1 is fairly compact. The ear cups and main chassis are only 78mm thick combined, and most of that are the polyurethane foam-filled ear cushions. They weigh 329 grams, which is less than the gargantuan AirPods Max but more than most other over-ear competitors.</p><p>Still, I think I underestimated the Headphone 1's thin plastic headband. While looking a bit cheap compared to the aluminum housing, the adjustable and telescoping headband gets the job done. Nothing's Headphone 1 is right up there with some of my favorite headphones for comfort, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/these-sonos-headphones-arent-perfect-heres-why-i-still-recommend-them">including the Sonos Ace</a>.</p><p>I could wear Headphone 1 for hours-long listening sessions with no discomfort, and found a good fit within seconds of putting them on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-5" alt="A tilted view of the Nothing Headphone 1 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TjPPnqVvhUA29K6WmDzrDo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Headphone 1's design isn't the only thing unique about this pair of headphones. The sound signature and audio experience is different, too. At the heart of things is a custom 40mm dynamic driver surrounded by 8.9mm of polyurethane to minimize distortion. It features custom tuning in partnership with KEF, and Nothing says Headphone 1 "presents a sound profile that reproduces music as the artist intended."</p><p>After listening to hours of music with Headphone 1, I'd say they sound generally good, but I'm not sure the above description is accurate. Nothing's Headphone 1 are tuned to prioritize the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Compared to something with a flatter frequency distribution — I often use Audio Technica's ATH-M50X's for reference — Headphone 1 certainly adds its own unique flavor.</p><p>In my experience, the Nothing Headphone 1 will sound great about 90% of the time. However, you're likely to run into a few tracks that just sound off because the vocals or high-end sounds are muddied by an overreaching bass. If one of these songs just happens to be one you listen to a lot, the difference in sound might be obvious. Most of the time, you're going to get a very full sound out of the Nothing Headphone 1.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-X-app" alt="Setting up and changing the settings for the Nothing Headphone 1 in the Nothing X app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edLhseRVCoLqKPhENoJoUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason why this isn't too big of a deal is that Nothing is very transparent about Headphone 1's sound signature, for the most part. You can see this prioritization of lows and mids in the visual range for the <strong>Balanced</strong> EQ mode in the Nothing X companion app.</p><p>If you don't like it, you can easily adjust it. I found myself switching to the <strong>More treble</strong> EQ preset if I knew I was actively listening to genres like folk, alternative, or jazz, and that addressed some of my concerns. The headphones' spatial audio modes help add separation to the soundstage, too, and the head tracking is effective. I don't always like listening to music in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a>, but in this case, it added the clarity to things such as vocals or cymbals I was craving.</p><p>The level of control you get over Headphone 1, both in the app and on-device, is what makes the headphones great. For instance, you can choose between having active noise-cancelation or transparency mode on or off, but you can also adjust the strength of the ANC. This is handy, and I prefer it to how other headphones handle ANC modes, as it can be hard to tell when they're on or off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-8" alt="The roller and paddle on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjqrgvMZRHjG45fKorx6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of on-device controls, it's impossible not to mention everything the Nothing Headphone 1 offers. You get a paddle for playback control and a roller for volume, play/pause function, and ANC modes. There's also another button for voice assistant control and a dedicated Bluetooth pairing button. Oh, and Headphone 1 has its own on/off switch too.</p><p>I'd reconfigure the controls slightly, setting the voice assistant button to cycle through ANC modes instead. Otherwise, they're incredibly helpful, and way better than capacitive touch controls or a clunky button with too many functions. Paired with a USB-C port and 3.5mm jack, Headphone 1 goes old-school with hardware controls and ports, and I love it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-what-s-not-good"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-10" alt="The ear cushions on the Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tb4miSRtuJJFcPhKBiHXc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review"><strong>Nothing Ear Open</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing got a lot right with the Headphone 1, but I would've liked to see the pair handle a wider variety of songs more consistently. As I alluded to earlier, Headphone 1's sound tuning doesn't favor every kind of track. When you run into that one song that doesn't sound quite right, it might bug you. By comparison, something like the Sonos Ace can handle more songs without you needing to break into the Nothing X app equalizer.</p><p>Another part of the Headphone 1 experience that is <em>mostly</em> good are the buttons. It's great that they are here, but the paddle in particular could be easier to use. By default, the paddle can be flicked left or right to restart a song or change tracks. You're supposed to double-flick the paddle to go to the previous song, but need to take an awkward pause to do it. If you try to flick the paddle too quickly, it simply won't do anything.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2F6PhNmyX2TfUKi8zm9mj" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-9" alt="A side view of the Nothing Headphone 1 hanging from a chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2F6PhNmyX2TfUKi8zm9mj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the Headphone 1's battery life is excellent, lasting up to 35 hours with ANC on and up to 80 with it off. I just wish the 3.5mm jack would work as a fallback when the battery runs out, which it doesn't. You still need the battery to have juice in order to use the analog ports, and to me that slightly limits their utility.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-competition"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNwtqaodMDoB4siVuiU5u" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-2" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNwtqaodMDoB4siVuiU5u.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Nothing Headphone 1 case bears a striking resemblance to that of the Sonos Ace. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's important to remember that many of the over-ear headphones I'd take over the Nothing Headphone 1 cost much more. The Sonos Ace, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> all cost around $450 — that's $150 more than the Headphone 1 retails for.</p><p>Rather, the Nothing Headphone 1 competes more directly with a pair of over-ears like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/beats-studio-pro-launch">Beats Studio Pro</a>. They retail for $350 and are frequently on sale, and I've used them for months. Nothing's over-ears blow the Studio Pro out of the water, as Beats' offering is made out of cheap plastic and has a mediocre sound. So, when you consider the Headphone 1's price point, it's easier to look past some of its flaws.</p><p>You might be able to snag an older pair of Sony or Bose headphones for around the same price as the Headphone 1. You could certainly find a pair of wired headphones for less than the Nothing Headphone 1 that sound better. But if we're talking about new, wireless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">over-ear headphones with ANC</a>, the Nothing Headphone 1 fit the $300 price point very well.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-headphone-1-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing Headphone 1: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PCKLr2iDP9tjT3vFRCtQS" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-6" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1 hanging off a pole." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PCKLr2iDP9tjT3vFRCtQS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You like Nothing's eccentric design language</li><li>You want a pair of wireless, over-ear headphones with ANC</li><li>You have around $300 to spend and prioritize a premium build</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a pair of headphones with a more balanced soundstage</li><li>You feel overwhelmed by the amount of buttons</li><li>You don't like the loud design</li></ul><p>Nothing products aren't for everyone, but Headphone 1 might be the brand's most appealing product for the masses yet.

But an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.syss.com/posts/bluetooth-analysis-coros-pace-3/">IT exposé from SySS GmbH</a> has revealed a major security vulnerability, and COROS has been slow to acknowledge and address it.</p><p>According to the report, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> does not properly authenticate or encrypt the Bluetooth connection between your watch and phone, bypassing the "Secure Connections" tool introduced in Bluetooth 4.2 for a simpler connection.</p><p>A hijacker can exploit this vulnerability and force-pair to your watch if it becomes disconnected from your phone at any time, letting them perform these actions:</p><ul><li>"Hijacking the vicitim’s COROS account and accessing all data</li><li>Eavesdropping sensitive data, e.g. notifications</li><li>Manipulating the device configuration</li><li>Factory resetting the device</li><li>Crashing the device</li><li>Interrupting a running activity and forcing the recorded data to be lost"</li></ul><p>Your COROS account could show info like where you typically start your runs, as well as login details. But the notification access seems particularly frightening, as they can "eavesdrop" on <strong>every</strong> notification your connected phone receives. They can even "inject" fake notifications onto your watch using a Python script.</p><p>The attacker could also go to a race event and factory-reset every COROS watch in the area remotely, without the victims being able to determine who is doing it.</p><p>Interestingly, the SySS GmbH report notes that hijackers' access is easier with connected Android phones. iOS encrypts the Bluetooth connection at the system level, but with Android, the watch skips the "AuthReq" step and simply pairs, so the connection is "neither encrypted nor authenticated" by default.</p><p>All a hijacker needs to do is "wait for an Android phone with the COROS app installed to come into Bluetooth range." After that, "any ongoing BLE connection between an Android phone and the watch can be intercepted, sniffed, or tampered with, making attacks far more practical and harder to detect."</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>A COROS rep shared the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/38933102526996-Bluetooth-Security-Vulnerability-Statement">Bluetooth Security Vulnerability Statement</a>, which clarifies that this hacking attempt will need to be within "30 feet" and that Android users should force-quit the COROS app when not in use, which "prevents notifications from being passed to the watch in rare attack scenarios." They also recommend you set up a new COROS device "in a non-public setting."</p><h2 id="how-coros-is-addressing-the-security-risk-2">How COROS is addressing the security risk</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PLRb7puJ9nfFwnJTpDd69i" name="COROS-PACE-3-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Post-workout heart rate zones on the COROS PACE 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLRb7puJ9nfFwnJTpDd69i.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/06/coros-confirms-substantial-watch-security-vulnerablity-says-fixes-are-coming.html">DC Rainmaker</a>, SySS GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to COROS starting on March 14, 2025. It continued to provide more information and ask COROS for a response; eventually, on April 15, COROS responded that their "fix for the vulnerability is planned for the end of the year (2025)."</p><p>Maker followed up with COROS in late June, and its CEO, Lewis Wu, clarified that while the report focused on the PACE 3, the "Bluetooth stack is largely shared across our watches, so these vulnerabilities apply broadly to most COROS devices." This includes the COROS DURA bike computer and all recent watch models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">PACE Pro</a>.</p><p>Wu also addressed the seeming lack of urgency to these major issues:</p><div><blockquote><p>When we were notified, we started working on the issues but I have to admit the priority should have been higher. It’s a learning for COROS to prioritize security related problems. We had responded to the individual who reported these concerns with an over-simplified answer of “before the end of 2025″, but should have been more specific on the timeline with each item rather than speaking in broad terms and stated these will be fixed long before the end of this year.</p></blockquote></div><p>According to Wu, COROS hopes to resolve four vulnerabilities related to "pairing of Bluetooth devices" before the end of July, and then the "ones tied to the encryption of communication to the device" before the end of August, updating each COROS device "one by one."</p><p>COROS' support page clarifies that the PACE 3 and Pro, APEX 2 and 2 Pro, VERTIX 2 and 2S, and DURA will receive the fix by end of July, while older devices (the PACE 2, APEX 1, and VERTIX 1" will receive it "shortly after."</p><p>This security vulnerability should give fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> or Apple Watches a new appreciation for their monthly security updates, resolving any issues promptly. For smaller fitness brands, they may not have the same resources or QC, nor the same scrutiny.</p><p>We're relieved that COROS is kicking this fix into high gear, while also wishing that it had shown more urgency initially in protecting its customers' data.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the Tab S10 Lite supposedly ran through its benchmark test, which delivered a 782 score for its single-core test and a 2,637 score for its multi-core portion.</p><h2 id="affordable-points-toward-mid-range-2">Affordable points toward mid-range</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Tab S10 Lite Software tests have started ‼️Exynos 1380 chipset set to be used Build test: X406BXXU0AYF9/X406BOXM0AYF9/X406BXXU0AYF9The tablet is probably planned to be introduced with the Tab S11 series#samsung #tabS10lite pic.twitter.com/kXHYkuL37T<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1939985031759274110">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We last heard rumors about an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">alleged Galaxy Tab S10 Lite in April</a>, shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Tab S10 FE launched</a>. While Samsung's FE branding typically indicates a lower price point than its flagship models, tacking on "Lite" should (ideally) bring that down even further. Those early rumors were light, only digging up its supposed name and use of cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity (each its own variant) for the market.</p><p>However, it was also speculated that the chip could use Samsung's two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380 chipset</a>, which we've seen again today. This chip was designed with midrange devices in mind. In 2023, the chip debuted with the Arm Mali G68 GPU and an octa-core CPU featuring four Arm Cortex A78s and four Cortex A55s. There's increased speculation that the chip could support a 144Hz refresh rate, as well.</p><p>Other specs, like its display size, are still a wonder; however, the Tab S10 FE featured a 10.9-inch screen, so perhaps the Lite will arrive around there (or smaller). Additionally, Samsung priced the Tab S10 FE and S10 Plus FE at $499 and $649, respectively.</p><p>If the Tab S10 Lite drops with the Tab S11 series, we might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">have to wait until the fall</a> to see them.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-1182909916679810686&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fipad-tablets-ereaders%2Ftablets%2Fpcmcat209000050008.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat209000050008" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-2966126632566758786&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dtablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1825920675507257921&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Ftablets-laptops-computers-deals%2F&article_name=Galaxy%20Tab%20S11%20Ultra%20surfaces%20in%20new%20leak%20with%20a%20boosted%20flagship%20MediaTek%20chip&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Ftablets%2Fsamsung-galaxy-tab%2Fgalaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablet%26crid%3D2HCFROTF588S1%26sprefix%3Dtablet%252Caps%252C159%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1086904816089408270-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17070419?sid=ac-us-5673602041223193278&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

There&apos;s the "Big Deal Days" sale event in October, and Amazon has also begun holding a "Big Spring Sale" every March. Then there are typically sales around significant US holidays, such as Memorial Day and Presidents&apos; Day. </p><p>That being said, there&apos;s only one <em>true</em> Prime Day, and its offers generally beat every other sale event except Black Friday/Cyber Monday. In other words, if you want to find a great deal at Amazon, Prime Day is the best time to do it (unless you want to wait until November). </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, head to our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's worth noting that the tipster called the device by what would be its codename. The Hypernova is expected to drop as the Meta Ray-Ban 3 (3rd Gen) whenever the company is ready. Now, from the leaked rendering, we can spot a pair of glasses similar in design to the previous 2nd Gen model.</p><p>The coloring approach seems similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-and-meta-unveil-new-smart-glasses-but-good-luck-snagging-a-pair">Meta's latest smart glasses release</a> with Ray-Ban. The latest model features solid coloring for the frames; however, there was a limited edition translucent pair, which makes us wonder if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">that'll come back</a>.</p><h2 id="meta-s-vr-future-2">Meta's VR Future</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meta Hypernova and Ceres Wristband (low res) pic.twitter.com/N1QS28A5ef<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1939793338141426109">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It also seems like the arms are slightly wider, especially toward the lenses. The design of the front also appears to stick to the slightly higher aesthetic toward the sides, giving a butterfly effect.</p><p>Another interesting product alongside the glasses is Meta's rumored sEMG bracelet. Its design seems relatively similar to official images we've seen from Meta. With both devices appearing suddenly like this in a new leak, there's speculation that a launch could be fast approaching.</p><p>Speaking of launch, Luna suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1939913956992147533?t=Dzfik0Bfdt7amZHmvzq83w&s=19">in a separate post</a> that Meta could be gearing up for a slight name change. Instead of running with Hypernova or simply using Ray-Ban Meta again, these glasses could launch as the "Meta Celeste." What's more, the tipster claims the company could stylize this as "Meta | Celeste."</p><h2 id="android-games-2">Android & Games</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At least in the early firmware, Meta Hypernova (Celeste preliminary) seems to have a built-in mini-game called Hypertrail.

Luna claims the glasses might feature a game called "Hypertrail," which seems to be inspired by the retro game Galaga, and may even "involve the user's location in some way."</p><p>Meta's next-gen Ray-Ban glasses have garnered some hype, especially since this device is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">have a display built in</a>. The Hypernova (3rd gen Ray-Ban) is said to have a singular screen implanted in the right lens at the bottom. Moreover, the report from April stated the glasses could feature a full set of Android-powered computational software. As such, the Hypernova could receive a stacked array of apps already on deck; however, it might lack a full-fledged app store.</p><p>While the Hypernova probably won't replace your phone, it'll likely serve as an input alternative that still relies on that connection.</p><p>Reports add that Meta is likely working on some camera improvements for these glasses, too. Meta is expected to release these Hypernova glasses sometime in 2025, but there are already rumors of a Hypernova 2 that might sport two displays, one in each lens.</p><p>The sEMG bracelet we've seen leaked today (July 1) is something Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">playtested earlier this year</a>. The bracelet is designed to take XR (augmented reality) to new heights, giving users a more intuitive method for digital input. The sEMG is said to be "more private" than voice input when in public places, and it keeps you a little more aware, as you're not preoccupied with a handheld screen.</p><p>The bracelet also seems quite necessary for Meta's smart glasses future as, according to Sutrich, "Using a pair of smart glasses without this band is akin to using a smartphone without a touch screen."</p> ]]></dc:content>

The most important part of this discovery is the (supposed) confirmation that Samsung's preparing an official Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE launch alongside its flagship models this year.</p><p>Aside from these listings appearing, Spigen also has fully fleshed out categories for these two models.</p><p>It doesn't seem as though Spigen has posted the expected cases for the two foldables. Moreover, shortly after their appearance, Spigen seemingly removed both pages. Clicking on the link now returns a "404 Error—Oops! Not Found" page. In our most recent query, you can still see the company's official links for the would-be cases by typing "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Spigen case" in Google Search.</p><h2 id="finally-an-fe-clamshell-2">Finally an FE clamshell?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.89%;"><img id="f4JhVnZdVsEtpkLZtcJWSU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-google-spigen-listings" alt="A screenshot of Spigen's early case listings in Google Search for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the seemingly confirmed Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f4JhVnZdVsEtpkLZtcJWSU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1105" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud-Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Expecting the Galaxy Z Flip 7 flagship model seems like a no-brainer; however, we've been hearing rumors about an FE variant for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-appears-on-certification-sites-launch-imminent">more "evidence" keeps appearing</a>. A recent discovery, made through an NBTC (National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission) listing, reportedly revealed the Flip 7 FE's certification details. The listing showcased the phone's two model numbers: SM-F761B and SM-F761U, which are speculated to be Samsung's planned regions for marketing.</p><p>Aside from the NBTC (Thailand) certification, the device has also seemingly rolled through the FCC and BIS.</p><p>Now, with Spigen's early case collection slip-up, perhaps that's all we need to "confirm" the Flip 7 FE is real. But, to be safe, let's wait for Samsung.</p><p>Earlier leaks from March touched on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">the Flip 7 FE's design</a> through some leaked renders. It seems the Korean OEM is delivering an FE device that plays off the Flip 6's design with the tab-like folder cover display. Leaks claimed the phone could rock a 3.4-inch cover display (two cameras) and a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal screen. Additional rumors suggest the phone could also receive a 4,000mAh battery setup.</p><p>Rumors have been topsy-turvy when it comes to its chip of choice. Some rumors wonder if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> could power it, but the latest whispers from the grape vines say it'll be the Exynos 2400e.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-2282325611610096984&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=ac-us-4951089434236751115&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-5823325962126417475&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=More%20Galaxy%20Z%20Flip%207%20FE%20evidence%20shows%20up%20online%2C%20hinting%20at%20its%20existence&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-appears-on-certification-sites-launch-imminent" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1002821762707921502-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5992850065951796107&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-3410128764527278645&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The back isn't just unique and interesting looking, though, it does away with Nothing's trademark Glyph Interface and replaces it with something else: a micro-LED screen called the Glyph Matrix.</p><p>As the name would imply, this is an intentionally low-resolution display designed to look retro chic, similar to how the company has been using dot matrix style fonts and UI elements on its phones for years. But Glyph Matrix isn't just a cute little screen or a smaller replacement for the Glyph Interface LEDs on prior Nothing phones, it provides a whole new set of functions that build on Nothing's most unique feature.</p><p>A click of the button on the back will cycle between a battery indicator, stopwatch, mirror, digital clock, solar clock, and even a handful of bespoke games Nothing calls Glyph Toys. It also emulates Glyph Interface functions, such as per-contact notifications and progress indicators. Nothing also published a Glyph Matrix SDK for the Nothing Community to build new games, so expect lots of grassroots support for this feature.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx" name="nothing-phone-3-official-black-and-white" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the back is a trio of new cameras that fixes one of the few things we didn't like about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, including a new 1/1.3” 50MP main sensor with OIS, a 50MP ultrawide sensor, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3s-periscope-lens-in-its-latest-tease">50MP periscope camera</a> with OIS and 3x optical zoom, and a 114-degree FoV 50MP front-facing camera.

I have the butteriest butter fingers ever, meaning I drop things all the time, and the simple addition of a magnetic phone grip rewrote the script for me, literally helping me <strong>get a grip</strong>. My current favorite phone grip that's highly durable is the metallic one from UAG because it's extra sturdy. In fact, I ranked it among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">my top three phone grips</a> of all time.</p><p>Nothing beats the comfort of a PopSocket, but those things are quite flimsy in comparison to what UAG has to offer. My beloved PopSocket broke a little over a year into use, but the UAG is still going strong a year later. Since the brand focuses on the rugged smartphone accessory niche, the people behind the UAG Magnetic Ring Stand know what they're doing.</p><p>If you only buy one phone grip, this should be it. It can be used in so many different configurations, despite being a tough metallic construct.</p><p>My one gripe with this magnetic grip was that it's pretty expensive, but now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a>'s coming up, you should keep your eyes peeled for a deal on this grip. We've seen it go on sale before, so I'm certain you can nab one for a solid discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand can be used in multiple configurations, whether as a regular ring-shaped phone grip or as a phone stand in either landscape or portrait orientation.

You won't find a more durable phone grip than this. It's also quite grippy thanks to the top coat, which adds an ever-so-slight grainy matte texture. I can't name a single time when I accidentally dropped my phone while using this grip.</p><p>There are multiple ways to use the Magnetic Ring Stand from UAG. The creative design allows for a full 360-degree rotation. It also enables you to bend and contort the hexagonal stand in so many different configurations, propping up your phone at various angles and orientations.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes with a magnetic adapter ring for non-MagSafe or non-Qi2 phones, so you don't have to worry about incompatibility either. And since you get a magnetic ring, you can take the Magnetic Ring Stand off to charge your phone wirelessly or mount it on something like a car phone holder.</p><p>The UAG Magnetic Ring Stand comes in seven colors, and while this isn't anywhere near as diverse as PopSockets, it's still a pleasant collection of crowd-pleasing shades. From blues and greens to bright pink and silver hues, it's a fun selection of colors.</p><p>I'm still waiting on my UAG grip to break, but it's going strong. Based on my user experience so far, I feel confident that it's going to last me a long time. If it's the only grip you buy, this is the one to get.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In its press release, Threads stated that users can start texting each other one-on-one via DMs, without switching back and forth between Instagram and Threads.</p><p>It also noted that despite Threads being Instagram's twin, users on the platform tend to follow different accounts based on the content they put out on Threads, and introducing DMs would help users reach out to the accounts they follow.</p><p>That said, as of now, the app will only allow messages between the people who follow you and mutual followers who are 18 and up, keeping safety and privacy in mind. "As we expand messaging, we’re prioritizing safety to help make DMs another place for positive interactions on Threads," the press release explained.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7295px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.26%;"><img id="DyWLwtqm9vb8csAdqbadGh" name="Threads_DMs" alt="Threads gets DMs and Highlighter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyWLwtqm9vb8csAdqbadGh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7295" height="3156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Threads)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Threads also mentioned that it will be making improvements to DMs by bringing Group Messaging, which will allow you to connect with multiple people around a conversation. Users will gain more control over who sends them messages, and quickly filter through unread messages with inbox filters. These features will be added to messaging "soon."</p><p>That said, Threads is also rolling out a new feature that won't let you miss trending topics even if you wanted to. A new Highlighter feature will highlight trending topics in yellow, which is aimed at sparking meaningful conversations. The feature will initially appear within the content discovery sections of the app, with more placements of the highlighter coming soon.</p><p>The press release also added that as Threads enters its third year since its inception, its primary focus is on empowering communities and creators, promoting fresh viewpoints, and fostering a thriving environment for conversations. So if you're an avid Threads user, you can give these features a go right away!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Going as far back as the obscure Sony e-reader, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> have always been my jam. These days, though, Kindle is the go-to brand for most folks. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a> on the horizon, you're probably looking to buy one. I'm here to tell you not to do so.</p><p>Once upon a time, Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Kindle lineup</a> was top-notch. Everyone used to rave about the battery life and durability, and these facts still stand true about the current lineup. However, I find them too limiting considering what's available on the market now. E-paper tablets have good battery life by default thanks to the display technology, so it's not a unique selling point anymore.</p><p>Gone are the days when a Kindle was the coolest kid on the block. Its crown has been knocked over by impressive contenders like Onyx Boox, Bigme, and PocketBook. From e-paper tablets running Android or Linux and colored displays to robust stylus support and wide file format compatibility, the competition is stiff.</p><p>To be frank, Amazon is trying to compete solely on the basis of an undercutting price at this point. However, I argue that price alone is no longer enough.</p><h2 id="onyx-boox-caters-to-your-every-reading-related-need-2">Onyx Boox caters to your every reading-related need</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SdehZGECnKkPFCBK5RFu4D" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SdehZGECnKkPFCBK5RFu4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="masZfFLzn6nxGq6ruCmG2D" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/masZfFLzn6nxGq6ruCmG2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mAXMHmdbGT4on8M6rZhUpC" name="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7 vs Amazon Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAXMHmdbGT4on8M6rZhUpC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Why should you waste $100 or so on a restricted Amazon Kindle with very limited functionality, when you can add a bit more money and get something much more versatile and powerful?</p><p>For $150, the Onyx Boox Go 6 destroys the basic $110 Kindle, both of which have a 6-inch 300ppi display. The Go 6 comes with Android 11, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD slot</a>, and USB OTG support. You can install any app under the sun on it, including your own reading app.</p><p>In pale comparison, the base model 6-inch Kindle only has 16GB onboard storage and an extremely constricted OS with no third-party app support. The limited file compatibility means you can't use popular formats like CBR and CBZ for your comics or graphic novels, and there's no memory card slot. If you want more storage or the ad-free variant, you need to shell out more dough.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uMJkrdhrkcWDAAqaoZ24aK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uMJkrdhrkcWDAAqaoZ24aK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3837" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K7hcQkJX7t7P8KJPPLkX3L" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7hcQkJX7t7P8KJPPLkX3L.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2t3VhGPmdHeyL8sdGyAVoK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2t3VhGPmdHeyL8sdGyAVoK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you throw in a bit more, you can even score stylus support. The latest Onyx Boox Go 7 goes up against the $160 Kindle Paperwhite, featuring a 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display and 16GB storage. The Go 7 costs $250, but that price hike pays for itself in terms of the upgrades it gets you.</p><p>Like any Boox tablet, the Go 7 runs unrestricted Android 13, so you can install all your favorite reading and library apps. If you're feeling particularly naughty, you can install the Kindle reading app on your Onyx Boox to get the best of what Amazon has to offer.</p><p>With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, USB-C OTG support, native OCR to convert handwriting to text, and expandable storage via microSD, you can access a ton of e-books, comics, documents, and files of all manner on the Go 7. It supports stylus input, comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, has a built-in speaker, and is impossibly thin and lightweight.</p><p>Yes, you can read e-books and listen to audiobooks via Bluetooth on the 7- or 6-inch Kindle as well, but neither one has a speaker. None of the Kindle tablets do.</p><h2 id="the-value-prospect-of-a-kindle-just-isn-t-as-good-2">The value prospect of a Kindle just isn't as good</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="REPHQsR85RD2V3A9yVa5ZK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/REPHQsR85RD2V3A9yVa5ZK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nmPURZYSVawdNZ5v3aFz4L" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmPURZYSVawdNZ5v3aFz4L.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Any time you handle an Onyx Boox, going back to a Kindle is tough. It starkly highlights the handicaps of the Kindle OS and the lack of access and features on Kindle e-readers.</p><p>An Android-based E Ink tablet is so much easier to navigate out of the box, even if it is your first e-reader ever. I can't say the same for a Kindle. The Kindle OS feels slower, a little more janky, and less user-friendly.</p><p>Something as simple as sending e-books to a Kindle can be challenging. If you use the email method, the first one always ends up in spam. You need to go to the Amazon website on your computer to greenlight it.</p><p>Onyx Boox makes the process as simple as possible. You can generate a QR code that can be scanned by another device to directly send files. Alternatively, installing a web browser or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage app</a> enables you to directly download your files from the internet onto your e-reader. I like to store all my files on Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive and download them onto my Boox directly.</p><h2 id="a-better-e-reader-delivers-a-superior-reading-experience-2">A better e-reader delivers a superior reading experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D6pHmfAEagxsWBXHqkiJfK" name="Onyx Boox Go 7" alt="Onyx Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6pHmfAEagxsWBXHqkiJfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To sum up, an Onyx Boox tablet has an open-ended OS with unlimited potential. You don't have to pause and think about small actions, like whether you can send a certain file to your e-reader or worry about compatibility issues.</p><p>Since the Kindle OS is intentionally limited to the Kindle Store and a web browser, it's harder to use other reading platforms such as Libby, Wattpad, Crunchyroll, and WEBTOON. You're also denied the opportunity to seamlessly view and edit documents on a beautiful e-paper screen using apps like Google Docs, Microsoft 365, Adobe, or Canva.</p><p>With Amazon's crisp display quality and robust battery life, the basic formula started out right. But with everything else in perspective, it's a world of missed opportunities.</p><p>Anything and everything related to reading or writing is easier, more versatile, more interactive, and so much better overall on an Onyx Boox tablet. Regardless of the model, these E Ink tablets don't disappoint. So why should you settle for a cheap Kindle?</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a518bb6a-3bb5-467c-b1fd-8d6e1419c313">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9dqyqFEEphU7SvsE22sDd.jpg' alt="Onyx Boox Go 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Go 7</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Light delight</strong></em></p><p>The Onyx Boox Go 7 is one of the cheapest e-readers offered by the brand, but it doesn't cheap out in any way.

In fact, I am confident that there isn't a better value deal in existence at the moment. This is coming from a long-term OnePlus fan who had given up on the brand completely, so you can trust my word.</p><p>Currently, the OnePlus 13R costs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/"><strong>$549.99 at Amazon</strong></a> for the standard 12GB/256GB version. The retail price is usually $599.99, so you save $50. However, I highly urge you to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> to score a sweeter discount on the phone. Based on past sales, there's a high likelihood of OnePlus treating us to a deliciously enticing deal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe" name="oneplus 13r reco 500x500" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus 13R:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$599.99</del><strong> $549.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Not big on spending close to a thousand dollars on a solid Android phone? Forget about the Google Pixels and Samsung Galaxies of the world. The OnePlus 13R is an all-rounder with powerful performance you can rely on. It sports a stunningly lightweight design with IP65 dust and water resistance, an insane 6,000mAh battery that lasts two days with heavy use, and a stunningly crisp 120Hz AMOLED display with HDR10+ and 4,500 nits of peak brightness. The price is already fantastic on this phone but if you're patient, you can catch an even better deal on this phone once Amazon Prime Day rolls around in just a few days' time.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p"><strong>$599.99 at Best Buy</strong></a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/OnePlus-13R-Global-Version-Smartphone-Snapdragon-8-Gen-3-120Hz-Display-6000mAh-Battery-55W-SUPERVOOC-12GB-256GB-Black/15656004325"><strong>$599 at Walmart</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong> you need robust performance from your phone and a long-lasting battery life that recharges quickly. Value-for-money is the key driver here.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want fabulous photography, since the 13R doesn't have the best cameras for a mid-range phone.</p><h2 id="more-for-less-2">More for less</h2><p>Samsung and Google used to dominate the top tier of the Android space, but OnePlus has made an admirable comeback in the last few years. The brand that touted the indomitable "never settle" spirit had lost its spark after the OPPO merger, but things are better than ever before now.</p><p>I switched to Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices after OnePlus lost its charm. But after I got my hands on the nifty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, my entire perspective on the brand shifted. What's impressive is that the newer iteration, the 13R, is an even better phone, and it still costs so less! Compared to any other mid-ranger, the $550 price tag for 12GB/256GB memory and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor</a> is unthinkable!</p><p>For reference, the 8GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> variant costs $599, whereas the 8GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> is priced at $585. Performance-wise, both the Pixel's Tensor G4 and the Galaxy's Exynos 2400e are miles behind the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset powering the OnePlus 13R.</p><h2 id="what-i-love-about-the-oneplus-13r-2">What I love about the OnePlus 13R</h2><p>The OnePlus 13R retains everything I love about the 12R, including a generous battery and blazing quick charging. There's an extra 500mAh on the 13R, meaning the 6,000mAh cell lasts two days on average. And when that runs out, the included 80W charger recharges the device at lightning-fast speed. There's no wireless charging, but the lack of it isn't felt at all thanks to the amazing battery and charging specs.</p><p>On the performance side, there's no need for me to tell you just how capable the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC is. It boasts a 30% increase in performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and 20% better efficiency with the same workloads. Flagships like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> are powered by it, so having this kind of power on such an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable budget phone</a> is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>The only aspect of the 13R that doesn't feel as premium is the camera lineup. Although the main camera has been bumped up and there is now a telephoto lens included as well, the auxiliary lenses aren't as capable as the primary lens. This is the one area where the Pixel 9a ekes out a victory over the 13R. That's not to say the picture quality is bad; it just pales in comparison to alternatives like the 9a.</p><p>All in all, I don't think this should be a deal breaker for anyone. With a mid-range budget, it's hard to tick all the boxes. You need to shell out around $700 to $800 at least in that case. If you keep your photography expectations within reason, the OnePlus 13R won't disappoint you. It is the smartest purchase you will make.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Design-wise, the Middleton II looks quite similar to the company's original Middleton and even the Emberton series. Marshall touts its latest speaker as a compact device that's small enough to be "thrown into a bag whenever the moment calls for it." With dimensions like 9.05x3.86x4.33 inches, the Middleton II is a small (yet loud) travel buddy.</p><p>Moreover, Marshall highlights the speaker's expected outdoor use. The speaker has been granted an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance.</p><p>One key update with the Middleton II is its ease of use. Marshall says the speaker's controls have been reworked to be much simpler. The device now features a multidirectional control knob for "instant" music access and the ability to "twist or press" the knob to play, pause, and skip tunes, as well as volume adjustment and call answering.</p><p>When it comes to sound, Marshall states the Middleton II takes its sound a step further when used on the highest setting. Cranking the speaker up to max now should award consumers with "deeper bass and more refined performance." Additionally, the press release draws attention to the speaker's 360-degree True Stereophonic Sound.</p><p>Marshall remains confident that the Middleton II can "fill a room" with your favorite tunes.</p><h2 id="more-than-just-a-speaker-2">More than just a speaker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:499px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:120.24%;"><img id="LyHsnKwpB37KXduGsKcfXh" name="marshall-middleton-II-cream-color" alt="The Marshall Middleton II portable speaker in a model's hand by its strap in a cream color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyHsnKwpB37KXduGsKcfXh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="499" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Marshall Middleton II is ready for whatever road trip or family outing you've got planned with over 30 hours of battery life. Marshall's Ebba Gouverneur Regnström, product manager, states, "extending portable playtime is something we put a lot of work into at Marshall, and Middleton II is no exception with its 30-plus hours."</p><p>Regnström adds, "With support for LE Audio, listeners can also enjoy a more efficient and enhanced listening experience."</p><p>With such a large battery, Marshall highlights users' ability to get enough juice to get going again in just 20 minutes on the charger. More importantly, the post states the Middleton II can double as a power bank. Essentially, the speaker has your phone's back whenever things get tough—power-wise and for phone calls. The speaker also features a built-in microphone, and its Bluetooth connectivity lets users utilize it to its fullest extent.</p><p>Users can answer phone calls completely hands-free with the Middleton II.</p><p>Following today's press release, Marshall states the Middleton II launches "globally" today (July 1) for $329. This launch is restricted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marshall.com/us/en">to its official page</a> for the time being. Those looking to grab the speaker from official retailers will have to wait until July 15.</p><ul><li><strong>Speaker deals: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/portable-wireless-bluetooth-speakers/3944_96469_615879"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/audio/portable-speakers-docks-radios/pcmcat310200050004.c?id=pcmcat310200050004"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bluetooth+speakers&crid=1B2AQSMN8GMER&sprefix=bluetooth+speake%2Caps%2C242&ref=nb_sb_noss_2"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/bluetooth%20speakers"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Bose discontinued its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/bose-sleepbuds-ii-review">Sleepbuds</a> without a replacement, and Philips did the same. That leaves only a handful of reputable brands making high-quality sleep earbuds in 2025.</p><p>One of those brands is Soundcore, a subdivision of Anker, whose Sleep A10 and Sleep A20 are <em>both</em> on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-sleep-headphones">best sleep earbuds list</a>. Now, the company is taking pre-orders on Kickstarter for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.soundcore.com/sleep-a30-smart-anc-earbuds-for-sleeping" target="_blank">next-generation Sleep A30</a>. For the first time, the Soundcore Sleep A30 feature active noise-canceling, but also come along with a $50 price hike compared to the prior model.</p><p>I've been testing (and sleeping with) the Soundcore Sleep A30 for a week, and they knock it out of the park. As a side sleeper, I was impressed with how the Sleep A30 earbuds managed to comfortably stay in my ears most nights with zero pressure or discomfort the morning after. The sound quality and active noise-canceling are great considering the earbuds' size, too.</p><p>However, a steep retail price of $230 means that interested buyers should consider whether the Sleep A30 can double as everyday or workout earbuds to make the investment worthwhile.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-top-notch-with-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Comfort is top-notch with the Soundcore Sleep A30</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-9" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all else, comfort is the most important aspect of sleep earbuds. They need to be designed to be compatible with a variety of sleeping positions and preferences, and they're especially tricky for side sleepers like me. Sleep earbuds that are too bulky and protrude from your ear canal too much will cause discomfort as soon as your head hits the pillow.</p><p>Soundcore's Sleep A10 and A20 were already outstanding in this regard, as they kept an ultra-low profile. That gets better with the Sleep A30, as these earbuds are 7% smaller than the older models. This was immediately noticeable because after twisting the buds into my ears, they sit nearly flush. While lying on my side, I quickly forgot the earbuds were in my ears at all.</p><p>Something that shocked me while testing the Soundcore Sleep A30 was how well they fit securely in my ears without creating pressure or congestion. Usually, when I wear earbuds to sleep, they either fall out during the night or cause a ton of congestion after waking up. Neither happened while testing the Sleep A30 — I never felt discomfort, and the earbuds only fell out on one occasion.</p><p>Some of this can be attributed to the Sleep A30's small form factor, and the rest results from excellent ventilation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-3" alt="The wingtip sizes and instructions that come with the Soundcore Sleep A30." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-2" alt="The silicone and memory foam eartips that come with the Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I used the medium silicone eartip on the left earbud and the small silicone eartip on the right, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-best-fit-your-true-wireless-earbuds">plenty of customizable tips included</a> in the box. You get four sizes of silicone eartips and three sizes of foam eartips, plus three sets of wings. Between the flexible wings that help lock the earbuds in place and the variety of tip sizes and materials, just about everyone should find a Sleep A30 combination that works for them.</p><p>Soundcore explains that the silicone eartips will probably be more comfortable, while the foam eartips have better sound isolation and a firmer fit. If you can deal with the slight hassle, I'd consider wearing the silicone ones to sleep and workout, with the foam ones being best for daily wear.</p><h2 id="sound-quality-and-anc-are-better-than-you-d-probably-expect-2">Sound quality and ANC are better than you'd probably expect</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-8" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, sound quality isn't the main goal for sleep earbuds. These aren't going to replace my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, AirPods Pro 2, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> in terms of sound quality, but the Sleep A30 held their own. There wasn't an overemphasis on any part of the soundstage — you can make out the lows, mids, and highs.</p><p>You do get booming bass with the right song, simply because the passive sound isolation is so good that the vibrations stay mostly trapped within your ear canal. There is a sense of warmth in the Sleep A30's sound signature, but I didn't mind it, especially considering their intended purpose. The volume is also excellent, allowing you to sleep at 50% or below comfortably, which is great for battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-7" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over Bluetooth, you get 6.5 hours of playback with ANC on for each earbud, and a total of 35 hours with the charging case, according to Soundcore. This was about what I experienced during firsthand testing. After a full night of Bluetooth listening, my Sleep A30 earbuds were dead or almost dead when I woke up. In local mode, while listening to white noise or nature sounds downloaded to the earbuds themselves, that bumps to nine hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>This is all with active noise-canceling enabled, so you can presumably squeeze out some extra battery life by flipping that toggle off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-App" alt="The Soundcore app showing the Sleep A30 settings and screenshots." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-5-review">The app is solid</a>, with controls for ANC, sleep sounds, alarms, AI features, and more. However, you'll probably use it more than you'd like. The on-earbuds controls leave a bit to be desired. A double-tap of the right earbud is supposed to toggle ANC on or off, but these taps can be unreliable. You might find yourself tapping a bunch before the earbuds will recognize it, or just give up and use the app instead.</p><p>The sleep alarms were particularly helpful, as they wake you up more gently than a traditional alarm. Still, they are contingent on your earbuds lasting the entire night on a single charge, so I didn't feel comfortable using the Sleep A30 as my only alarm.</p><p>Active noise-canceling worked as expected, blocking out most sounds without causing discomfort. That said, the Sleep A30 are so good at passive sound isolation that I found I didn't need ANC on most nights, especially while playing music or sounds. This feature could be handy for someone with a specific need to block out sound, like a person living in a noisy shared space.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Should you buy the Soundcore Sleep A30?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-1" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Soundcore Sleep A30 are really good, but if you already own a pair of Sleep A10 or Sleep A20, you might not need to upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">Active noise-canceling</a> is the key differentiator here, and people who don't need ANC might prefer to save a few bucks by going with the cheaper Sleep A10 or A20 instead.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, you can make the Sleep A30 a great value despite its $230 retail price if you commit to using them for multiple purposes.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-oracle-mkii-review">Oracle MKII</a> showcased what it can deliver in the mid-range, and it built on that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Prestige LTD</a>, a high-end offering with a unique tuning.</p><p>But it's the Monarch series that defines the brand; the Monarch MKIII was introduced at the end of 2023, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii">retails for $999 on Linsoul Audio</a>. Like the Fiio FX15, the Monarch MKIII uses a tribrid configuration of drivers that includes dual dynamic drivers, six Knowles balanced armature drivers, and two Sonion EST drivers within each shell. Combine that with Thieaudio's sound signature, and the Monarch MKIII continue to be a phenomenal choice in 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Thieaudio wanted to differentiate just about every facet of the Monarch MKIII, starting with the design. The IEMs are sold in a standard resin shell, for an additional $100, you can heavily customize the design. There are six shell colors available, and 14 different faceplate options, giving you extensive customizability that you just don't see with other IEMs in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="GgiiXJFtT7n3xjGcE2CiPK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgiiXJFtT7n3xjGcE2CiPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4885" height="2752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only downside to going with a customized design is that it takes anywhere between two weeks to a month to get the product, but that isn't too bad considering you get a unique style. I got the standard variant, and while it doesn't stand out quite as much as the custom colors, it still looks quite good.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="GKdPBLk5GRSF3e43QHprPK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKdPBLk5GRSF3e43QHprPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The shell is made out of a resin material, and you get the usual stainless steel sound tube. Build quality is excellent, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the Monarch MKIII. Fit is quite good too, but the IEM is on the bigger side as these things go, so you may see issues with the fit if you're got smaller ears. That said, it has a contoured design that ensures it stays in place once you wear it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="j5eioYz9efirKD2aStm2TK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j5eioYz9efirKD2aStm2TK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5021" height="2828" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You get a selection of foam and silicone ear tips with the Monarch MKIII, and it isn't any different to what's included with other Thieaudio IEMs, which is a shame. Fiio does a much better job in this regard, with its high-end FX15 coming with double the number of accessories.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PaDKWVvxgM5Frz9rDtW7ZK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PaDKWVvxgM5Frz9rDtW7ZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4985" height="2808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You should still get a decent fit from the options included in the package, and Thieaudio's bundled cable is of a good quality. It connects to the buds via the standard 2-pin connector, and there's an interchangeable plug at the other end that lets you switch between 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm with relative ease.</p><p>I like the case Thieaudio provides with its products; it has a durable design and does a good job safeguarding the IEMs and the cable. The packaging itself is suitably high-end, and Thieaudio did a good job in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="US55d6PFknVqToMvXEpFcK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/US55d6PFknVqToMvXEpFcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The standout with the Monarch MKIII is the sound; Thieaudio deserves credit for creating a dynamic sound that shines across various genres.

That was true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/edifier-r1280dbs-review">R1280DBs bookshelf speakers</a> or the RGB-enabled see-through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/edifier-qd35-review">QD35 </a>that came with a built-in GaN charger. Edifier clearly likes the idea of integrating GaN charging into its products, because the QR65 also has the feature.</p><p>The QR65 is an active desktop monitor; just hook it up to power and add a source device, and you can start listening to music — no need to use an amp. I got the white color option, and it looks elegant thanks to the faux leather construction. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edifier-Speakers-Function-Bluetooth-Subwoofer/dp/B0CSYLQTPD">at $499 on Amazon</a>, the QR65 isn't affordable by any measure, but it has a few key advantages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gCqEoY9xcy4evHHfedYvTg" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCqEoY9xcy4evHHfedYvTg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's obviously the design; the QR65 looks distinctive thanks to the white chassis and a baffle that has LED lighting. That in itself makes the QR65 stand out in my book, and Edifier did a fabulous job with the lighting; it uses a custom TempoAbyss tech that mirrors the lighting effects, and the overall look is stunning. There are 11 presets as standard, and you can customize the lighting via Edifier's ConneX mobile app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The LED lighting doesn't look tacky in the least, and if anything, it gives the QR65 a futuristic design that looks great on a desk. The design itself is clean, and other than Edifier branding, you don't get any logos on the front fascia. The brand includes stands in the package that let you angle the QR65, and this is a welcome addition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The metallic stands look good and complement the look of the QR65, and a minor quibble in this regard is that they have a tagline etched onto the front that says A Passion for Sound. The only other issue I have with the QR65 is that it doesn't come with a remote. I used the remote extensively to control the R1280DBs, and that would have been nice in this scenario as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The QR65 doesn't take up that much room on a desk, and as is the case with powered monitors, you get an active speaker (the one on the right), and the left is a passive unit. The right unit has physical controls, including a multifunction button that lets you cycle through connection modes. You also get a volume knob, and an LED brightness knob that lets you adjust the intensity of the lighting or disable it entirely if that isn't to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's decent connectivity at the back; you have standard RCA in as well as USB-A, and as I was connecting the QR65 to my Windows gaming rig, I used the latter. What I particularly like is that it has a subwoofer out, and this is handy — I connected the QR65 to an Edifier T5 subwoofer, and it made a huge difference.</p><p>Another differentiator is the ability to connect to your phone via Bluetooth; the QR65 has a Bluetooth 5.3 modem, and I was able to pair it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and several dozen devices in the course of the last 12 months. It even has LDAC integration, so you're able to stream music at up to 96kHz/24-bit over Bluetooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest plus point of the QR65 is the inclusion of an integrated GaN charger. The rear of the right satellite houses two USB-C ports as well as a USB-A port, and you get 65W of charging potential over the USB PD standard. This feature is the reason why I used the QR65 on my desk for the better part of a year — it's just so much more convenient to charge devices this way.</p><p>The USB-A port goes up to 60W on its own, and the USB-C1 and C2 ports hit 65W individually. They have the standard PD power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3a (27W), 12V/3A (36W), and 20V/3.25A (65W). You get the total 65W power budget when both USB-C ports are in use, with the power split into 20W and 45W. I had no issues charging devices with the QR65, and Edifier deserves credit for bundling this feature into its active monitors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the audio, each unit of the QR65 houses a 1.25-inch tweeter with 15W power alongside a 20W 2.75-inch woofer, with the total RMS power at 70W. There isn't much in the way of sub-bass with these monitors, but that's a given considering the size of the drivers. Other than that, you get a balanced sound with clean mid-bass articulation, natural mids, and good treble.</p><p>Although the sound is quite good in its own right, you'll need to connect a subwoofer to make the most of the QR65's potential. Other than that, Edifier did everything right with the QR65; the monitors have an elegant design, good sound, and 65W GaN charging is the icing on the cake.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="af9b05d4-dbd4-47f4-94ad-d3b7a14f50b0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XueYA98mZruqyxK7Njegse.jpg' alt="Edifier QR65 Active Monitor Speakers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Edifier QR65</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The QR65 is a great studio monitor in its own right, and the inclusion of a 65W GaN charger gives it much greater versatility. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

These features don’t just block the tricks; they also alert you when something shady is going on.</p><p>With Android 16, Google is beefing up your phone’s defenses with the addition of the “Mobile network security” setting. It’ll flag sketchy stuff, like unencrypted connections or networks fishing for your device ID, both common stingray tricks. You’ll also be able to shut off 2G entirely, cutting off one of the easiest ways for snoops to get in.</p><h2 id="stingrays-aren-t-just-for-law-enforcement-2">Stingrays aren’t just for law enforcement</h2><p>While law enforcement agencies have used them for surveillance, they’re not off-limits to shady individuals either.

Google's move here is a major step toward keeping your phone conversations and data safe from these silent threats.</p><p>The newest Android update, which arrived earlier this month, brings these security upgrades. Supported devices now get a toggle for “network notifications."</p><p>Flip it on, and your phone will alert you if it connects to an unencrypted network or if that network tries to grab your device's unique identifiers. Both are red flags for shady stuff like stingray attacks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both Pro models could see a higher battery capacity, with the Pixel 10 Pro getting 4,870 mAh capacity, and the Pro XL could show up with a large 5,200 mAh battery, the largest yet for a Google Pixel phone.</p><p>The website further notes that the Pro and Pro XL models will achieve higher charging speeds due to their Qi2 compatibility, with 29W and 39W, respectively, in addition to 15W wireless charging speeds.</p><p>As for the phone's camera, both models are not expected to receive any major camera changes, with the same 50MP primary sensor, 48MP ultrawide lens, 48MP telephoto lens, and a 42MP selfie camera. However, despite similar lenses, the devices are expected to capture higher-quality images, as the website alleges, because the telephoto and ultrawide cameras could see higher apertures, which would allow for brighter and more detailed macro photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-5K1-1420x799" alt="The leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google might change things up with the phone's storage, the leak suggests that the Pixel 10 Pro will sport 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will skip the 128GB model, and offer 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB — signaling Google's move to offer a premium experience on the XL variant.</p><p>Earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor">rumors</a> suggest that these phones will show up in four colorways: Obsidian, Green, Sterling (Grey), and Porcelain (White).</p><p>However, these are still leaks, and it remains unclear if these specs will show up on the actual device.

Apple say its has two billion. Are these numbers real?</strong></em></p><p>Man, what a cool question. As someone who loves Android <em>and</em> numbers/math, I love it! Thanks so much for asking.</p><p>First, the easy answer: yes, those numbers are real. Google and Apple know they can't just lie about things that are verifiable because the hit to their reputation would be rough, at least for a little while.</p><p>They don't mean what you probably think they mean, though. If you pay attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-android-3-billion-active-devices">what they are saying,</a> you'll notice they never actually say three billion people; they say devices. And the way devices are counted is a little squirrelly, too.</p><p>For the deeper answer, you have to start with what Android is. Android is a trademarked, privately built operating system owned by Google. It is built using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>, the base code given away free for everyone. It's also open source, meaning that you can download the code and build it yourself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because of its licenses, most changes made to the original AOSP do not have to be open source or have the new code made available. Android is just that: software made using open-source code with changes done by Google, and then further changed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-could-show-up-on-older-galaxy-devices-this-month">companies like Samsung</a>. To use the name Android, you must <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/docs/distribute/googleplay/promote/brand.html" target="_blank">follow all of Google's rules</a>.</p><p>One of those rules is allowing access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a>. For that, the software has to meet a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">bunch of other requirements</a> concerning interoperability, so an app that works for one device should work the same with another. As long as they are the same type of device, that is.</p><p>Remember, an Android device doesn't have to be a phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">Wearables</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablets</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">media streamers,</a> and more can also be powered by Android, and that means they also have access to Google's Play Store and other apps.</p><p>Finally, you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They also run Android in a way, and they are counted when it comes to the more than three billion devices tag.</p><p>How they get counted is what <em>really</em> matters.</p><h2 id="monthly-active-devices-2">Monthly active devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-google-play-store.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro using the Google Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your Android-powered devices regularly communicate with the Play Store if it's turned on and connected to the internet. Besides the analytics that Google loves to collect, they check for updates and work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> to keep bad apps away from the device.</p><p>As long as a device communicates with the Play Store at least once every 30 days, it is counted as an active device. That means it is part of that 3 billion+ statistic. An old phone you have lying around that only gets powered on occasionally will be counted as active for the month(s) it has been turned on at least once. The same goes for a TV box in a spare room you rarely use or a tablet you never pick up.</p><p>This also means that you are <strong>one</strong> user, but your devices are counted individually. I have two Android phones, one for work-related breaking of software and one for me to use. I also have an Android tablet, two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> TV boxes, three Chromebooks, and a smartwatch. I'm one user with eight devices that get counted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If everyone were like me, that would mean that the three billion devices are used by <em>only</em> 375 million separate people. Of course, not everyone has eight devices; some have one, and some have more than eight.</p><p>I'm not able to find any verifiable numbers concerning actual <em>users</em> and not devices. What I've seen ranges from four to seven billion people, but without the methodology showing how the numbers were reached, what they tell me is useless. And I'm not going to guess.</p><p>I can say that there aren't 3 billion+ people out there with an Android phone, though.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The lawmakers, Representative John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi, have apparently pushed the U.S. Commerce Department to look into OnePlus after alleging the devices are collecting user information "without explicit user consent."</p><p>According to the two Representatives, this investigation would "determine" the types of information being collected by OnePlus devices, which could involve "transfers of sensitive personal information and screenshots."</p><p>These lawmakers explain that this interest in an investigation is the result of an "analysis" by a commercial company. It's been reported that the information provided "indicates" potential unwanted data collection by OnePlus devices, which is then sent to China-owned servers.</p><p>In its research, Reuters states the U.S. Commerce Department did not comment immediately about this potential probe. Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this potential probe by the U.S. Commerce Department, but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="cause-for-concern-2">Cause for Concern?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The U.S. government tangled with another recognizable Chinese brand back in 2020.

This went on during President Trump's first term, which granted the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-administration-postpones-full-ban-huawei-another-45-days">a 45-day ban reprieve</a>, but this was for companies here in the States.</p><p>In a statement, the Commerce Department stated the extension on the Temporary General License was to prevent any "disruption" of network communication systems for those in rural areas. Huawei tried to combat its U.S. ban, calling it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-lawsuit-calling-us-ban-unconstitutional-has-been-dismissed">unconstitutional</a>;" however, it was quickly refuted by a judge who dismissed the lawsuit.</p><p>On the other hand, hearing "security concerns" reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fcc-urges-tiktok-removed-app-stores-over-security-concerns">another ongoing situation</a> in the U.S.: TikTok. In 2022, the ByteDance-owned app was under fire for the belief that it was collecting U.S. user data, which was then being accessed in China. At the time, the U.S. Federal Communications commissioner, Brendan Carr, stated, "it harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show is being accessed in Beijing."</p><p>We've since gone through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">a TikTok ban</a>—and its return—and we're still dealing with it today, as Trump granted the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">a 75-day reprieve</a> back in April. While the Trump Administration has expressed its interest in keeping the app around, it wants to do so in a way that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">ByteDance isn't comfortable with</a>.

I sailed through my teens, 20s, and half of my 30s without giving much thought to my long-term health or wondering if a gym life would be the right fit for me. However, something changed around 35, and I've been using smartwatches, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 3,</a> to track my heart rate and ensure that I'm not overexerting myself.</p><p>But I'm learning that there's so much more to workout tracking than just heart rate monitoring, and it took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit Balance 2</a> to get me to this point. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and have since gone on several hikes, multiple paddleboarding sessions, and plenty of WODs at HEW Fitness, my favorite local CrossFit-style gym.</p><p>And while I've even taken several watches and smart rings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/two-smartwatches-one-spartan-race-no-winners">on Spartan races</a>, a lot of the data I'm given has to be combed through and manually compared in a way that I don't usually take the time to do. That's all changing for me with the Amazfit Zepp app.</p><h2 id="effortless-tracking-2">Effortless tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7oTdMJ8GFRsofk9dv3TN5" name="zepp-app-food-logging" alt="Logging an afternoon snack in the Amazfit Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oTdMJ8GFRsofk9dv3TN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Shy of having a robot humanoid alongside me to log everything I do — I'd rather not have that for robot apocalypse reasons, if nothing else — I can't see workout and health tracking getting any easier than what Amazfit has crafted here.</p><p>Let's start with food logging. I'm <em>horrible</em> at logging my food. Even the slightest bit of friction to the experience will make me stop. I've tried all the popular apps over the years and have given up on all of them. Doubtless, something better has come along since the advent of modern AI tools like ChatGPT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, but Zepp builds it in for me, and I don't have to juggle multiple apps or services.</p><p>Right on the main screen, I can log food in one of two ways: take a picture or use a voice/text prompt. Just before I wrote this, I went upstairs and grabbed some tuna and crackers for an afternoon snack. I took a picture of the box of crackers and another of the tuna pouch. Bam, afternoon snack logged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW" name="amazfit-zepp-app-ai-powered-food-logging" alt="Logging food in the Zepp app easily with AI voice prompts and photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before that, though, I was really craving some Oreos. I forgot to take a picture of it because I left my phone in my office downstairs, but I know I only took a single serving of Oreos because I'm at least good about looking at the label and grabbing what I should. So I told Zepp I ate "one serving of Oreos." Two seconds later, my poor nutritional choice was logged for AI to judge me with.</p><p>Yep, I could definitely get used to logging food this way. Even taking a quick voice journal of the stuff I ate throughout the day and dropping it into the text prompt section of the app will log everything I ate, from that errant piece of Dominos pizza my friend offered me while we were playing games, to the smoothie I ate with one banana, a cup of almond milk, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and a scoop of protein powder after I left the gym.</p><p>Better yet, the app provides you with insights based on what you've logged, including how much you've exercised, how well you slept, and more. This morning, it suggested that I try adding fruits or vegetables to my breakfast to make it more balanced. After realizing I had forgotten to log my orange juice, that insight alert disappeared.</p><p>Best of all, you don't need a paid subscription or a specific phone to make this all work. This is a dream come true for me, and I can't believe how well it works!</p><h2 id="how-about-the-workouts-2">How about the workouts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB" name="amazfit-balance-2-orange-04" alt="The Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love the accuracy and comfort of both the Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3, I've never used a watch that understands what I'm doing quite like the Amazfit Balance 2. This week, two of our WODs (Workout Of the Day) at the gym included barbell exercises. I know from wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watches</a> that some watches are better at tracking workouts like this than others, but the Amazfit Balance 2 was on a totally different level.</p><p>I selected "strength training" before beginning the workout, then selected my weight and the number of reps I planned to do. Each round, I clicked the lower button on the watch, adjusted the weight and number of reps, then hit go.</p><p>After I was done, I sat down to look at the data the watch generated and couldn't believe my eyes. It got all the expected stats — average heart rate, calories burned, etc. — but then I scrolled down and saw the <em>muscle groups</em> I worked. "How could it possibly know this?" I wondered. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> also offer this feature, but they are often slightly more expensive than Amazfit's watches, and I find the app to be somewhat convoluted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-01" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Scrolling one more "page" down revealed the answer. During each rep, the Amazfit Balance 2 uses its sophisticated sensors to identify exactly what you're doing during those logged reps. But this isn't just some generic list of activities; this is a list of <strong>thousands</strong> of things, all sorted by different muscle groups.</p><p>OK, so it picked up my deadlifts correctly on Tuesday, but how about Friday's back squats? Surely these activities are similar enough to trick it? Nope. Right in the app after my workout today, "Barbell squats" stared me in the face. It's been a long time since I've felt like technology was magic — my job makes me a little jaded, what can I say — but <em>man</em>, does this feel like magic.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, it also gives me insights for consistency, stability, continuity, rhythm, and speed decay, all with personalized descriptions that actually make sense. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be able to interpret this data in a meaningful way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.82%;"><img id="Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD" name="amazfit-zepp-app-detailed-workout-tracking" alt="Detailed workout data collected by the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch, compiled in an easy to read way by the Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the watch is just as fantastic as this experience, too. So far, it's lasted me nearly a week on a single charge, and there's nothing here that feels like it's a lesser experience when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a>.</p><p>Zepp has an app store that offers a wide range of content, from utilities like calculators to games like Sudoku, yoga courses, and more. I'm not someone who uses extra apps on smartwatches very often, but everything I felt like I needed to use was either already included on the watch or found in the Zepp app store.</p><p>And, much to my surprise, responding to messages on the watch was as easy as could be. At first, I was confused because you have to swipe on a notification to get actions for it — this seems more like an iOS paradigm than an Android one — but once I figured this out, things were swell.</p><p>I've been super impressed with smartwatches lately. The Amazfit Balance 2 feels like another upgrade on my previous favorite, the OnePlus Watch 3, and I think you'll love it, too!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="94122f63-789d-4818-a9d6-dde0de924257">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Sapphire-Display-Offline-Battery/dp/B0F9JFCYNX/" data-model-name="Amazfit Balance 2" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:109.33%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSaiNZg6ZDAPszhXuEhQvg.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Amazfit Balance 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get insightful AI-powered coaching that actually works!

We're still waiting for this to happen, but we do at least know what Garmin data you'll be able to share to other Android fitness apps.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=JToBEy0jfe6pIygark2Ui5">Garmin Support page</a> describes the activity data that Garmin Connect will share after a workout in a "one-way transfer" to Health Connect:</p><ul><li>Active and Total Calories burned</li><li>Cycling Pedal Cadence</li><li>Distance</li><li>Elevation Gained</li><li>Heart Rate data</li><li>Speed information</li><li>Steps</li><li>Swimming Strokes</li></ul><p>Aside from running power, cadence, and sweat loss, most of Garmin's core workout data will be shared with other apps.</p><p>More generally, Garmin Connect will share the following Wellness data to Google Health Connect:</p><ul><li>Body Fat</li><li>Calories Burned</li><li>Floors Climbed</li><li>Heart Rate Data</li><li>Sleep Data</li><li>Steps and Step Distance</li><li>Weight</li></ul><p>While "Sleep Data" is vague, we hope that it includes specific stats like blood oxygen saturation, heart rate variability, body temperature, and resting heart rate — all categories that Health Connect can share.

The support page says that "Garmin will not receive any data from Google," which means you can't do a workout with a Galaxy or Pixel Watch and see the results in Garmin Connect.</p><p>As of the morning of June 30, the latest Play Store update of Health Connect doesn't show Garmin Connect.

There are roughly 30 new features that are on the way and rolling out today (June 30) for no extra cost. Gemini and NotebookLM are at the core of a few features educators can expect "in the coming months." Regarding the former, Google states educators can soon utilize Gems (custom Gemini versions) for their students.</p><p>Teachers can create a specific variant of Gemini based on their teaching material. This will create a Gemini that's an "expert" in that particular subject, bringing tailored assistance to students who may need extra help or would like to dive deeper into their learning.</p><p>NotebookLM comes in to create "interactive study guides and podcast-style Audio Overviews." Students can run through these guides to understand them better in a more condensed way, and the Audio Overviews can open chances for questions.</p><h2 id="furthering-education-with-a-gemini-assistant-2">Furthering Education with a Gemini Assistant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A" name="google-classroom-notebooklm-study-guide" alt="Google Classroom gains NotebookLM to create useful study guides for students with Audio Overviews." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.13%;"><img id="WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9" name="google-classroom-ai-teaching-tools" alt="Google is rolling out over 30 new AI features for educators, like create a lesson plan or create a rubric or quiz." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What teachers can expect starting today (June 30), Google highlights Gemini's ability to "generate content from a central destination in Classroom."

When it comes to creating lesson plans with Gemini, Google states educators need to provide a "target grade and topic" before the AI can deliver a first draft. Teachers can continue to revise the lesson plan with Gemini, as it suggests potential useful videos and more.</p><p>These features are starting to roll out globally for educators in English "over the coming weeks." If you're interested in joining Google's pilot program, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edu.google.com/pilot/">sign up for the AI track</a> in Classroom.</p><p>To end, Google highlighted a few features that it has plans to implement in Classroom for educators. These features include a more "flexible" Read Along mode. Teachers can now upload their own content; however, there are plans to introduce Gemini-created stories for "real-time support" for books students may be interested in. Educators are also gaining a "silent reading mode" and a "listening mode" soon for comprehension insights.</p><p>Soon, Classroom will receive support for the learning standards of learning institutions. Google says it knows that not every institution abides by the same standards, so it has partnered with 1EdTech and Common Good Learning Tools to give such places the ability to publish their standard via CASE Network 2. Moreover, "in the coming months," educators will be able to "tag coursework with relevant learning standards or skills, and view new analytics of student performance."</p><p>Google reiterates an earlier Classroom rollout in June that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/06/new-class-analytics-and-insights-in-google-classroom.html">new analytics and insights</a> to educators about their students.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Looking at what each phone brings to the table can help you decide which is a better fit, especially if you’re looking for performance, long battery life, or reliable long-term software support.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 adds a few standout features, like wireless charging and a built-in stylus. But Samsung’s Galaxy A36 holds its ground with more software updates and a sleeker overall design. Lets take a deeper look at thiese two mid-range phones.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-design-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 face down with the pen on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As expected in this Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Samsung Galaxy A36 analysis, the two phones share more than a few design choices. Both feature an under-display fingerprint sensor, a plastic frame, a USB-C port, right-side buttons, and rounded corners. Beyond those shared design options, the Moto G Stylus 2025 adopts a more distinctive design approach.</p><p>Motorola’s phone borrows design cues from its premium lineup, with a look that loosely resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch" target="_blank">Edge 50 Ultra</a>. It stands out with a stove-like camera housing and a vegan leather back, offering more texture and grip than the Galaxy’s smooth glass. It's also slightly lighter, weighing 191g, and comes in two bold Pantone shades: Gibraltar Sea (deep blue) and Surf the Web (vibrant medium blue).</p><p>The phone measures 162.2 x 74.8 x 8.3mm and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, which is noticeably less durable than Samsung’s choice. However, Motorola compensates for this with a higher IP68 rating, making the phone more water-resistant than the Galaxy A36, which Samsung claims can survive submersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-lifestyle-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy A36 5G lifestyle ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Motorola goes for bold and textured, the Galaxy A36 leans into Samsung's signature sleekness. The phone has a more refined shape than previous A-series models, featuring flat edges and subtle curves around the buttons that make it more comfortable to hold. Thinner bezels give the display a more modern look, and the new pill-shaped camera layout gives it a more cohesive rear design.</p><p>Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and a glass back that gives it a more premium look. Whether you prefer something subtle or bold, the phone is available in black, white, lime, and lavender. It weighs 195g, making it heavier than the Moto, and measures 162.9 x 78.2 x 7.4mm. The Galaxy A36 boasts a respectable IP67 rating, but it falls short of its rival's higher protection level.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-display-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL" name="samsung galaxy a36 gaming" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones feature a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh. However, Samsung uses a Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy A36, while the Moto G Stylus 2025 opts for a standard pOLED. That gives Samsung a slight edge in color tuning and contrast, especially in bright environments.</p><p>Where they really start to differ is in brightness, resolution, and overall utility. The Moto G Stylus 2025 pushes ahead with a higher 1220 x 2712 resolution, 3,000-nit peak brightness, and a larger 89.3% screen-to-body ratio. It also comes with a built-in stylus, making it more practical for note-taking and creative work.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 has a lower peak brightness of 1,900 nits and a 1080 x 2340 resolution, accompanied by a smaller screen-to-body ratio of 86.5%. Between the sharper resolution, higher peak brightness, and extra utility of the stylus, the Moto G Stylus 2025 clearly comes out ahead in this category.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-hardware-and-specs-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A36-5G-snapdragon" alt="The Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1597" height="898" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Android phones share a surprising amount of hardware for two budget-friendly phones.

The Moto G Stylus 2025 supports 68W wired charging and even incorporates 15W wireless charging, a rare feature in this price range. It comes with a 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C sensor, a 13MP ultrawide, and a 32MP front-facing camera that shoots 4K videos and delivers impressive detail. You can expand the Moto G Stylus 2025’s storage up to 1TB via microSD, and it comes in a single 8GB RAM configuration that still runs smoothly.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 includes a triple camera setup with a 50MP Sony IMX882 sensor, an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro lens. Both the front and back cameras can also record in 4K, but the selfie camera on this model is only 12MP. Samsung offers more flexibility with 6GB, 8GB, or 12GB of RAM, but availability varies by region, and the Galaxy A36 doesn’t offer expandable storage.

If you want a built-in stylus, faster charging, and a clean Android interface, the Moto G Stylus 2025 is an easy recommendation. However, if long-term support and more storage options are more important to you, Samsung offers a stronger overall value.</p><p>The A36's six years of updates are hard to ignore, but Motorola counters with useful extras, such as stylus support and a less cluttered interface. At this price, neither phone is a bad choice. It just depends on what matters more to you.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="94d7ac5e-ce75-4227-b776-3a884669e9ff">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q8hjHr8JG7Yu36wce5jTT5.jpg' alt="Motorola Moto G Stylus 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Motorola G Stylus 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Wireless charging and built-in stylus</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 stands out with extras you rarely see under $400, including 68W fast charging, 15W wireless charging, and a built-in stylus.

However, it is likely that the upcoming tri-fold phone isn’t S Pen-friendly as the handset is expected not to feature the digitizer.</p><p>Further, the handset could be coming with a “G-shaped fold style” — a supposedly inward folding mechanism.

Considering that NotebookLM started out as a limited research project in 2023, earning its own mobile app is a big milestone for the AI-powered study tool.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> mobile app has almost completely replaced the web-based equivalent for me, I was skeptical that this would be the same for the NotebookLM app.</p><p>Despite the name, NotebookLM isn't a note-taker like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android">Notion</a>. It's more of a research and study tool, capable of using AI to parse and converse about complex topics with a lot of specific context.</p><p>As it turns out, I was both right and wrong to be skeptical of NotebookLM's Android app. It's going to be a helpful companion for existing NotebookLM users, but it likely won't be a great first impression of the service for new users. The Gemini-powered research tool is simply better suited for the desktop — let me explain why.</p><h2 id="what-s-good-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's good about the NotebookLM mobile app </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-5" alt="The Studio tab in the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with a high-level overview of what NotebookLM does. It takes a collection of sources about a topic to form a "notebook." Each of these sources can contain up to 500,000 words, and you can put 50 of them into a single notebook. This gives your NotebookLM project its own context based on the sources provided, whether they be websites, YouTube videos, PDF files, or your own notes.</p><p>After you've selected your sources, a Gemini model within NotebookLM gets to work. It's not always clear <em>which</em> Gemini model is at work — Google seems to update it often, but we know it's at least a tweaked version of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">the Gemini 2.5 series is already stable and public</a>, it's possible the model working behind the scenes has been updated.</p><p>From there, NotebookLM can do a lot — including chat with you based on the context of your sources, provide summaries, generate spoken Audio Overviews, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-2" alt="The button in the NotebookLM app for Android that lets you join an Audio Overview conversation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mobile version of NotebookLM works best with notebooks you've already created. After opening the app for the first time, you're greeted with a list of your existing notebooks alongside the option to create a new one. With sources already uploaded, one of your current notebooks is ready to go for text-based chats or spoken Audio Overviews.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> are the best part of the NotebookLM app, as they can be downloaded to your device for offline listening. Of course, this takes a while — the generation process for an Audio Overview takes around 5-10 minutes, and the download takes additional time on top of that. It's such a lengthy process that the app reminds you that you can close it and do something else while an Audio Overview is created. And sometimes, it'll fail entirely.</p><p>But when it does work, it's pretty glorious. You can listen to the podcast-style Audio Overview based on your study topic while driving, taking the train, or doing just about everything else. Downloaded content helps eliminate some of the stutters you might experience while trying to play an Audio Overview on a mobile network. You can also "join" an Audio Overview to get your podcast hosts on the exact topic you need help with, which is neat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-6" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Audio Overviews are perhaps the most popular feature included with NotebookLM — so popular that they've since been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">added to the Gemini app</a> and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-search-test-understand-confusing-topics-test">experiment in Search Labs</a>. Really, it feels like the NotebookLM mobile app for iOS and Android is just a player for Audio Overviews, because aside from the chat function, there's not much else this app can do at the moment.</p><p>That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it's important to keep your expectations tame if you try this app as a potential replacement for your favorite note-taker.</p><h2 id="what-s-bad-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's bad about the NotebookLM mobile app</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-1" alt="The homepage of NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The limitations of the NotebookLM mobile app compared to the web client are why I kept wanting to use the fully-featured desktop experience instead. One of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">the best NotebookLM features added recently</a> is called <strong>Discover sources</strong>, and it effectively takes the work out of your hands when creating a new notebook. You'll type in a few keywords, like "Algebra I" or "The American Revolution," and NotebookLM will find good sources on the web and automatically add 10 of them to a new notebook.</p><p>There's also an <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong> button, which is a nod to Google Search's <strong>I'm feeling lucky </strong>button. As you might have guessed, this tool picks a random topic, finds sources about it, and adds it to a new notebook. It's perfect for the curious-minded person who just loves to learn new things.</p><p>I was excited to use this feature in the NotebookLM mobile app, but I quickly found out that it wasn't there. It's quite disappointing because the process of adding sources to a notebook using the Android app is tedious. It involves a ton of window-switching and copying that isn't suited for a small screen, even if the NotebookLM shortcut in the Android share card is handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-7" alt="Adding sources to the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, it feels like a missed opportunity, and it isn't the only one. You also can't <em>create</em> a note on the NotebookLM mobile app. On the web, you can make a brand-new, text-based note in a notebook on the fly and later convert it to a source. This feature is notably absent on the mobile app, and it severely limits its capabilities as an Android note-taker.</p><h2 id="for-now-the-notebooklm-web-client-isn-t-going-anywhere-2">For now, the NotebookLM web client isn't going anywhere</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-4" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, Google is aware of these limitations. In its introductory blog post, the company said that "this first version of the app includes many of the core features of NotebookLM — with more refinements and features to come in the months ahead." I'm hopeful that in the future, the NotebookLM app will become on par with its desktop counterpart.</p><p>For now, though, the NotebookLM app on iOS and Android isn't that useful. It's the only way to download Audio Overviews to your mobile device, so if that feature sounds appealing to you, it's worth using. Otherwise, you should probably stick to the web client — that's what I'm going to do.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Having used the StormBox Blast, the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tribit-stormbox-blast-2-ultimate-bluetooth-party-speaker">StormBox Blast 2</a>, and the diminutive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a>, I can say with some confidence that Tribit knows what it's doing in this area.</p><p>The Blast 2 continues to be a terrific all-rounder if you need a party speaker, but it is quite heavy, and it's overkill in most situations. That's where the StormBox Lava slots in; it is considerably smaller — and easily portable — but you still get 80W of sound in total, and all the extras. The StormBox Lava is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B0DN5F9BC2">available for $139 on Amazon</a>, and that's a decent value when you consider the caliber of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other StormBox products, the Lava has a design that doesn't grab much attention. It's sold in a black color option, and while the build quality is great, you miss out on fun colors that are offered with Bose and Ultimate Ears products. That's a minor quibble as these things go, because the color ultimately doesn't make much of a difference in usability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Lava has an oblong design, and while it doesn't have 360-degree sound, you get four audio drivers that deliver a total of 80W of power. The back of the unit houses the ports — behind a protective cap — and you get USB-A alongside USB-C and a 3.5mm jack. Thankfully, the Lava charges via the standard USB-C port, so you don't have to worry about using a dedicated barrel connector.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What I like about the Lava is that it gets a strap that lets you carry it around.

Like other Tribit products, the focus is clearly on low-end energy, and the Lava produces a rumbling bass that makes listening to modern music highly enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="ZtabToD8GvfUEkNHFiE4FT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZtabToD8GvfUEkNHFiE4FT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4931" height="2777" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need even more bass, the custom XBass mode provides a noticeable difference to the rumble and energy. The sound quality in general is oriented toward bass-focused music, and if that's what you like listening to, you'll definitely enjoy the tonality of the Lava.</p><p>Tribit lets you adjust the sound to some degree via its mobile app, and although there isn't a 10-band EQ, you get to tweak the sound in a meaningful way. The speaker has rubber feet at the bottom that ensures it stays planted, and at 6.13lb, it isn't heavy enough that it's cumbersome to carry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of that weight has to do with the battery; the StormBox Lava has a 42.3Wh battery, and it delivers over 18 hours of use between charges with XBass mode enabled. That's a good thing, because charging the speaker takes over five hours, and there's no fast charging. An interesting addition is reverse charging — you can use the Lava to charge your phone at 10W.</p><p>The only feature that's missing is high-res codecs; the Lava has the standard SBC and AAC codecs, and you don't get any AptX. This is an issue with most Bluetooth speakers anyway, and honestly, it isn't a huge limiting factor. At the end of the day, the StormBox Lava produces highly detailed sound with a clear bass-focused signature, and it's a definite contender if you need a powerful Bluetooth party speaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40b006-9df4-49c6-8ead-fb1e9140089c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.29%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQxtChvydi678rAbtAoptm.jpg' alt="Tribit StormBox Lava"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Tribit StormBox Lava</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With powerful sound and a portable design, the Lava is a terrific Bluetooth party speaker. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

These kinds of patents—like the one tied to “control signal mapping” for LTE—are supposed to be shared fairly across the industry under FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms.

It distils the fundamentals of a NAS into an easy-to-use device that comes with an integrated hard drive, and it exceled at backing up photos, videos, and documents.</p><p>The biggest issue with the BeeStation was that it didn't have any way to stream media, limiting its usability significantly. Thankfully, Synology is addressing that with the introduction of the BeeStation Plus; it shares the same design and feature-set as the standard model, but comes with an 8TB hard drive, and you get the ability to install Plex, turning it into a centralized media server.</p><p>The addition of Plex makes the BeeStation Plus that much more versatile, and if you just need a hassle-free way to back up important data and stream media, this starter NAS may just be the ideal solution.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-pricing-and-availability"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2pqZycFeK3zucwggnRT2iE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pqZycFeK3zucwggnRT2iE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Synology unveiled the BeeStation Plus in May 2025, and it is now available globally.

The BeeStation Plus is sold in a single configuration with an 8TB integrated hard drive (BST170-8T), and while we may get additional storage models down the line, that isn't the case right now.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-design-and-features"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GC6HYYUbHv3uspQnU6CNnE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GC6HYYUbHv3uspQnU6CNnE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The BeeStation Plus looks identical to the regular model, and Synology didn't change the design to any noticeable degree. The design is just as unobtrusive as DiskStation models; you essentially get a black box that you slow next to your router, and the vertical chassis doesn't take up much room.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rgxZ92uVJrAExJbtphBArE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rgxZ92uVJrAExJbtphBArE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The front has an LED status indicator, but is otherwise plain. You get BeeStation branding on the sides, and the back has the power button, USB-A and USB-C connectors, and a solitary Gigabit Ethernet port. There's no active cooling, with the BeeStation Plus instead getting a ventilated design at the top and bottom that cools the integrated hard drive passively.</p><p>The NAS is powered by the Intel Celeron J4125, and it comes with 4GB of RAM, which is a good choice as there's no way to extend the memory on the device. There's an 8TB HAT3310 drive integrated into the NAS, and that alone makes up half of the $409 asking price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-performance"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Performance</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pzMyC324CSEZfDpeNxPr5F" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzMyC324CSEZfDpeNxPr5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the regular BeeStation, Synology is careful to not dub the BeeStation Plus as a NAS; instead, it is a "private and family cloud storage" solution. The difference is evident when you set up the product; unlike the traditional DiskStation Manager (DSM) software, the BeeStation Plus uses BeeStation OS, which is a lightweight OS that has limited utilities.</p><p>You get just BeePhotos and BeeFiles as standard, and these two utilities are derivatives of what Synology provides on its DiskStation models. If anything, the mobile BeePhotos app is nearly identical to Synology Photos — which is a good thing. I like that the brand retooled its existing utilities instead of reinventing the wheel.</p><p>That said, you miss out on most of the extras that you get on standard DiskStation models. There's no way to install apps on the BeeStation Plus, nor can you use it as a mail server, private audio streaming platform, or any of the other useful features you get on most DiskStation devices.</p><p>If anything, that's the allure of the BeeStation Plus; it's billed as a hassle-free solution that lets you store photos and other data in a centralized area, and it does just as good a job backing up data from connected devices. I didn't see any issues with uploading photos and videos taken on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> to the device via BeePhotos (it automatically uploads photos to the BeeStation Plus in the background), and I was able to back up data from my gaming rig with relative ease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="75QPHvrkgzXNhthRQwygCF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/75QPHvrkgzXNhthRQwygCF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the ability to back up data from public cloud provides like Google Drive to the NAS, and that's just handy. You get user management as well — allowing you to share the BeeStation Plus with family members — and it uses the same relay network as DiskStation models when connecting to the device from outside your home network.</p><p>You can do these things with the regular BeeStation as well — where the BeeStation Plus stands out is the ability to stream media. You can install Plex, and set up a media server on the device that lets you stream movies and TV shows to any device in your house. Plex isn't installed out of the box; you'll need to go into the system settings and select the Integration tab to download the media server, but as soon as it's installed, it's just as easy to set up and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZwQ6yTWg2UjoPqEEX5aXSF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwQ6yTWg2UjoPqEEX5aXSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the hardware, the BeeStation Plus has the Intel Celeron J4125, a stalwart in this category. I used dozens of NAS models powered by this platform, and it is a reliable workhorse that delivers good performance and hardware transcoding. While it is showing its age, there aren't any issues in day-to-day use, and the BeeStation Plus does a good job when it comes to backing up data as well as streaming media to connected devices on your home network.</p><p>Actually, the fact that the BeeStation Plus has transcoding gives it a definite advantage over some of the newer DiskStation models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">DiskStation DS925+</a>. I didn't notice any problems using Plex on the BeeStation Plus, and it handled 4K content as well as transcodes effortlessly. The BeeStation Plus is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS models</a>, and if you just need the essentials, this is the ideal product.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-the-alternatives"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EeYgQsd4HN4ZHmE7VCmDAF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EeYgQsd4HN4ZHmE7VCmDAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't want an integrated solution and instead need the extensibility of a full-fledged NAS, the DiskStation DS224+ is the model to get. It has the same Celeron J4125 platform as the BeeStation Plus, and you get the full DiskStation Manager software, allowing you to install a host of extras.

That’s more pressure on Meta, as the lineup of serious players in the AI eyewear game keeps growing.</p><p>Spec-for-spec, Xiaomi’s new AI glasses seem to leave <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> in the dust. With its in-house Super XiaoAI assistant doing the heavy lifting, you get real-time translation on the fly and even the option to pay just by looking, thanks to a built-in camera that plays nice with Alipay (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/xiaomi-ai-glasses-meta-smart-glasses-features/" target="_blank">Road to VR</a>).</p><p>These glasses can scan a QR code, then double-check with the voice assistant to make sure you’re actually making the purchase, the company said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/2202387347/PymaCq168" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>.</p><p>Xiaomi’s AI Glasses include a 12MP ultra-wide camera, letting you snap pictures or shoot first-person video hands-free using voice commands. These glasses are capable of identifying objects in real time and translating text, enhancing their functionality beyond simple point-and-shoot photography.</p><h2 id="battery-beast-2">Battery beast</h2><p>One big standout with these smart glasses is battery life. They claim up to 8.6 hours of use off a 263mAh cell with USB-C charging. That’s a big leap over Ray-Ban’s Meta pair, which top out at just 4 hours on a smaller 154mAh battery.</p><p>At just 40 grams, these smart glasses pull double duty as open-ear headphones. You get stereo sound and five built-in mics. Under the hood, a Qualcomm AR1 chip teams up with a Hengxuan 2700 co-processor to keep everything running.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.21%;"><img id="NoHF5XDCZ9raoDiabwjRGm" name="Xiaomi-AI-glasses-on-face" alt="Xiaomi AI Glasses worn on face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NoHF5XDCZ9raoDiabwjRGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="658" height="587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Designed with Asian facial features in mind, these glasses sport temple arms that pivot 12° outward and tilt 5° forward. That tailored design pretty much hints this version won’t be heading for a global launch anytime soon.</p><p>With an IP54 rating, these glasses can handle sweat and splashes. For extra flair, you can swap in electrochromic lenses that adapt to light on the fly when you double-tap the temple, after which they shift shades in 0.2 seconds, as per Xiaomi's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/discover/article?id=5172" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>Xiaomi’s standard AI Glasses hit shelves at CNY 1,999 (around $280), landing right in the same ballpark as Meta’s Ray-Bans. If you want auto-tinting lenses, the monochrome electrochromic version goes for CNY 2,699 ($375), while the color version tops out at CNY 2,999 ($420). Style-wise, you’ve got three frame options to choose from: Classic Black, Parrot Green, and Translucent Tortoiseshell Brown.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Mostly that comes down to new features like running tolerance, impact load, and projected race time, along with all the training load tools you know and love. But you're also paying $750 for the best possible accuracy.</p><p>So, how accurate is the Garmin Forerunner 970 for GPS tracking, heart rate, step count, and supporting data like training load? I put its Elevate v5 HR sensor, dual-band GPS, and other sensors to the test across weeks of activities, comparing its results against satellite maps, chest and arm HR straps, and my usual step-counting app.</p><p>The end result? The Forerunner 970 is shockingly accurate. It gives you reliable health and fitness data from workouts, then spits out data from its algorithm that predicts your cardiovascular and biomechanical fatigue with surprising accuracy.</p><p>It sucks that the Forerunner 970 price tag is so high, but Garmin makes a valiant effort at justifying it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-heart-rate-accuracy"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: Heart rate accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NPsyNNMgmUcfkVYGA9egab" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-polar-h10-and-coros-hrm" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a Polar H10 chest strap with the COROS HRM armband to its left." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPsyNNMgmUcfkVYGA9egab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Across several runs, I used my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">Polar H10</a> chest strap and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM</a> armband as control groups against the Forerunner 970. Optical armbands are more consistent and responsive than wrist-based optical sensors in my experience, a good comparison point. Chest straps are the gold standard, but smartwatches <em>always</em> trail behind them; your best hope is for the results to be close.</p><p>First, I used the Forerunner 970 and Polar H10 on a short jog to a track, then a hard track workout. For the first activity, both devices ended with a 145bpm average and 157bpm max, but I'd expect similar results for such a short run.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2041px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.47%;"><img id="uTd4XLb64b7q5hhQyRSanW" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-vs-Polar-H10-HR-results-chart-jog" alt="A heart rate graph superimposing the results from one run from the Polar H10 chest strap and Garmin Forerunner 970." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTd4XLb64b7q5hhQyRSanW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2041" height="928" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The chart shows that the Forerunner 970 responds rapidly when my heart rate climbs, but is about 10 seconds slower to recognize falling heart rates than the chest strap.</p><p>(Side note: Polar tracks HR when an activity is paused, but the exported graph shows a flat line, weirdly.

The Garmin Fenix 8 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">50 steps off after 10,000 steps</a>, and my colleague Derrek found that the Forerunner 570 was 40 steps off in his own test.</p><p>These results are all pretty solid, and Garmin watches are great at avoiding false-positive steps during the day. However, the pricier models didn't yield better results, and Garmin has never mentioned upgrading its accelerometers or gyroscopes. I assumed the Forerunner 970 step count accuracy would be comparable.</p><p>I started the test with 1,735 steps and walked for 5,000 steps, holding my phone in my right hand to track them with a counting app while my left arm swung freely. At 5,000 steps, I took another four steps to sit down on a bench and checked the total: 6,739 steps. Yep, 5,004 <strong>exactly</strong>.</p><p>I felt simultaneously stunned at the accuracy and annoyed that people probably wouldn't believe the result. So I stood back up and walked another 5,000 steps as twilight fell into evening to check if it was a fluke.</p><p>I checked my total: 11,740 steps, aka another 5,001. That makes the Forerunner 970 <strong>off by one step after 10,000</strong>.</p><p>I can't guarantee you'll get comparably exact results; it may depend on your gait, or if you hold a phone or trekking pole in your watch-side hand.

It's also about whether the Garmin Forerunner 970's training data is both accurate and helpful.</p><p>At the core of Garmin's Firstbeat Analytics data is your VO2 Max, lactate threshold, training load focus, and recovery time. These focus on cardiovascular data, and while I can't <em>know</em> if my VO2 Max is accurate without going to a lab, its rises and falls do correspond to real-life changes in fitness — but slowly.</p><p>I personally prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/endurance-score/">Endurance Score</a>, which shows my fitness trends across the past few months that will translate into actual speed and longevity during runs, with more exact data than the VO2 Max graph shows.

Your body's biomechanical strain on muscles and joints differs from your cardiovascular fatigue, but past models couldn't track that.</p><p>How well do they work? I already wrote earlier this month about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">useful and accurate running tolerance is</a>! The Forerunner 970 correctly judges when long runs put too much impact load on my body past its tolerance. I ignored the data the first time and ended up hurting myself; now I'm back on the cusp of my body's limit, and I'm being more cautious.</p><p>After every run, it calculates the impact load based on factors like your cadence, the elevation change, and intensity. I've found that Garmin's estimate has always correctly judged the relative impact load — like recognizing that a blistering two-mile track workout might cause as much strain as a normal four-mile run — across this past month of training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only new feature that I find a little suspect is the race predictor tool (shown above) that guesses how fast I'll be able to run a race weeks from now at my current training pace.

Wiping off a screen is easy, but cleaning charging ports and speaker grills can feel a bit more daunting. Otterbox, the company you might know for their rugged cases, thinks it has a solution. It's called the Mobile Device Care Kit, and it aims to give you everything you need for a deep cleaning for less than $5.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDscHSNu2JanirSWM2oMzd" name="Otterbox-Detailing-Kit-2" alt="The tin box of the Otterbox Mobile Device Care Kit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDscHSNu2JanirSWM2oMzd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The brand says it's like a detailing kit for your phone, which caught my attention.

Whether it’s Prime Day or Black Friday, I find myself buying things I normally wouldn’t and that are normally out of my price range, because who knows when the next time that TV or laptop will be this cheap?</p><p>It’s just as easy to spend a lot of money on a smartphone. My favorite phone this year is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, a phone that costs $1,299, or just as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Of course, they go on sale every now and then, but will be discounted by a couple of hundred dollars or even more <em>if</em> you trade in a phone.</p><p>But to be honest, you don’t need to spend a ton of money on a phone to have a great device. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Affordable phones</a> keep getting better every year, with companies like Motorola and Google offering more for less. At Moto G or Pixel A-series prices, you don’t even have to wait for a sale; these phones offer plenty of value year-round at full MSRP. A Prime Day discount would just be the cherry on top.</p><h2 id="packed-with-specs-2">Packed with specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GM9qx4BHdQjWgPXFpq2xvD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-3" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 stylus menu with the stylus on the display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GM9qx4BHdQjWgPXFpq2xvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3833" height="2156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I recently reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, and I was thoroughly impressed with just how good a phone it is.

It's an important day for many businesses as well as the economy as a whole — spending money seems to make the world go 'round.</p><p>It's also a favorite time of year for scammers and thieves. Unfortunately, it's not legal to corral them all up and make an old-time Celtic bonfire, so to them, it's worth the time and effort to try and steal your stuff or your money. You can avoid it.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech</p></div></div><p>I hate having to write about this, but I hate scammers and their filthy tricks even more. While they're always out there looking for a victim, big pre-planned sales like Prime Day bring them out of the woodwork. Flies, manure, and all that.</p><p>What you need to know is how they operate and the easy-to-spot tricks they will try to pull. Everyone can get scammed or robbed, but people who aren't paying attention are the best targets because the easy methods often work; besides being crooks, scammers are usually lazy too, and will look for the easy way every time.</p><p>That means it's pretty easy to avoid most of the garbage with a healthy level of paranoia.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-phishing-and-what-to-look-for"><span>Phishing and what to look for</span></h2><p>When millions of packages are on their way to millions of people, scammers know it's a great time to trick you into handing over your information. Be wary of any messages you get about the things you bought or are looking to buy, or from an online retailer about your account.</p><p>The first thing to do is check who it's coming from. If an email says it's from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1044329426159419900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&article_name=I%20hunt%20tech%20deals%20for%20a%20living%2C%20and%20these%20are%20the%2030%20items%20on%20my%20Black%20Friday%20wish%20list&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fbest-black-friday-tech-deals-30-picks-2023" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4793154559124295172-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, but it came from some random bullsh*t place like <em>backup-mailer.com</em>, <strong>it's fake</strong>. Best Buy emails come from bestbuy.com, Amazon emails come from amazon.com, eBay emails come from ebay.com, etc.</p><p>Also, look at <em>why</em> the message says you need to take action. It's easy to grab a few images and forge an email, but a scammer doesn't know what you bought or when you bought it. The same goes for delivery companies — UPS might need to send you an email about a package it has to deliver to you. If they do and it's legit, it will be for something you actually ordered from a website you actually used and will be from UPS's actual website, not some random place.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:452px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.64%;"><img id="hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb" name="Phishing-email-Amazon-Prime-Day.png" alt="Phishing email example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="452" height="482" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An example of a phishing email regarding an Amazon account. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Check Point)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also typically need to create an account to make a purchase from an online retailer. That means scammers know you probably have an Amazon or eBay account, and it's common to see a fake email that sends you to a fake website that looks just like the real thing, where it asks you to sign in.</p><p>Once a thief has your username and password, they'll order stuff that ships quickly using your real payment method. They get free stuff, and you get to try and fix the mess — it's a lot easier to look closely at a message and be sure it's legit.</p><p>Remember — never trust a message unless you know who it came from. Retailers like Walmart or Amazon have their own infrastructure and won't farm out a company that uses a goofy web domain to provide customer service.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-your-credit-card-number-is-the-same-as-cash"><span>Your credit card number is the same as cash</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ" name="Google-Wallet-logo-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="The Google Wallet logo on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, you find a great deal from a website that's not a household name.

Credit card numbers are literally money, and they're far too easy to steal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="JoU2yjBZDQYrpHc7LhiRU4" name="google-pay-klarna-integration-announced-hero" alt="Klarna announces Google Pay integration for more Buy Now, Pay Later options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JoU2yjBZDQYrpHc7LhiRU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Klarna)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of ways to prevent this, and the easiest way is built right into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. If a website gives you the option to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> Pay or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay">Google Pay</a>, use it every time you buy something. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-pay-adds-klarna-expands-buy-now-pay-later-checkout-options">Klarna recently announced Google Pay integration</a>, so you can use your virtual card to pay later for things, which is great.</p><p>PayPal is another option that hides your credit card number, and many online retailers, big and small, accept it. I know many people don't like PayPal for one reason or another, but it is an option, and it will keep some ne'er-do-well from getting your card number and security code.</p><p>It is also worth checking if your card provider offers the option to use a virtual card. These links directly to your account, but they use a randomly generated number and special software to authorize purchases and are pretty foolproof.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sellers-can-be-scammers"><span>Sellers can be scammers </span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.26%;"><img id="smpwZiSohjS3rGqANissxc" name="fake-reviews.png" alt="Real versus fake reviews" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/smpwZiSohjS3rGqANissxc.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="374" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ReviewMeta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but a lot of products you see at online retailers (Amazon in particular) are from sellers that really shouldn't be allowed to be there.</p><p>These aren't first-party sellers. For example, you can buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> on Amazon from Samsung, Amazon itself, or someone else who might not be as trustworthy. Always buy from a name you know and trust whenever you can. That goes for lower-priced items like cables or phone cases as much or more than big-ticket items like a phone or a laptop.</p><p>Third-party sellers who aren't legit do two things to try to trick you. First, they will assemble a lot of fake reviews that simply give a high star rating or use a few short words like "Great!" or "Good seller!" to make you feel more trusting. It doesn't take a lot of fake reviews to drive the rating up, even if there are some more legit and worse reviews posted. Always take a peek through the product reviews before you click to see what you're looking at and who is selling it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.25%;"><img id="nRwBaEKtxS48iJQ7zaCZ34" name="amazon-fake-review-data-breach_0.png" alt="Amazon Fake Review Data Breach" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRwBaEKtxS48iJQ7zaCZ34.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: SafetyDetectives)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, it's also easy to farm fake reviews by offering to give away products to anyone with a webcam and a willingness to lie for free junk. These are harder to spot, but they often don't read like they're very genuine, because they're not.</p><p>Another trick is to slowly increase the price in the weeks and months leading up to the Prime Day, allowing them to offer a bigger percentage off and claim it as a deal. If a product usually sells for $10, getting it for $8 is a nice deal. If the price is increased so that the $10 product is listed for $18, it looks like a super deal when it's listed at $8.</p><p>Use services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">ReviewMeta</a> to help you make better shopping decisions!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-packages-are-like-a-magnet-for-thieves"><span>Packages are like a magnet for thieves</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RQpGTQYVT5MhWvzB9dT6fS" name="google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-linen-button-push-alt.jpg" alt="Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 2nd-gen) Linen button push lifestyle alt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQpGTQYVT5MhWvzB9dT6fS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago, I had a visit from a Porch Pirate, and I was mad as hell about it. What they stole — it was a bag of cactus potting soil — wasn't important, but it was <em>my</em> cactus dirt. I hope their plants choked on it.</p><p>To fix the problem, I bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FYale-Smart-Delivery-Box-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0876XGP3Q%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1226465198452524678-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Yale Smart Delivery Box</a>. It's a large bin with a smart lock, and the delivery person drops off my items in it, where they stay safe until I retrieve them. Maybe cactus dirt doesn't need high-tech protection, but some other things we order do.</p><p>You probably don't need to buy a big box to protect your packages because you live close to a locker of some sort. You can find an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-amazon-locker">Amazon Locker</a> in most places, and UPS has them, too. You can also have your packages held for pickup at the post office or delivery company, or have them sent somewhere like The UPS Store. The packages stay safe and out of the weather, so you can pick them up when you have the time.</p><p>If you live out in the sticks as I do — at the time, the closest locker was about 30 miles away — you should invest in your own smart locker if you buy a lot of stuff online. Thieves are especially interested in porch boxes this time of year.</p><p>Another great way to deter package theft is with a smart camera. Something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hello-doorbell-can-now-tell-you-when-package-has-been-left-your-doorstep">Nest Doorbell</a> is conspicuous and will capture a person trying to steal your stuff.

There is nothing anyone can do about that; when you make technology "smarter," people will find a way to use it to hurt other people.</p><p>AI can do everything I've talked about here. AI can easily send out thousands of phishing emails or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">RCS messages</a> every day, and if even a few people get suckered in, it was worth it because AI is a lot cheaper than an army of crooks with keyboards.</p><p>AI can be programmed to harvest credit card numbers or account details from computers and systems infected with malware. It's actually <em>really</em> good at it because those details are unique and stand out.</p><p>AI can even be used to track the movement of packages, so someone knows when that big boxy Amazon truck is in your neighborhood.</p><p>Worst of all, AI makes it easier to do this if someone is willing to figure out how to ask the right things.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1178px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.71%;"><img id="8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF" name="imagen-3.jpg" alt="Imagen 3 announcement at I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1178" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI goes a step further, though. Imagine getting a message from your spouse saying they can't remember the Amazon password. It could even be a voice mail message using their voice. AI makes this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">simple to fake</a>.</p><p>I'm serious — I could do it. If I can do it, that means people smarter and more crooked than I can do it even better, and they are. With enough time and effort, you can get a phone call or a message from the right person, originating from the right place, asking for just about anything.</p><p>You <strong>can</strong> avoid this. If I were to get a message from my wife asking for a card number or a password, instead of answering it, I'd pick up the phone and call her. Only after knowing that I was talking to my wife would I entertain the idea of sharing my information.</p><p>The same goes for a shipping company like UPS or an online retailer. <strong>Never</strong> click a shortened URL link that can go anywhere, even if you're sure it's legit. Pick up the phone and call a real customer service number. I know everyone hates talking on the phone but it just might save your ass.</p><p>Now go on and spend more than you can afford on things you didn't really need anyway. Just be a little wiser and less trusting because it's that time of year again</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a time to raise awareness about the causes of preventable injuries and highlight ways to stay safe. In 2025, technology is a key part of that. The best Android phones have built-in tools and features for personal safety, including some you may not know about.</p><p>Most people looking for a flagship Android phone will probably be choosing between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, the Google Pixel 9 lineup, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>. Each of these devices has its own personal safety features, plus the default options built into Android. Depending on which phone you choose, you'll get a different set of personal safety features.</p><p>In light of National Safety Month, we're going to highlight the personal safety suites available on each of these popular phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-backs-all-colors-05" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 series does include a respectable set of personal safety features, the story of this lineup is untapped potential. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-series-could-borrow-this-safety-feature-from-apple-and-google">has a car crash detection sensor that is currently unused</a>, and a satellite connectivity feature that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-supports-satellite-connectivity-but-theres-a-catch">left up to carriers rather than being universal</a>.</p><p>The smartphones do have an Emergency SOS feature that can be used to get help in an emergency. Once you've set it up, clicking the Galaxy S25's power button three or four times will initiate Emergency SOS. This will send an SOS message with your location in both address and map form to your emergency contacts.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> adds a unique capability to the standard Emergency SOS feature. You can optionally set Emergency SOS to automatically capture a photo with the front and rear cameras. Another toggle lets your phone send and record a five-second audio clip as well. This could help give your emergency contacts and first responders crucial context for your situation.</p><p>Aside from Emergency SOS, your Galaxy S25 will also support medical info viewable from the lock screen and wireless emergency alerts. It'll also use satellite connectivity if you have Verizon service.</p><p>You can view all of the available options by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigating to <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.

A professional driver spending tens of thousands of miles on the road annually might similarly consider Car Crash Detection an essential feature.</p><p>It's worth considering your own habits and needs before making a choice, and don't forget that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> have unique personal safety features of their own.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company recently took to X to confirm that the device will show up with a 50MP periscope lens. Nothing said that the camera is "built for creators," and while the camera's optical zoom capability also remains under wraps, the company shared a couple of photos that were taken using said lens, marketing the phone in the usual "Nothing" style.</p><p>That said, while the London-based company was dropping crumbs, a new leak pretty much showed us what the entire cake looked like. The leak suggests that Nothing Phone 3 will have three 50MP cameras, and that the camera placement on the Nothing Phone 3 will be unique. The top camera is off to the side, and the other two lenses are placed at the bottom next to each other.</p><p>The phone may have a 6.7-inch OLED display and be available in black and white colors. As for the device's battery, it is rumored to have a massive 5,150mAh capacity, and the glyph matrix interface on the rear panel.</p><p>The launch will take place on July 1.</p><h2 id="google-s-xr-glasses-might-have-a-unique-name-2">Google's XR Glasses might have a unique name</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/googles-android-xr-glasses-are-reportedly-code-named-google-martha"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google's XR Glasses were the talk of the town after their appearance at Google I/O this year.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Govee showed off plenty of cool devices at the start of the year, and they're now starting to become available. The new table lamp in particular is interesting; it has the usual lighting effects and high degree of customizability that you get with any Govee lighting product, and it also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker.</p><p>Govee collaborated with JBL over the product, and its official name signifies the same: Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL. I'm just going to call it the Table Lamp 2 Pro, and it certainly ticks all the right boxes: it houses 210 RGB LEDs that can be easily controller by your phone, and there's a 2.5-inch JBL full-range driver that sounds good in its own right.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LevLrEN47Wenas7htKvKw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LevLrEN47Wenas7htKvKw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also get a 5,200mAh battery, making the table lamp inherently portable. It is on the bulkier side, but the addition of a battery makes it that much more versatile. The Table Lamp 2 Pro<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Music-Light-Matter-Customized-Living/dp/B0F3D8RB4H"> retails for $179</a>, and you can get two units and set up a stereo pair if you're interested.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CSTiHxQzTyDRCctJbEJpw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSTiHxQzTyDRCctJbEJpw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's clearly a lot going on here, so let's start with the design. The table lamp has an acrylic shell that diffuses light evenly, and the bottom quarter has a clear finish that accentuates the design. You get a set of controls at the top that let you power the device on or off, switch between lighting modes, and change the music playback and volume of the built-in speaker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The speaker grille is also located up top, and it's easy enough to connect the table lamp to your phone if you just want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker. On that note, the sound quality is quite good; you get a good mid-range and decent treble, but it misses out on low-end energy — it just doesn't deliver the kind of rumble and vibrancy that you normally get on most portable speakers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's some mid-bass, but you don't get any sub-bass extension. This is likely to do with the design as there isn't much room to house the acoustic cavity, so if you want a Bluetooth speaker that has engaging bass, this isn't the best choice. Thankfully, there's no distortion when you increase the volume, so that's good to see.

There's also the option to dynamically adjust lighting effects based on music that's currently playing, and the table lamp does quite well in this mode.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdBrTJ9wstaLRFH4NFhtw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdBrTJ9wstaLRFH4NFhtw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's extensive customizability when it comes to adjusting the lighting, but you don't get the same flexibility with the sound — there's no EQ or presets, and you don't have the ability to tailor the sound quality to your tastes. That said, other the weedy bass, there isn't much wrong with the audio in general.</p><p>I wasn't able to test the stereo sound feature as I got just the one unit of this table lamp, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want a device mostly for listening to music. Outside of that quibble, there are no downsides here; the LEDs get bright enough that I didn't have to set it to over 50% most of the time, and the diffused light is the highlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is rock-solid; you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker, and the lighting portion connects to your home network (over the 2.4GHz band). It has Matter integration, and it can be controlled by Google Assistant or Alexa. It has LAN control as well, so if you use Home Assistant, you can use the platform to control the device.</p><p>There's a 5,200mAh battery that lets you use the table lamp anywhere, and I'm hesitant to take this outdoors; it is good as a party speaker, but it doesn't quite have the rugged design that you get with most outdoor Bluetooth speakers. You get a set of lighting effects that have accompanying sounds, and I used it as an ambient light most of the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Vkd3eBAEimFxCAQwxnVQx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vkd3eBAEimFxCAQwxnVQx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, this is a table lamp that excels as a Bluetooth speaker, and the portability gives it a distinct advantage.

Do your research</h2><p>This one might be a bit obvious, but if you plan to make a major purchase during Prime Day, it&apos;s important to do a little research beforehand so you know what you&apos;re looking for. Simply shopping for "any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>" during the sale, for instance, could lead to buyer&apos;s remorse when you realize that you didn&apos;t read up on these devices before making a purchase. </p><p>Start by considering what&apos;s important to <em>you </em>personally when you use your devices. Do you just need something simple and affordable? Maybe great cameras or battery life? What about AI features or long software support? Reading up on the best Android tech beforehand is a great way to make sure you&apos;re prepared when the big sale goes live. </p><p>Start shopping on July 8th with a wish list of the items you&apos;re interested in. That&apos;ll keep you from feeling overwhelmed and ensure you feel confident in your purchase once that order confirmation page appears. After all, tech can be expensive, and every penny counts these days. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-2-look-at-price-history"><span>Tip #2: Look at price history</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-look-at-price-history-2">2. Look at price history</h2><p>When these major sale events go live, it can be hard to tell if a deal is actually good or if the retailer is just trying to make you <em>think</em> it&apos;s good. Items marked with text like "<em>Lightning Deal" </em>can make you feel a sense of urgency on a discount that isn&apos;t necessarily that special. This is where price tracking tools come in handy. </p><p>Websites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"><strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong></a> let you check the complete price history on items sold through Amazon. Pasting the product page URL into the site&apos;s search field will give you a timeline of every instance that the item has been discounted, plus it will tell if you the current discount is record-breaking or if we&apos;ve seen it before. This can be helpful if you&apos;re trying to decide between making a major purchase today or waiting a few more months to buy.</p><p>The problem with websites like Camelcamelcamel is that the data can be a bit unreliable if a product has a lot of different color variants or storage configurations. Information can also be disrupted if the item has too many third-party sellers. Still, I wouldn&apos;t make any purchase on Amazon without at least attempting to check the price history first. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-3-check-rival-sales"><span>Tip #3: Check rival sales</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3" name="prime-day-2023-amazon-ad-169.jpg" alt="Prime Day 2023 ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1092" height="615" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-check-rival-sales-2">3. Check rival sales</h2><p>Of course, whenever Amazon launches a Prime Day event, you can expect most of its competitors to launch rival sales around the same time. Many of these sales match or beat Amazon&apos;s prices, which can be great if you don&apos;t have a Prime membership and aren&apos;t interested in joining (even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>there&apos;s a 30-day trial</strong></a> that lets you shop the sale for free). </p><p>Before you buy an Android device from Amazon during Prime Day, see if Best Buy or Walmart is offering an equal or better deal. Don&apos;t forget to check for extra perks too. Buying a tablet from Amazon may get you the device alone, but purchasing the same tablet for the same price during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-takes-on-amazon-with-an-epic-sale-of-its-own-see-the-top-5-android-deals-that-actually-matter">Best Buy&apos;s sale</a> might also get you three free months of Apple Music or a free trial to Xbox Game Pass. </p><p>Retailers like Best Buy and Samsung may also offer enhanced trade-in credit during their respective sale events, which could land you some additional savings if you have an old or broken device lying around. Needless to say, we&apos;ll be covering all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">best Android deals</a> from across the web that week — regardless of the source — so you can always check with us if you&apos;re unsure about a discount.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-4-watch-out-for-scams"><span>Tip #4: Watch out for scams</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:627px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.09%;"><img id="oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF" name="amazon-scam-detail.png" alt="An example of a scam text sent by a phony USPS rep" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="627" height="220" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="4-watch-out-for-scams-2">4. Watch out for scams</h2><p>Although Prime Day presents itself as the perfect opportunity to find great deals this summer, it&apos;s also an opportunity for scammers to target your data and bank account. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-prime-day-scams-to-look-for">Reports of scams and phishing attempts</a> increase dramatically during the sale event, and it&apos;s easy to fall victim to these traps if you&apos;re not careful.</p><p>Watch out for emails or texts that are trying to compel you to click on a link concerning a recent purchase, especially if you haven&apos;t placed an order lately. These scammers will often try to impersonate Amazon representatives or mail providers and will send emails from suspicious sources like "amazonusa[.]shop" or "amazonindo[.]com". Other dishonest agents may attempt to contact you by phone. </p><p>Rule of thumb, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4YFYCCNUSENA23B"><strong>Amazon clearly expresses</strong></a> on its site, representatives <em>"will never send you an unsolicited message that asks you to provide sensitive personal information like your social insurance number, tax ID, bank account number, credit card information, ID questions like your mother&apos;s maiden name or your password".</em> </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-5-stay-calm"><span>Tip #5: Stay calm</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 5" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="5-stay-calm-2">5. Stay calm</h2><p>Last but not least, if you want to have a good time shopping this Prime Day, it&apos;s important to stay calm. Email newsletters, search engines, and even celebrities will be flooding the airwaves that week with breathless endorsements and recommendations for top products, and it&apos;s important to remember that it&apos;s <em>just a sale</em>. </p><p>Don&apos;t get carried away by a false sense of urgency and buy a bunch of items you don&apos;t need, and don&apos;t get so overwhelmed by the flood of information that you end up missing a truly great deal. By simply researching products beforehand and preparing a list of everything you need in advance, you can wake up on the morning of July 8th and shop for deals at your leisure. </p><p>And don&apos;t forget: the entire Android Central staff (including yours truly) will be around to share our favorite deals and provide helpful shopping advice during the sale, so you&apos;ll never feel too lost. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th-11th: see best early deals and FAQ</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The splash page detailed a "Try a lock screen clock that fits to your photos" feature addition. When scrolling through the new additions in more detail, Samsung's video clip shows how the lock screen clock will morph around items in your chosen photo.</p><p>From the tipster's clip, the clock can recognize and shift around a person's head or other items in your photo for a more modern, artistic approach to your lock screen. In the beta, Samsung itself says this new clock function "works with people and animals."</p><p>This lock screen change grants the clock its own unique font when morphing. Depending on the angle or slant/curve in a photo, the clock will elongate or increase its size to fit perfectly alongside it. The publication also cites prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1938416143670382976">Ice Universe</a>, who spotted one important aspect: this stylistic change only works when the lock screen is fully active.</p><p>When using Samsung's AOD (always-on display), the morphing aspects of the clock remain neutral; however, when the lock screen is fully awakened, it will shift around the photo, as expected.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-has-a-lot-on-the-way-2">One UI 8 has a lot on the way</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New lock screen customization feature (One UI 8 BYFB) pic.twitter.com/vDuPitpec6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1938257024069865840">June 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>One UI 8 finally hit the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">at the end of May</a>. The initial beta packed a ton of upgrades to what users found in One UI 7. Already, the beta showcased improvements for the Now Bar and Now Brief, bringing more customized insights and suggests for daily tasks. Auracast is picking up audio connection via QR code scanning. Additionally, in One UI 8's beta, users can sync with multiple Auracast devices.</p><p>A couple of more apps like the Reminders app and the Calendar picked up updates, as well.</p><p>On a related note, Samsung's Gallery app was spotted with a new feature: "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-get-you-a-secret-vault-for-your-photos-in-one-ui-8">Private Album</a>."

Specifically, Google states it's addressing an prominent issue users have voiced in feedback reports about how "slow" Ask Photos is at returning results. However, this seems to be restricted to the AI's ability to fulfill queries about general/broad things like "beaches" and "dogs," per Google.</p><p>The update beginning to rollout this week should make Ask Photos a lot faster at returning answers, but the AI won't stop there.</p><p>Google says "You’ll now see results right away" when asking about broader topics you may have in your gallery. Gemini will keep working behind-the-scenes to "find the most relevant photos or information." From the post's example, it seems that Ask Photos will immediately fulfill your query with a grid view of images that correlate to your interest.</p><p>Above that will be a smooth Gemini animation of it looking through your photos before delivering the "Best Results" that it think matches your search.</p><h2 id="ask-gemini-photos-2">Ask (Gemini) Photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.73%;"><img id="hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj" name="google-photos-ask-photos-quicker-answers" alt="Google Photos is boosting Ask Photos with quicker response times for broad/simple queries, while Gemini works in the background for more a more detailed/specific response." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="537" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Joining this update is a wider rollout of Ask Photos in Google Photos. The brief patch notes states the feature is finally opening up "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">beyond early access</a>" to English-based users in the U.S. who are 18 and above.</p><p>The company's AI-based search in Google Photos started showing up last September when Labs made its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">early access waitlist available</a>. Throughout its testing, Gemini has remained at the center of the feature to help users discover content you have via your text query. Gemini was given the ability to understand queries based on people, food, and places but, as we've seen from reported user feedback, the AI can take a little longer than some would like.</p><p>Now, fulfilling these requests should come a lot faster for users just looking for a wide range of what they have.</p><p>Ask Photos also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ask-photos-ui-search-redesign-rollout">underwent a slight UI rework</a> earlier this year. Google cleaned up the chat interface, leading off with a "try asking" section full of suggested actions. It's also this UI that'll be flooded with your photos as Gemini tries to find what you're looking for, alongside its text reply of the content it found for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, creators younger than 16 (aged 13-15) will need to have an adult present during their streams.</p><p>YouTube states that an adult is not "visibly present;" not only will your chat be disabled, but "other features," as well.</p><p>The post explains there are plans to expand on these violations, with YouTube stating, "...in the future, we plan to take down these live streams and the account may temporarily lose its ability to live stream."</p><p>YouTube suggests young creators streaming with an adult can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9481328">give them channel access</a>. This can happen by granting them editor, manager, or owner privileges. There's also a set of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853834#:~:text=Live%20streaming%20best%20practices%20for%20minors">best streaming practices</a>" for minors to take (and for parents to check out) before going live.</p><h2 id="youtube-s-recent-developments-2">YouTube's recent developments</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube started testing a new, community-focused feature for live streams <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-is-testing-a-leaderboard-to-show-off-top-live-stream-fans">that brought a leaderboard</a> to fans. The test involved giving users a way to earn points in the following ways: chatting, Super Chats, and being active. Those who are (quite literally) doing the most were featured on a top 50 leaderboard. However, those who went even further, entering the top three, would receive a shiny badge to flex on everyone else.</p><p>Aside from streams, the company has started a test that'll run from June 26 to July 30, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-highlights-carousel-ai-overview-like-test-rollout">which is its own take on AI Overviews</a>. Available for Android and iOS devices, certain queries will display an AI-generated "Highlight." These will feature short video clips, each with an AI-created title and description about your query to give useful insights.</p><p>While it quite similar to Google Search's AI Overviews, YouTube's variant leans heavily on its clips, giving users the option to tap on them to view the full video.</p> ]]></dc:content>
