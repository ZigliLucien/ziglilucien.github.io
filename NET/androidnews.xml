                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Cheap tablets always see the light of day around holidays and season changes, and quite a few tablet deals are starting to go live for spring. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has launched 30% off the Google Pixel Tablet</strong></a> just days away from its Big Spring Sale (March 25th-31st). This deal represents $120 in savings, so it might not be a bad time to pick up your next Pixel device if you were already in the market.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel tablet</a> was highly anticipated upon its release in 2023, and it's remained a staple for those who like the Pixel ecosystem. While it's certainly not a premium tablet, the Pixel tablet upholds the cozy Google look and feel, offering decent performance backed by the Tensor G2 chip and 8GB of RAM. It also includes a 10.95-inch display, and while it's not an AMOLED screen, it still offers pretty bright, vibrant visuals.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="367f0391-f9cd-42a5-9b49-bcf573dea84b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="v4Gu23g5u59DsL4DguvyeQ" name="google-pixel-tablet-no-dock" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4Gu23g5u59DsL4DguvyeQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" data-dimension112="367f0391-f9cd-42a5-9b49-bcf573dea84b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$399.00</del> <strong>$279.00 for Amazon's Big Spring Sale</strong></a></p><p>Days before the big sale, Amazon is offering a $120 discount on the Google Pixel Tablet, which is a great option for those with other Pixel devices. With fluid performance and a vibrant 11-inch display, the Pixel tablet lives up to the hype as far as mid-range tablets go.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="367f0391-f9cd-42a5-9b49-bcf573dea84b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet 128GB:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you like Pixel devices and need a simple mid-range tablet; you're looking for a tablet that will offer regular software update support; you want another display for controlling Google smart home devices or for integrating with your other Pixel devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a tablet with a headphone jack; you prefer a tablet with smaller bezels or one with first-party accessories; you have extra money to spend and would rather upgrade to a premium productivity or work tablet.</p><p>No surprise here; the Google Pixel Tablet was a pretty easy pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets#section-best-for-pixel-fans">best Android tablet for Pixel fans </a>category. From the smooth, utilitarian One UI to the easy integration with other Pixel devices, there's more than one reason why fans waited so long for this tablet to come out.</p><p>To be sure, the Pixel Tablet isn't a premium-level tablet or one best used for performance-intensive use. However, it comes with a nice 10.95-inch LCD display that remains vibrant and bright (despite not being an AMOLED), and solid performance, as supported by the 8GB of RAM and Google Tensor G2 chip. This particular deal is for the 128GB storage configuration of the tablet, though Google also offers a 256GB version.</p><p>A few downsides include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Google's lack of a first-party stylus or keyboard cover. But for most casual users or those simply looking to add a multi-use screen to their Google smart home, the price point here is certainly worth considering.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>In the beginning, there was Palm. Or Windows. Or Nokia. Or BlackBerry. Anyway, then came Apple.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">iPhone</a> quickly became the industry standard for smartphones. Without offering any amazing new features, it captivated consumers in a way the existing offerings just couldn't. I spent far too much and chained myself to AT&T to get one, and there's a good chance you did, too.</p><p>This did not last. Someone at Google had the idea to try and make the smartphone more accessible to people who didn't want to or simply couldn't spend an arm and a leg with Android, and everything changed. Today, depending on the exact time of year, eight of every 10 new phones sold are powered by Android, but Apple makes more money than almost every other phone maker combined.</p>

<p>We're about to see this happen all over again with wearables. In fact, it has already begun. Last year wasn't a great year for wearable sales (or any other goods, it seems), but it was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-gains-as-apple-watch-declines-2024-global-smartwatch-shipments#viafoura-comments" target="_blank">particularly bad year for Apple</a>.</p><p>That doesn't mean Apple lost money, but it does mean the company saw its share of the market fall while competitor sales increased ever-so-slightly. Nor does it mean that Apple's watchOS and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> aren't a smashing success because the company surely made more pure profit for each watch sold than any other company could dream of doing.</p>
<p>Again, this is exactly what happened with the smartphone. Very few people bought the first Android phones. Then Motorola and HTC made some headway (with the help of U.S. carriers), and the gap narrowed until places were switched. Somehow, Apple still makes more money, even today, thanks to a supernatural manipulation of the supply chain and the idea that Android phones are for "poor" people in North America.</p><p>This is how wearables are going to play out, too. The Apple Watch is yet another product Apple makes obscene amounts of profit per unit because it's good at business, and people in the U.S., Canada, and a few enclaves around the world will rush out to buy another one the minute it's available. Basic math tells you selling 100 things and making $10 for every one of them is more than selling 200 things and only making $2 from each.</p>

<p>None of that matters to me, and none of it should matter to you. I want to love a wearable but have a hard time doing it, and when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">I do wear one</a>, it runs Garmin's <del>goofy</del> proprietary software, not Wear OS or watchOS. It's the one I like more than the others, and what you like is never going to matter to me. You need to do the very same thing and use whatever you like without caring what I think or which company makes more money.</p><p>It's also just the way both Apple and Google like it. One company wants numbers sold while the other wants profits per. Of course, Apple loved selling more watches than Samsung, but it loves the bottom line just as much.</p>
<p>This all weirdly makes sense. If you have 30 companies each selling a good product that people want, collectively, they will sell more than a single company that sells a similar, yet different, product. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a>, like Android, is a commodity like corn or crude oil that other companies use to create their own product. WatchOS is not and only available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a>. A company trying to do it alone will never be the market leader when it comes to sales.</p><p>As long as Apple can capture customers in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field#:~:text=Reality%20distortion%20field%20(RDF)%20is,new%20world%20through%20mental%20force." target="_blank">reality distortion field</a> and keep them buying expensive products and accessories to use with them, it will do just fine. Marketing is an incredible tool and Apple is the master at wielding it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Enjoy your smartwatch</a>, no matter who makes it.</p>

It grew mostly out of a desire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-should-release-another-ipod-touch">Apple to bring back the iPod Touch</a>, which it clearly has no interest in doing. I would frankly prefer <em>not </em>to commit to a whole-ass iPhone in order to get the iOS experience. However, if I must, then I would prefer not to spend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> amounts of money to do it, even if it’s the most intriguing device of the bunch.</p><p>So, I decided that I would wait for the iPhone 16e. At the time, I assumed it would fall under the iPhone SE moniker, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-iphone-se-is-tempting">the 2022 model was enticing as an iPod Touch replacement</a>, I figured I could hold out for the next model.</p><p>As the years went by, rumors would emerge about what the iPhone 16e would be. That included talk of an OLED display (finally) and a more modern design. Conflicting rumors went back and forth on whether it would have a notch or Dynamic Island, but it <em>seemed</em> like the iPhone 16e would be the cheap iPhone of my dreams.</p><p>And for a quick second, it was.

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> launched, I found myself quite perplexed and at odds over the choices Apple made.</p><p>Sure, it has an OLED display for richer blacks and better contrast, but the display is stuck at 60Hz. I don’t remember the last time I used a phone with that refresh rate, and I regularly review the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> from companies like Motorola, phones that easily cost half the price of the iPhone 16e. Even the $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> has a 120Hz OLED panel, which looks great, I might add.</p><p>Then, there’s the camera. Singular. The iPhone 16e has a single rear camera on the back, which is kind of unacceptable for a $600 phone. I’m not saying Apple should stick four cameras on the phone just for the sake of having multiple cameras, but the lack of even a secondary sensor is perplexing.</p><p>Nearly everything about the iPhone 16e was telling me not to buy it. Even Harish Jonnalagadda says in his iPhone 16e review that it's "a good phone, but a bad value right now." However, with it currently being the most affordable “new” iPhone that I can buy, I was close to pulling the trigger… that is, until the Pixel 9a launched.</p><p>The 9a pretty much affirmed my apprehensions: Apple doesn’t really know how to do value.</p>

<p>I’m not the biggest fan of Pixel phones, but I can’t deny that they’re some of the best phones you can buy. That’s why I wasn’t surprised to see that Google pretty much nailed the Pixel 9a. Based on the specs and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> from Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks, the phone feels like everything the iPhone 16e should’ve been.</p><p>The phone has a larger OLED display that’s more than 2x brighter and with a faster 120Hz refresh rate. It features a secondary 13MP camera for ultrawide shots, something (I learned from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>) I realized I can’t really go without.</p><p>You also get a faster USB standard on the Pixel, and while I can’t speak to battery life just yet, the 5,100mAh battery and 30+ estimation from Google sounds pretty good compared to the 4,005mAh unit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/">found in the iPhone 16e</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple has also been fumbling its AI rollout, delaying its long-awaited Siri upgrade. Meanwhile, Google has been going full-stream ahead with Gemini, to the point where it’s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">prepping to replace the tried-and-true Google Assistant</a> later this year. The Pixel 9a won’t have every feature from the Pixel 9, and not all AI features will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">processed on-device</a>, but Google’s software and AI are pretty solid, with plenty of fun features for Pixel 9a users to take advantage of.</p><p>I’ll also mention that you get more interesting color options with the Pixel, which is more than I can say for the rather bland black or white iPhone 16e.</p><p>This is all for a phone that costs $100 <em>less</em> than the iPhone 16e.</p>

<h2 id="the-iphone-16e-still-as-some-good-things-going-for-it-2">The iPhone 16e still as some good things going for it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s not to say the iPhone 16e doesn’t have some pretty compelling specs. The A18 chip is mighty impressive and is probably much more performant than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. And despite having just one camera, I've always been impressed with Apple's imaging, and it looks like it still takes great images and videos, even if you miss the option to take wider shots.</p><p>There’s no doubt Apple’s FaceID is a superior facial authentication method (although I do prefer fingerprint sensors), and the Action Button is a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">I would like to see on more phones</a>.</p><p>Aesthetically, the iPhone 16e just looks a lot better. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">new camera housing on the Pixel 9a</a> just looks awkward.</p><p>You also get more storage options with the iPhone 16e, going all the way up to 512GB. The downside is that it will obviously cost you much more, with the 128GB iPhone priced $100 higher than the 128GB Pixel 9a.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16a are both affordable ways to get hold of some of the latest hardware and software on both Android and iOS. If you’re already baked into one OS and holding onto a previous A-series Pixel or iPhone SE, then these may be worth upgrading to. They’re also good ways to bring in younger family members without breaking the bank on a new phone.</p><p>Harish says the iPhone 16e is aimed at "older iPhone users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware," and this could also be said for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>That said, it feels like the Pixel 9a is a much better deal, with mostly better specs and a lower price tag for someone looking to save money on a new phone. Even if you’re an iPhone user, if you don’t have any allegiance to iOS, this is a phone worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>As for me, maybe I’ll just wait until Apple releases an iPhone 17e or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/former-iphone-users-discuss-interest-in-apple-foldable">iPhone Flip</a>.</p>

While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.</p><p>For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. It also arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model (4700mAh). The device gets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, the new Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. It comes with an extended battery life of up to 30 hours, faster charging, and two new colorways: Iris and Peony. Starting at $499, it has a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera.</p><p>But what about Pre-orders, you ask? Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-does-the-right-thing-by-delaying-pixel-9a-pre-orders">but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a.</a> Google said in an email that the device will be going on sale sometime in April without an exact date of sale. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a "component quality issue" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: "We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices."</p>

Second, app developers who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers."

Folks in the U.S. have to wait for another three days post-launch, aka April 10,  to be able to see the update pop up on their devices.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_4396080460231991821&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fsamsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-7&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Fsamsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">announcement post</a>, the first set of devices that will be lucky enough to experience the OS are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. While other eligible devices will see a gradual rollout post-launch "in the coming weeks."</p>

Pebble's founder, Eric Migicovsky, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches" target="_blank">a new blog post</a> announced the arrival of two new smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, "Core Devices." Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with "thousands of your beloved Pebble apps."</p><p>Time 2 is a 1.5-inch e-paper display watch that will deliver "less glare and reflections" than its older watches. It has a  53% larger display with 88% more pixels,  the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices had given the watch an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker. The Time 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">available for pre-orders </a>for $225.</p><p>The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, which the company says is identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. This smartwatch features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display with a lightweight polycarbonate frame and three physical buttons. Like Time 2, Core Devices states it is "targeting" an IPX8 water-resistant rating. For $149, it includes a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.</p>

<p>Google Vids is a relatively new Google Workspace service that uses AI and Gemini to create videos and presentation from scratch. It's intended to be a more practical alternative to other video-generation tools, prioritizing work and school applications such as presentations, slideshows, and other types of content delivery methods. Now, Google is expanding Vids' AI capabilities with the ability to generate voiceovers, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com" target="_blank">announced</a> this week.</p><p>After creating a video with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">Google Vids</a>, the "Help me Create" feature made it possible to generate a voiceover script with AI. The latest update takes things a step further, using AI to narrate the previously-generated script. Google notes the following as benefits to using Help me Create to make AI voiceovers:</p>
<ul><li>"Eliminate the manual effort of recording 'the perfect take'"</li><li>"Gain easy access to a variety of voiceovers that provide you with professional-sounding video narration"</li><li>"Save time matching voiceovers to scenes in your video with automatic audio to scene alignment"</li></ul>

<p>After generating a sample script and AI voiceover, you can edit the script and voiceover with ease, so you aren't locked into one generation. There are different tone and pitch options to choose from, as well as unique voices. The script and voiceover options will only appear through Help me Create after opening or creating a Google Vids project.</p><p>The feature is only available to paid Google Workspace customers on the following plans:</p>
<ul><li>Business Standard and Plus</li><li>Enterprise Standard and Plus</li><li>Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus</li><li>Education Plus</li><li>Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education or Education Premium add-ons</li></ul>
<p>AI-generated voiceovers are rolling out now in Google Vids, but it could take 15 days from the feature's initial release (March 20) for the functionality to appear for everyone.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is the first to support Instant Hotspot.</li><li>Google's Instant Hotspot feature is part of Cross-device Services, a set of features designed to make Android devices work together.</li><li>Older Samsung phones could only use the Auto Hotspot feature, exclusive to Galaxy phones and tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on building up the Android platform into a true ecosystem of devices that work better together, including Android phones, Android tablets, and Wear OS watches. Part of that effort involves Cross-device Services, a set of Android features that help multiple devices seamlessly connect. However, the point is moot if Android manufacturers don't buy in, and historically Samsung Galaxy devices prioritize their own ecosystem features rather than the broader Google ones.</p><p>That was the case with hotspot tethering, as Samsung phones supported an Auto Hotspot feature that automatically connected with Samsung tablets. Now, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, Google's Instant Hotspot feature is supported for the first team. Leveraging Android's Cross-device Services, this means that Samsung Galaxy phones can instantly tether their hotspot to any Android tablet.</p><p>The move was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-instant-hotspot-3537161/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which noticed the new toggle appear in the Settings app on the Galaxy S25 series. To use it, navigate to the <strong>Cross-device Services </strong>tab in Settings, tap <strong>Internet Sharing</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Instant Hotspot </strong>toggle is flipped on. After that, Instant Hotspot will work with Android tablets and Chromebooks that are signed into the same Google account as your Galaxy S25.</p>

<ul><li>A leak on X claims Motorola is looking to deliver a wooden finish for its Razr Plus 2025.</li><li>The leaked rendering doesn't give enough details about the authenticity of the device's proposed wood finish.</li><li>The Moto X was a truly unique phone with a real wood finish, which Motorola similarly for the Edge 50 Ultra in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new design leak for Motorola's upcoming foldable surfaced and shows off a unique aesthetic choice.</p><p>The latest leak concerns the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 as a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1902755397183635565">Evan Blass on X</a> showcased a rendering of a potential design choice for consumers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/21/wood-backed-motorola-razr-60-ultra-surfaces-in-leaked-video/">9to5Google</a>). Curiously, all the tipster says is "Ultra" in the post, which likely refers to its international name, the Razr 60 Ultra. Meanwhile, what the rendering shows off is a wooden finish for the back of the upcoming Razr Plus. It's a lighter wood with the Motorola "M" symbol in its center and the Razr name right beneath it.</p><p>There are some uncertainties about this finish, most notably about its authenticity. From the rendering video, it's not clear if Motorola is leaning toward <em>real </em>wood or if this is a type of faux wood. As the publication also notes, the rendering shows the rear panel as glossy. That doesn't exactly scream real wood unless Motorola is giving the next Razr Plus the same polishing treatment you would give flooring in your home.</p><p>That could just be for a more interesting viewing experience or it could truly reflect the nature of the panel. The tipster also gave a few brief looks at three more color options for the Razr Plus this year.</p>

<p>If this leak is accurate, it wouldn't be the first time Motorola dropped such an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">unconventional finish</a> like wood before. Over a decade ago, the company dropped the Moto X, which provided consumers with the choice of several wood grains for its rear panel.</p><p>Since then, Motorola has provided wood backing on devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-april-20-2024#:~:text=Motorola%27s%20new%20flagship%20is%20made%20from%20wood">the Edge 50 Ultra from 2024</a>. The company dropped three phones, each with a unique set of finishes that broke the norm. Consumers could purchase them with either a wood grain back or a vegan leather finish.</p><p>There's a chance Motorola could chase a similar theme this year as a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look">leaked Razr Plus 2025 renders</a> showcased it with a faux leather back. Aside from that, the device looked relatively similar to what we've gotten these past couple of years. It seems Motorola could continue to provide a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen. Other rumors claim the OEM could finally step up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-charging-adapter-strength-database">wired charging game</a> and give the Razr Plus 2025 68W wired charging support.</p><p>More importantly, there's speculation that the foldable could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">launch sooner</a> this year, potentially in April.</p>

<ul><li>Epic is offering weekly free games for Android users through the Epic Games Store on mobile.</li><li>The company also added nine more titles to the Epic Games Store for Android in the last month.</li><li>Currently, users can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist for free until March 27.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic brought its popular PC game marketplace, the Epic Games Store, to mobile, and it's bringing the famous free games program to iOS and Android too. The company first announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">monthly free games for the Epic Games Store</a> on mobile starting in January 2025. Now, there are weekly free games available on iOS and Android starting today, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/super-meat-boy-forever-eastern-exorcist-for-free-on-epic-games-store-on-mobile" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>User can download Super Meat Boy Forever and Eastern Exorcist from the Epic Games Store on those platforms until March 27, free of charge. Those titles join the Epic-made free titles that are always available, like Fortnite and Rocket League. In the past, Epic offered games such as Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, but that offer expired last month.</p><p>To install the Epic Games Store on Android, you'll need to sideload it onto your device. That means navigating to Epic's website, downloading the APK, and completing the installation process. In all, the company says it takes 12 steps for an Android user to download and run the Epic Games Store. It's a lot different than using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-off-samsung-galaxy-store-notifications">Samsung Galaxy Store</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A" name="Epic-Games-Store-Mobile-Update" alt="A graphic for the Epic Games Store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMZRSpnnsvaDe8H7WhB49A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, it may be worth it, especially if you like free Android games. Plus, the Epic Games Store continues to add more games and features as it builds up its game marketplace. Earlier this year, Epic added a few essential desktop features to the mobile version — persistent account login across games and auto-functionality.</p><p>Additionally, the company added nine games to the Epic Games Store for Android in the past month:</p>
<ul><li>Bowling Clash</li><li>Endling - Extinction is Forever</li><li>Chicken Police - Paint it RED</li><li>One Hand Clapping</li><li>Neighbours back From Hell</li><li>This is The Police</li><li>This is The Police 2</li><li>This Is The President</li><li>Through the Darkest of Times</li></ul>
<p>Time will tell if free games will be enough to sway Android users away from the Google Play Store, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">because Google's option isn't perfect</a>. For now, users can expect at least one free game each week on the Epic Games Store for Android.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly started developing a new "Parallel Module Loading" change in Android that will affect the Pixel 10.</li><li>An Open Source Project post shows this "loading process" change will reduce the Pixel 10's loading time by 30%.</li><li>Previous Pixel 10 rumors mention Google's Pixie AI assistant, as well as a gallery of leaked renderings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted making a software change that could positively impact the performance of the next flagship Pixel.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-10-startup-performance-3537302/">Android Authority</a>), Google recently brought attention to an Android Open Source Project change tested for a couple of devices. The source code change is called "Parallel Module Loading." Aside from the technical jargon, the root of the change reads "Pixel 10 reduces 30% loading time."</p><p>Testing was also reportedly conducted on Google's Pixel Fold, in which it resulted in a 25% overall reduction.</p><p>Rahman adds that a 30% reduction in loading time will likely affect the phone's startup performance — notably its loading time. Specifically, they state this software upgrade will impact the "early part of the Android OS’s multi-stage initialization process." With a quicker process taking place, it <em>seems </em>that Google will make its next flagship models (and the Fold) load faster. However, Rahman notes that it's unclear if this change will quicken its overall startup.</p><p>Given the fact that this test showed up recently in March, there's speculation that Google could see this as a perfect addition to a future Android 16 update.</p>

<p>Rumors about the Pixel 10 are just getting started as one from earlier in March speculated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">about a new AI assistant</a>. Internal sources claim Google will debut "Pixie," a new Pixe-exclusive assistant in the next flagship series. This AI will be popped into an app that will bring cross-communication capabilities between a user's downloaded apps. Pixie will also process a user's metadata to "predict" actions for them.</p><p>Google reportedly confirmed, "It will also be able to suggest places, products, and names, right when you need them."</p><p>Something more to chew on surfaced ten days ago: a small gallery of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">alleged Pixel 10 renderings</a>. From what a tipster highlighted, it seems Google isn't preparing to introduce a vast amount of hardware changes — if any at all — for the Pixel 10 series. The leak showcased three devices: the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The trio's images sported the exact same design with rounded corners and flat edges as the Pixel 19 series we have today.</p><p>However, one major assumption is that the base Pixel 10 could grab an additional lens, taking it up from a dual array to a triple.</p>

<p>I'm what some would call a "specs snob." Meaning that I want the latest, greatest, and most powerful device that I can get my hands on. After years of reviewing phones and devices that nobody should use but everyone bought, I (mostly) decided that enough was enough. It also doesn't help that around the time I made that personal decision, I got my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 2.</p><p>So when I saw that Google announced the Pixel 9a, I just read the headlines and just kept it moving. It wasn't until I read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">excellent hands-on</a> from Android Central's very own Michael Hicks that I started to look a bit deeper into what the 9a had to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-cameras" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right), the 8a slightly overlapping the 9a corner. The photo focuses on the 9a's new camera cutout compared to the 8a's camera bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get this out of the way, I don't like Google's decision to remove the camera bar. It's been a staple of the Pixel lineup since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and while I haven't said this out loud, I was also disappointed when it was removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Now, colors notwithstanding, the Pixel 9a just blends in with the sea of rectangles that everyone uses.</p><p>Anyways, on paper, the Pixel 9a is practically the perfect phone for the majority of people. Do you need an all-day battery life? The 9a delivers a 5,100mAh battery, paired with a larger vapor chamber for better cooling, which, in turn, should mean the Tensor G4 has a bit more room to breathe. Oh, and by the way, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">Google claims</a> these two changes are the reasons why the camera bar was sliced off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of performance, the Tensor G4 is in the cockpit, with 8GB of LPDDR5X riding shotgun. That sounds great, right? Actually, yeah, I think it sounds pretty darn good. What's that? You don't get Pixel Screenshots or Call Notes? Oh well.</p><p>Apparently, this is because Google is using an "extra extra small" Gemini Nano model. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a>, Google confirmed that this model has other limitations, such as "the lack of multimodality—Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS is <em>text-only</em>."</p><p>Normally, I would put on my Jerry hat and be irritated that Google didn't figure out a way to include features that should be staples across the entire lineup. So why am I sitting here feeling the complete opposite?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g" name="pixel-9-ai.jpg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuHipTSvRxGqb5ycFmBX9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because this is the exact problem that Google needed to solve.</p><p>Flashback to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> release, and you would have a hard time convincing me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> was actually the better phone. With the exception of the camera hardware and camera features, the Pixel 8a offered practically the same experience while costing $200 less.</p><p>With the Pixel 9a, there are quite a few differences, but Google managed to drop the less important features while providing some sound reasoning as to why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1910px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="PzyV7AF5XzsSxQG8R5xyoQ" name="google-pixel-9a-mockup" alt="Google Pixel 9a mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzyV7AF5XzsSxQG8R5xyoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1910" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a still lets you enjoy the fruits of Gemini's labor, but it just might not be as fast and can't handle anything other than text. It's not equipped with the best camera that Google offers, but the 48MP main lens still sounds pretty darn good, and you aren't losing out on Google's image processing.</p><p>Sure, it has a larger screen and bigger battery than its brethren, but the camera bar is gone, and the bezels are massive. On top of that, the Pixel 9 features an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-just-dont-work-for-me">some would argue</a> that an optical sensor is better anyway. Personally, I just think Google needs to embed it in the power button, but what do I know?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, instead of getting 95% of what the more expensive version has, you get something closer to 85% or maybe 90%. All while paying $200 less and coming in a dollar short of the $500 imaginary line in the sand.</p><p>But what about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a>? Yeah? What about it? Apple might have beaten both Google and Samsung to the punch with a new mid-range phone, but the iPhone 16e also costs $100 more and falls short in a lot of ways.</p><p>If you don't believe me, just check this out:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, today Google launched the Pixel 9a, and it continues to show how much of an embarrassment the iPhone 16e is.Here’s everything the Pixel 9a has over the iPhone 16e, despite being $100 cheaper:– Blue and pink color choices– 6.3” display vs 6.1”– 120 Hz vs 60 Hz– 2,700… pic.twitter.com/Vj75GqF1JV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902396486018580494">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Which reminds me, if you're feeling sour or betrayed by Google leaving out some Gemini features, just remember that Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/">can't even tell you what month it is</a>. No, I'm not kidding.</p><p>For years, if someone asked me to recommend the best phone for $500, I'd probably have told them to either wait for a deal or just get an iPhone. Even if that meant getting the last-gen iPhone SE, which still had the physical home button. That's no longer the case, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple continues to stumble</a> and fall harder and harder while Google keeps mosying on along. As such, if you asked me that same question today, I'd tell you to quit talking to me and pre-order one already.</p><p>There's just something about the Pixel 9a that feels comfortable, and that's coming from someone who hasn't actually used one yet. Not only that, but the Pixel 9a might be the first Android phone that I would feel good about giving to an older family member. The peace of mind of being able to hand someone a phone and absolve yourself from being the dedicated tech support rep makes the Pixel 9a worth every penny and probably more.</p>

<ul><li>A report "confirms" the Google Pixel 9a features a "limited" version of AI called Gemini Nano XXS.</li><li>The Pixel 9a only features 8GB of RAM, which isn't enough to support the bulk of Google's larger, fancier AI features, thus the even smaller version of Gemini.</li><li>During its launch, Google said the Pixel 9a supports Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest Pixel is more affordable and, according to recent reports, it features a less powerful version of the company's AI, too.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Ars Technica</a> confirms Google's Pixel 9a runs a much smaller, less resource-chasing version of its AI called "Gemini Nano XXS" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9a-gemini-not-powerful-rest-of-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). The publication states this "limited" version of Gemini Nano takes center stage because of the Pixel 9a's low amount of available RAM: only 8GB. As a result, research shows the Pixel 9a doesn't contain <em>all </em>of the AI features Pixel consumers might've become accustomed to/seen with the recent Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The post says the device doesn't sport features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a>. Additionally, it notes "Google doesn't call out missing features on the product page," meaning more testing is required to know the full extent of the missing Gemini features the Pixel 9a lacks.</p><p>These two prominent features are missing from the Pixel 9a because of the audio and video processing functions required. The publication says Gemini Nano XXS simply can't do what's required to run these two AI features, so they've been left out.</p><p>The Pixel 9a still has some useful AI features like Recorder app text summaries. Due to its low available RAM (a resource heavily sought after for on-device AI), the Gemini Nano XXS model is said to "only load when the model is needed." As a result, users may notice some other functions become a little less reliable when calling on Gemini for AI assistance. If the model ran continuously in the background users likely wouldn't have the capability of doing much — at least not well.</p>

<p>Speaking of its supported AI features, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">the Pixel 9a launched</a> earlier this week, Google highlighted a few of them. The company stated the device contains features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, "and more." Considering the last three choices, these all revolve around photography. If Gemini Nano XXS only surfaces "when needed," those features would fit the bill.</p><p>A few other features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Call Assist were also mentioned.</p><p>Google likely had to make some changes to ensure the Pixel 9a would remain in the "budget realm," kind of like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">past-gen modem</a>. The company recently confirmed that the Pixel 9a utilizes the older Exynos 5300 modem, which lacks satellite connectivity support. Moreover, the modem is overall less powerful compared to the newer Exynos 5400 inside the other Pixel 9 series phones (with satellite connectivity).</p><p>There's some additional concern about this choice considering, in 2023, the Exynos 5300 was popped into the Pixel 8 series, which gave users quite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">mobile data headache</a>. Not only was their reception questionable, but the modem seemingly affected the series' battery as users saw severe draining issues.</p>

The aluminum design, page turn buttons, and high-quality E Ink panel made it a standout choice, but annoyingly, Amazon doesn't sell the product any longer, and there isn't a viable alternative — the brand is instead focusing on note-taking devices like the Scribe. <br><br>This was problematic as the battery life of my Kindle Oasis isn't anywhere close to what it used to be; I still get a few days out of a charge, but I couldn't reliably use it on the road. As I started heading back to events, I wanted another e-reader that was up to the task, and that's where I came across the Kobo Libra Colour. <br><br>Kobo's latest e-reader nails the basics; it has a 7-inch E Ink panel, adjustable warm light, and physical page turn buttons — all the features that made me like the Kindle Oasis. As a bonus, the e-reader has USB-C connectivity, and Libby/Overdrive integration. <br><br>I switched to the Libra Colour at the start of the year, and after three months of extensive use involving travel to three countries and reading over a dozen books, I'm convinced — this is the ideal upgrade to the Kindle Oasis.</p>

<p>Kobo unveiled the Libra Colour in April 2024, and the e-reader is available globally. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z">costs $229 on Amazon</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-colour">Rakuten store</a>, and you can get your hands on the e-reader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof-White/dp/B0CZXWGK79">in the U.K. for £209</a>. It debuted in India back in October 2024, and is available in the country for ₹19,999 ($231).</p>

<p>Kobo did a good job with the design of the Libra Colour, and it feels great to hold and use. Just like the Kindle Oasis, the Libra Colour has physical page turn buttons, but they're on the left. There's a raised edge on the left that makes it easier to hold the e-reader, and the back is flat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kw3tUjtTPKmdphK964o8KT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Oasis, the Libra Colour has a plastic back, and while it doesn't quite have the same premium feel, there are no issues with the build quality. Coming in at 199g, the Libra Colour is 11g heavier than the Oasis, but the difference isn't noticeable in daily use. And while it has a plastic back, there is an interesting floral motif at the back that makes holding the device just that little easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJMHYpiCbsm85vF74hhGBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The raised edge houses the USB-C port, and it's great to be able to use an e-reader that uses the same charging port as my phone. This was a constant source of frustration with the Kindle Oasis, and Amazon really should have introduced a model with USB-C connectivity. Thankfully, that isn't an issue on the Libra Colour.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWv7T3LWRJY7AezX7cUxCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the white color variant of the e-reader, and it looks a little more distinctive than the standard black model. The e-reader has built-in sensors that change the orientation of the screen according to whatever hand you're holding it in, and the location of the page turn buttons is ideal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43crX43JatRGpTr3We3EeS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The buttons are easily accessible with your thumb, and have good tactility. If anything, the buttons proved to be a bit too stiff in the beginning, but they're better to use now. Having physical buttons makes all the difference on an e-reader, and I can't go back to using one without it. A cool feature is the ability to invert the buttons; by default, the bottom button is used to go to the next page in a book, but you can easily switch it to the top button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGTostjKV9P5F8c3U5JVjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one issue I have with the design is the power button; it's located at the back, and it's inconvenient to access most of the time. Thankfully, pressing the page turn buttons wakes the device, so that's what I've been doing. While it isn't a problem as such, I don't like that the panel doesn't sit flush with the body; this is another area where the Oasis wins out. <br><br>Outside of that though, I can't find anything to fault with the Libra Colour. It may not have quite the same in-hand feel as the Oasis, but it is just as reliable in daily use, and it holds up incredibly well during travel.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LAho9TjLddxcPeRnyFybjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining feature on the Libra Colour is the 7-inch panel, and unlike every other e-reader I used until now, it does a great job rendering colors. It's made possible by use of E Ink's Kaleido 3 panel, and it has good color saturation thanks to 4,096 colors. The resolution of the panel is 1680 x 1264, with a pixel density of 300PPI — just like the Kindle Oasis — with monochrome text and 140PPI when it comes to content in color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YVgBf8CWQ4jmBeNn9BPMiS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YVgBf8CWQ4jmBeNn9BPMiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's enjoyable to use an e-reader with a color panel, and it's a technical achievement in and of itself. Because of the way E Ink panels work, there's no backlight powering the display, and it's instead illuminated by LEDs on the side. While this isn't an issue with black and white text — it looks just as clean as other e-readers — it is noticeable when viewing things like comics and book covers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDgzsS9TxMn2d3JNPGG7JT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a noticeable grain to the colors, and because of the inherent nature of E Ink, you don't get the same color vibrancy as LCD or OLED panels — that's just the way the tech works. So if you're looking to get the Libra Colour to read comics, know that it still does a decent job in this area as it integrates the CBZ and CBR extensions, but color quality won't be anywhere as good as an Android tablet like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hPNFKNLTXDPWAgAViBPGiS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hPNFKNLTXDPWAgAViBPGiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The E Ink panel by itself does a good job curbing blue light emissions, and I had no problems using the Libra Colour all day. It uses Kobo's ComfortLight Pro tech, so you get adjustable warm light in addition to the regular white LED lighting, and it definitely makes a difference — particularly when reading at night. On that note, there's dark mode as well, and while I use the mode extensively on my monitor and phones, I prefer reading books without it. <br><br>Basically, this is one of the best panels you can get today, and it makes using the Libra Colour that much more engaging.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-kobo-libra-colour-real-world-usage"><span>Kobo Libra Colour: Real-world usage</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gFDkdD6J4bfRwj6uqSJHDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is a delight to use; it's comfortable to hold throughout the day, and the 7-inch panel size is ideal to read books. The E Ink panel itself is terrific, with good pixel density and clarity. I didn't see any issues with ghosting — where afterimages of previous pages are retained when you refresh — and the interface is just as fluid as the Kindle Oasis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ga7uUAJjzBFmGSgMUkwemS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with navigation, and page turns are handled smoothly while reading a book. Obviously, a big draw is the physical page turn buttons, and they make using the Libra Colour that much more enjoyable. While I didn't use it to read comics, it's fun to be able to view book covers in color, and that novelty doesn't go away. What I also like is that the device lets you put the cover on the lock screen when it's idling, and that's a nice addition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMs2oKfTHUxhBwJjRZ9aET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Libra Colour is available in a single configuration with 32GB of storage, and considering most ebooks are less than 1MB in size, the storage isn't a problem with sizable collections. It isn't an issue even if you want to read comics on the device, and while the color panel doesn't have the best resolution, it is a decent choice in this regard. Similarly, you can listen to audiobooks by connecting a Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>The e-reader has a 2050mAh battery, and in my usage, it easily lasted two weeks between charges. That's less than what I got with the Kindle Oasis (back when it's battery didn't degrade), but the color E Ink panel needs more power, and the convenience of charging over USB-C more than offsets any issues around battery longevity. Charging the e-reader takes over an hour and a half as it is limited to 10W, and it didn't exceed 7W when connected to a standard 100W USB PD charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFXFU47gWmiuXquUfkKRgS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the software is the customizability. There's integration with cloud storage providers, so you can easily download books from Google Drive if that's what you prefer. You can also easily load custom fonts on the device, and the built-in selection in itself is extensive. I've gotten used to Amazon's Bookerly font over the last decade, and it was a breeze to install it on the e-reader. <br><br>You can also easily annotate and highlight books, and this is particularly handy thanks to the color E Ink panel. There's also the ability to journal and take notes, but you'll need to pick up the Kobo Stylus to do that. I have a dozen styli in the house, but none of those — even the ones paired with Onyx and Remarkable readers — connected to the Libra Colour, so I wasn't able to test this feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rw5Y5WcaWTMbhX7yPHMAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's IPX8 ingress protection, and you can use the Libra Colour in the tub or at the pool without any issues. Finally, if you use Libby, you can get the books onto the Libra Colour and read without too much of a hassle, and that's another area where the e-reader wins out against the Kindle Oasis. <br><br>In general, the Libra Colour does a better job with DRM-free e-books than any of Amazon's e-readers, and it's refreshing to see. Kobo's ebook store isn't anywhere as extensive as the Kindle Store, but you can easily grab books from any storefront and read on the Libra Colour as it has native EPUB, EPUB3, FlePub, PDF, and MOBI integration.</p>

<p>As good as the Kindle Oasis has been, it's clear that Amazon has no intention of delivering a successor to the product. Thankfully, there are other alternatives around; I like what Onyx is doing with its e-readers, and the BOOX Go Color 7 is a decent choice. <br><br>It has the same E Ink Kaleido 3 panel as the Libra Colour, adjustable warm light, and higher 64GB of storage. You get physical page turn buttons as well, and although I didn't test the product, I'm keen on seeing whether Onyx was able to resolve the ghosting issues that's prevalent on its other devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="apizd9EXLoKvpWXaWZxzcS" name="Kobo Libra Colour" alt="Kobo Libra Colour review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apizd9EXLoKvpWXaWZxzcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an e-reader with a color panel</li><li>You want physical page turning buttons</li><li>You need a good design that's built to last</li><li>You want great battery life</li><li>You need customization-friendly software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an extensive built-in ebook store</li><li>You want a metallic chassis</li></ul>
<p>The Libra Colour delivers everything I need in an e-reader in 2025. The design isn't too heavy, and the white model looks quite elegant. Kobo did a great job with the weight distribution, and I didn't see any issues even after using the e-reader all day. The page turn buttons take a while to get used to as they're stiff out of the box, but once you've gotten acclimated to the e-reader, this isn't an issue. <br><br>The E Ink panel is delightful; text is clear and detailed with no ghosting, and there's extensive customizability when it comes to font selection. The icing on the cake is the color panel, and it's fun to view book covers and illustrations as intended. The warm light makes it easier to use the e-reader at night, and with Bluetooth, USB-C connectivity, and IPX8 ingress protection, Kobo nailed the basics. <br><br>The software is great to use, and there's no lag when navigating the interface or turning pages in a book. Battery life isn't quite as good as the Kindle Oasis, but you'll still only need to charge the device biweekly on average. Ultimately, the Libra Colour is the best e-reader to upgrade to if you're still on the Kindle Oasis.</p>

<p>The SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card made its debut at IFA 2024. Initially, I had dismissed it as your everyday run-of-the-mill Bluetooth tracker. Don't make the same mistake I made at first because there's more to this wallet-finding tracker.</p><p>SwitchBot is a brand dedicated to smartening up the dumb things in your home and integrating them all together to create a cohesive ecosystem. I have used many of the brand's smart home accessories over the years and they never disappoint, both in terms of quality and price.</p><p>The company makes everything IoT, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-locks">smart locks</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-hub-2-review">hubs</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/switchbot-universal-remote">universal remotes</a> and hygrometers. Once you set up your smart home system via the SwitchBot app and every item can communicate with each other, that's when the magic happens.</p><p>Here's how well the amicably priced SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card held up in my testing.</p>

<p>There are plenty of unique aspects of the slim and trim SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card. But first, let's evaluate its functionality as a regular old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth tracker</a>, as this is its primary purpose.</p><p>Like any Bluetooth tracking device worth its salt, the Wallet Finder Card can be tracked via an app on your phone. There's no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Google Find My Device</a> support, so for now, you can only use Apple's Find My network on iOS. Android users can still use the tracker using the SwitchBot app for Android.</p><p>You can save the Wallet Finder Card under the name of your choice within the app, which is also where you can track the card. You can also use the card to find your phone by clicking the button twice. It has a physical QR code sticker on the back as a failsafe when it gets lost. Anyone can scan it and alert you of its location. SwitchBot also has anti-tracking measures in place for the safety of the public.</p>

<p>The speaker on the tracker rings nice and loud at 78dB, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile Slim that I reviewed</a> a while back. Notably, the newer Tile Slim has a louder 104dB volume. Just like the best Tile trackers, you get robust IP67 water and dust-proofing on the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card. When I put the two cards next to each other, the SwitchBot one was noticeably lighter and thinner.</p><p>Compared to the latest Tile by Life360 Slim (2024)'s 350ft range, the Switchbot tracker's 300ft Bluetooth range is still not bad at all. Considering the previous-gen Tile Slim had a 250ft range, and this is SwitchBot's first tracker, that's impressive.</p><p>Finally, there's no replaceable battery on the Wallet Finder Card, but you get three years of battery life. As a Bluetooth tracker alone, it's an excellent product that delivers value for money.</p>

<p>On to the unconventional aspects. The SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card has two very unusual features. The first is that it has NFC support.</p><p>Why would you even need NFC on a Bluetooth tracker? Well, SwitchBot added a nifty integration with its smart locks, so you can tap the Wallet Finder Card on a SwitchBot Lock and use it to unlock your door.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="H9cG7Qomx4GRRvSm6jSeMD" name="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" alt="SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9cG7Qomx4GRRvSm6jSeMD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4320" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second unique and most enticing feature of the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card is smart home integration. There are two main automations that are specific to the tracking card within the SwitchBot app: Return Home and Leave Home.</p><p>For example, you could set an automation where as soon as your Wallet Finder Card enters within range of the hub at home, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> like air conditioner and lights in your house turn on.</p><p>This option requires you to have a SwitchBot hub, but the final result is well worth the extra buy. Since the SwitchBot hub comes with an IR blaster built-in, you can "teach" it to learn commands to operate non-smart devices in your home as well. This, along with your Wallet Finder Card, can be used to make incredibly intelligent routines within the SwitchBot app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The sky's the limit with these smart home automations.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And if you get the Matter-enabled Hub 2, it gets even better. You could interconnect devices that support Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Google Assistant, and other smart home ecosystems to create a single unified smart home setup.</p><p>Since the Hub 2 can interact with smart and dumb electronics via IR, the possibilities are limitless. You could pre-soak a one-pot rice dish in your smart cooker and integrate that into your Return Home routine. If you have the SwitchBot Curtain Opener, you could instruct your Leave Home automations to close the curtains and turn off all electronics at home.</p><p>The sky's the limit with these automations; you really have access to boundless potential with the right mix of smart and dumb electronics at home.</p><p>Despite all that, the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card only costs $24.99, with frequent sales slashing that price to an even lower $19.99 price tag. It's a great buy overall, even if you don't end up using the smart home integration as much.</p>

It's easy to get caught up in the hype of the latest and greatest, but sometimes, the real value lies in a slightly older, yet still incredibly capable, device. Enter the Google Pixel 8a.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">the Pixel 9a</a> will soon be the budget Android champ, the 8a continues to be a compelling option for anyone seeking a great Android experience without spending too much money.</p><p>I'm not talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9a">whether or not you should upgrade</a>. I'm saying that if I needed a new phone, I'd buy a Pixel 8a as soon as the price drops with the release of the 9a.</p>

<h2 id="software-support-keeps-the-pixel-8a-like-new-2">Software support keeps the Pixel 8a like new</h2>
<p>One of the most significant selling points of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> was its long-term software support, and that's what makes it the phone I would buy today. Google has pledged a remarkable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of OS and security updates</a> for the 8a, mirroring the flagship Pixel 8 series. This means your device will remain secure and up-to-date with the latest Android features well <strong>into the 2030s</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHU5qGpvPUBNcyUSFjK8M4" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-08.jpg" alt="The back of the Bay blue Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHU5qGpvPUBNcyUSFjK8M4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This changes things. In the past, buying an older model of Android meant you would probably see the manufacturer drop support for it before you were ready to stop using it. Seven years means you'll be using something else before Google says goodbye to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>In a market where many mid-range phones receive only a couple of years of support, this extended lifespan is a major advantage. It ensures your investment is protected, and you won't be forced to upgrade prematurely due to software obsolescence.</p><p>This extended support isn't just about security patches, but it doesn't mean the 8a will be updated to do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">nearly everything Google dreams up in the future</a>. The Pixel series is renowned for its AI-powered capabilities, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for photos to the Call Assist features that make communication smoother.</p><p>With seven years of updates, the Pixel 8a will see some feature improvements here and there, but you shouldn't count on anything new. You can, however, know that the phone's software should work as well or better at the end of seven years as it did on day one. That's a big deal.</p>
<h2 id="long-software-support-is-just-part-of-the-picture-2">Long software support is just part of the picture</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4LoRMCV4CBHh7tFn2xGiA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-cameras" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right), the 8a slightly overlapping the 9a corner.

<p>Beyond the software, the Pixel 8a boasts impressive hardware for the price. The Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3 chip</a>, <em>mostly</em> the same processor found in the flagship Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, enables decent performance, fast app loading, and exceptional AI processing. The 8a handles everything I want a phone to do with ease.</p><p>The camera system is another highlight. The Pixel series has consistently delivered outstanding photography, and the 8a is no exception. Its dual rear camera setup isn't anything particularly special, but Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/computational-photography">computational photography</a> prowess shines through, producing stunning images with accurate colors, excellent dynamic range, and impressive low-light performance.</p><p>Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur further enhance the photography experience, allowing you to easily edit and improve your photos.</p><p>The Pixel 8a also features a great display. The OLED panel delivers rich colors and deep blacks, while the 120Hz refresh rate ensures fluid scrolling and animations. The device's compact size and comfortable design make it easy to hold and use, even for extended periods.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-by-tree" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting upright on a mossy surface leaning against a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the Pixel 9a. As with any new smartphone release, the arrival of the 9a will likely lead to a price drop for the Pixel 8a. This makes it an even more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. The 8a already offers excellent value at its current price, but a further reduction would make it an absolute steal.</p><p>Everything you've read and heard about the 8a still stands. It's still the same phone it was in 2024, and it will stay that way for seven years. The Google Pixel 8a is far from being outdated. Its long-term software support, capable hardware, excellent camera, and potential price drop make it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone without breaking the bank.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google Home and Nest speakers and displays as we know them may be doomed if the company's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> deprecations are any indication. Google Assistant is rapidly losing features as Google puts more time and effort into Gemini, its AI-based chatbot and assistant. Just this week, Google announced plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">remove seven more features from Google Assistant</a> in the future, following up the 18 features that were lost in early 2024.</p><p>As such, it's not an understatement to call the Google Assistant a shell of its former self. That isn't as much of an issue on smartphones and tablets, as Gemini serves as a better virtual assistant in many cases. When Gemini falls short, Android phones and tablets can take advantage of Assistant extensions to fill the gap. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">rumors point to Gemini replacing the Google Assistant on smartwatches</a> via a future Wear OS update, too.</p><p>There's just one problem — Gemini can't replace the Google Assistant on the smart home devices that need it most. Google hasn't refreshed its smart displays, including the second-generation Nest Hub and the Nest Hub Max, since 2021. It hasn't updated the Google Nest Mini smart speaker since 2019. That reality means that the affordable and aging Nest smart speakers and displays could be left without critical Assistant features <em>and</em> unable to run Gemini effectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM" name="google-tv-streamer-with-nest-cam-hands-on.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Nest Cam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCJAyKaEZHWppcZcezhaFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google quietly set a precedent for how it plans to get Gemini on smart home products last year, and it's bad news for fans of Nest hardware. The company completely killed the affordable Chromecast lineup in favor of the $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, which will soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-survey-previews-how-gemini-live-is-coming-to-the-big-screens">get Gemini Live and other AI features</a>.</p><p>With Google seemingly winding down Assistant and putting a greater focus on Gemini, I'm worried that the Nest lineup could share a similar fate. The company could shift toward more expensive (and powerful) smart home controllers, like the Pixel Tablet, which can better handle Gemini. That would be a mistake because Google Assistant is the perfect piece of software to run on affordable and lightweight smart home products.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aiSriPvXUhzR8ndHkNREWL" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-photo-library.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) photo library" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiSriPvXUhzR8ndHkNREWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to the age of Google Nest speakers and displays, they're starting to slow down, and features are beginning not to work as expected. In some instances, the platform has felt like an afterthought. Earlier this year, a bug <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests" target="_blank">caused Nest devices to fail to answer basic requests</a>, and it took weeks for users to get a fix.</p><p>On top of that, Google is actively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">killing key Google Assistant features</a>. Aside from the 18 features axed last year, the company recently updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=%2Cassistant-changes" target="_blank">support document</a> with seven new deprecations. For instance, you won't be able to change photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice anymore. While you can still do this manually on your Nest display, that kind of defeats the point of having a voice-equipped smart screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA" name="google-nest-mini-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Mini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDW3Lj2XFWRt7LUWkSEosA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the more egregious removals include the ability to get daily updates from your Google Assistant, such as requests like "Send me the weather every day." You also won't be able to favorite, share, or use your voice to ask about photos that were taken. Put simply, Nest hardware doesn't just lack new features — it's also consistently losing basic functionality and features.</p><p>It's understandable that Google doesn't want to spread itself too thin by working on Assistant and Gemini simultaneously, but it should consider all of the products in its portfolio. While Pixel phones and tablets are getting better by the day with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">new Gemini features</a>, Nest speakers and displays are seemingly getting worse by the day.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google regarding its plans for current and future Nest devices, as well as the state of Google Assistant, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-won-t-solve-the-problem-it-ll-make-it-worse-2">Gemini won't solve the problem, it'll make it worse </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the option to switch to Gemini was available today for Nest hardware, Google's recent Assistant feature removals would be defensible. However, it isn't, and I'm skeptical that Gemini is the solution to this problem. It's unlikely that a Gemini-based assistant could run on older Nest speakers and displays, leaving them stuck with a Google Assistant bleeding basic features.</p><p>The transition to Gemini might kill Nest smart home products as we know them. Existing hardware would almost certainly become less useful, as the Google Assistant has lost 25 features since the start of 2024. New hardware, if released, would probably be priced higher than current Nest speakers and displays to accommodate AI processing demands.</p><p>Historically, the great thing about the Google Nest family of products was that you could outfit your entire home with speakers, cameras, and displays without breaking the bank. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-mini-review">Nest Mini</a> speaker costs $50 at retail, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a> display costs $100 at retail.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google needs to upgrade Nest smart speakers and displays, like it upgraded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> and created the Google TV Streamer. Many of the devices in the Nest lineup are half a decade old, or older.</p><p>With that being said, it should be careful about creating new Nest speakers and displays that are more premium, more powerful, and more pricey.  If the future of Nest hardware is Gemini-powered products sold at a premium price, the brand's identity would be drastically changed.</p>

<hr>
<p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9"> Google Pixel 9</a> series support satellite connectivity, and major U.S. cellular carriers are gearing up to offer free satellite messaging for users of those models. Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum are both planning to offer satellite texting for customers "in the coming weeks" with a Galaxy S25 or Pixel 9. The move comes just one day after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizon-satellite-texting-us-customers-first-select-phones">Verizon became the first carrier to offer the service</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/charter-and-comcast-launch-satellite-connectivity-for-mobile-devices" target="_blank">announcement</a> reveals that Charter Communications and Comcast, which operate Xfinity and Spectrum Mobile respectively, are partnering with Skylo to deliver satellite messaging. The new functionality will give customers the "ability to send and receive SMS text messages over satellite service" and is "expected to be added in the coming weeks," per the company.</p><p>For now, satellite messaging appears to be limited to the Galaxy S25 lineup and the Pixel 9 series. Verizon's offering only applies to those models, and the same goes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/samsung-expands-comcast-5g-xfinity-mobile">Xfinity Mobile</a> and Spectrum's planned service.</p>

<p>The satellite messaging capabilities that will soon be offered by Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile will allow customers to text any number when Wi-Fi and cellular is unavailable using overhead satellites. This is in addition to the existing "Satellite SOS" feature offered by Google, which is only available in an emergency.</p><p>Spectrum and Xfinity Mobile aren't offering satellite messaging for iPhone users, but they might not need it as much as Android users. Starting with iOS 18, Apple offers free satellite messaging for users with an iPhone 14 or newer. Even though Samsung and Google sell phones capable of satellite connectivity, they've opted to leave it up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">cellular carriers</a> to provide the feature with their own non-terrestrial network (NTN) service providers.</p><p>"The availability of satellite backup service provides Spectrum Mobile customers with a sense of security, knowing they can stay connected even in the most remote locations," said Danny Bowman, who is the executive vice president of product at Charter Communications, in a press release.</p>

<ul><li>Gmail is rolling out a new, upgraded version of mail search that can prioritize "most relevant" results.</li><li>Users can still manually sort "most recent" results to get the list in chronological order.</li><li>The feature is rolling out now for personal Google accounts, and will eventually come to business accounts in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is upgrading Gmail's search smarts with AI to prioritize relevant results over recent keyword hits, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, March 20. While the old version of search in Gmail showed the most recent keyword results in emails, the upgraded version will "now factor in elements like recency, most-clicked emails and frequent contacts."</p><p>The AI-powered search feature is arriving in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a> as "Most relevant" results. Users can now toggle between "Most relevant" and "Most recent," depending on the situation. Previously, Gmail defaulted to showing "Most recent" search results, and that was the only option available.</p><p>"With this update, the emails you’re looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," the company explains in the blog post.</p><p>You can see an example of how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> search results are changing in the graphic below, which shows the old results on the left and the new ones on the right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="cUVfCJm6ycQ46BUZVXvSV4" name="Gmail-Search-Upgrades" alt="The old and new search results in the Gmail app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUVfCJm6ycQ46BUZVXvSV4.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new version of search is rolling out worldwide in Gmail's web client, as well as the iOS and Android mobile apps. The feature will begin exclusive to personal Google accounts, though the company says it will expand upgraded Gmail search to business accounts "in the future."</p><p>Google has been steadily upgrading Gmail with artificial intelligence to make it easier to use, and more secure. At the end of last year, Gmail became equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">a new AI model designed to thwart phishing scams in emails</a>. This addition following similar scam-stopping AI features being added to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">Google Messages</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">Google Phone</a>.</p><p>Time will tell whether users prefer the new version of Gmail search over the old one. For people who constantly have to scroll to find old emails, "Most relevant" results may be more helpful. For others, switching back to "Most recent" could be a better option.</p>

That knocks the price of the super-powered smartphone down to only $499, which is <em>the same price</em> that the Pixel 9a is scheduled to have when it finally hits store shelves next month. No trade-in required, zero hassle involved. </p><p>To be totally honest, I&apos;m half-expecting Best Buy to remove the deal when they realize they&apos;ve made a mistake, so <strong>I&apos;d jump on this opportunity </strong><em><strong>fast</strong></em> if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<p><strong>Heads up, Google fans: this is NOT a test. </strong>You can buy the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> from Best Buy and get a whopping $600 off your purchase with carrier activation. That means you're getting Google's best device for the price of the budget-friendly Pixel 9a with no trade-in required. </p>
<p>The retailer is also offering up to $840 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device, which means you could even get the phone for free if you're lucky. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587896.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="75095aa8-13aa-4c7a-b2a7-f6c6c23b8966" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Google&apos;s answer to the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a super-powered device with a huge 6.8-inch AMOLED display, efficient Tensor G4 processor, and an impressive 16GB of RAM. You also get the latest AI-boosted software features, seven years of OS/security updates, and all of the fancy camera tech that made Google such a legendary OEM. </p><p>If I had to dig up some drawbacks, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a shame that the phone in question only comes with 128GB of storage, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl">comparing it with the S25 Ultra</a>, you&apos;re also losing the convenience of a built-in stylus. But again, this Best Buy deal is knocking the price down to only $499, so I&apos;m not going to spend too much time complaining. By all means skip this deal if you&apos;re happy with your current phone, but if you&apos;ve already had your eye on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, this offer is worth your immediate attention. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">modern smartphone</a> is a marvel of miniaturization, packing the power of a desktop computer into a device that fits in your hand. At the heart of this revolution lies the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gigahertz-versus-cores-what-makes-a-good-phone-chip">System on a Chip</a> (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors.</p><p>While companies like Apple and Google are known for "building" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips <em>and</em> can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products.</p><p>So, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="turning-an-idea-into-a-blueprint-2">Turning an idea into a blueprint</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF" name="8-gen.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/arm-announces-new-chip-architecture-focus-performance-security-and-ai">chip's architecture</a>. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals.</p><p>For Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy.</p><p>The core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor chips</a>, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options.</p><p>Each company knows what it needs better than anyone else does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd" name="apple-a18-graphic" alt="Apple A18 chip graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chipverify.com/tutorials/verilog" target="_blank">Verilog or VHDL</a> are used to "program" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all.</p><p>Once someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration.</p><p>From there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc" name="samsung-exynos-chip-generic-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2149" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC</a> is one of the biggest, but there are others — including Samsung's own foundry.</p><p>The company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line.</p><p>The process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the "good" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.</p>

<p>It's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative.</p><p>It allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs.</p><p>Instead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier.</p><p>Expertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology.</p>

While people will still be deciding whether to buy the Pixel 9a or not, it's fun to deliberate about what next Spring's Pixel 10a might look like and if it's worth waiting for.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a ushered in the biggest design change since the Pixel 6a, ditching the trademark Pixel camera bar for a nearly completely flat design. Google said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-inspiration-behind-pixel-camera-bar">the camera bar wouldn't stick around forever</a>, but few of us thought the company would ditch it this soon.</p><p>We've already seen a few leaks for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> series, including information relating to its chipset as well as model numbers for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-10-has-a-model-number-according-to-gsma-database-entries">wider Pixel 10 family</a>. For now, though, let's focus on Google's next budget-friendly phone, the Pixel 10a.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-what-s-likely-to-change"><span>Google Pixel 10a: What's likely to change</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest bit of concrete evidence we have on the Pixel 10a so far is its processor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-pixel-10a-pixel-11-series-codename-chip-leak">According to one leak</a>, the Google Pixel 10a will ship with a "boosted" version of the Tensor G4 chip inside the Pixel 9a. If so, that would mark the first time the company would ship a <em>different</em> chipset from the mainline series in a Pixel A-series phone, at least since Google started making Tensor chipsets.</p><p>Up until now, Google has shipped a nearly identical Tensor processor in A-series phones, enabling excellent photography capabilities, AI processing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9a-get">years of promised software updates</a>. However, Google has long had an issue with performance <em>and</em> overheating, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the first to solve only half of that equation — the overheating issue.</p><p>A boosted Tensor G4 could mean that Google is further tweaking the Tensor G4's thermal properties, allowing the company to speed the processor up without reintroducing the old overheating problems of Pixels' past.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 10a might be the first Tensor-based Pixel that doesn't get the same processor as the rest of the familial line.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The downside to this strategy is that the Pixel 10a wouldn't benefit from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">the Tensor G5</a> that's rumored to launch inside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. While we're not expecting the Tensor G5 to introduce many major performance improvements, the new processor is rumored to come alongside a suite of changes that could prove beneficial, including a new GPU, a new ISP, and a new display processor.</p><p>This could mean that the Pixel 10a doesn't see display, camera, or gaming performance improvements compared to the rest of the Pixel 10 series. Of course, all of this is based on leaks and rumors, but it's worth noting the hypothetical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel A-series is long overdue for charging improvements and an LTPO display.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Every generation, we see Google add at least one display enhancement from the mainline Pixel series to the equivalent Pixel A-series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> introduced a 120Hz display for the first time in Pixel A-series history, while the Pixel 9a's display is now as bright as the ones on the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The only thing missing is LTPO technology, which we surmise Google will add next year to further improve battery life.</p><p>Speaking of battery life, the Pixel A-series is long overdue for a charging speed upgrade. Google gave the Pixel 9a a very <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-fast-is-the-google-pixel-9a-charging-speed">minor charging speed bump</a>, but the mainline Pixel 9 series charges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">twice as fast</a>. Even that pales in comparison to competitors like OnePlus, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">offers 80W charging</a> <em>with a charger included</em> in the box. It's very possible that the Pixel 10a may finally adopt 30W charging to keep up with the pack, but I don't foresee Google doing more than that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We could see the return of multiple phone sizes with the Pixel 10a, something we haven't seen since the Pixel 4a days.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly is the possibility that Google could finally offer multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a. The last time the company offered multiple Pixel A-series model sizes was with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4a-5g-vs-pixel-4a">Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G</a>. A rumor circled for a while that the Pixel 8a would see the return of multiple sizes, but that has yet to materialize.</p><p>While we're certainly not confident that Google <strong>will</strong> return to offering multiple sizes, the company has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">expanding its portfolio of devices</a> in recent years, so now would make a lot of sense for them to make a move like this.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10a-what-we-expect-to-stay-the-same"><span>Google Pixel 10a: What we expect to stay the same</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-2" alt="The Iris, Peony, Obsidian, and Porcelain Google Pixel 9a in a jumbled pile on a brown desk surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KAksn6WMNiah55RUJEYLCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as how the Pixel 9a just drastically changed the design compared to the Pixel 6a, 7a, and 8a, we don't expect the company to change much for the Pixel 10a. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/news-weekly-march-15-2025">Pixel 10 leaks</a> show that Google is largely keeping the design identical between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series, so there's not much reason to expect it would do anything different with the Pixel 10a.</p><p>Likewise, the Pixel 10a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">ditched the camera bar</a> to make a thicker, flatter phone with a bigger battery. As such, there's little reason to expect Google to change the battery at all on the Pixel 10a. Thankfully, though, the Pixel 9a boasts the best battery life of any Tensor-based Pixel phone to date, at least on paper.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Don't expect to see many design or camera changes next year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the subject of cameras, leaks show that Google may offer a telephoto camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">on the smaller Pixel 10</a> this year, but we haven't seen anything that points to a telephoto camera being offered on a Pixel A-series device yet. If Google does make multiple sizes of the Pixel 10a, there's a possibility that we could see the addition of a telephoto camera. Otherwise, don't count on that changing.</p><p>We also don't foresee Google changing the $499 price much, if at all, for the Pixel 10a. All things considered, Google's aim with this series is to keep it as affordable as possible. With the rumor that the Pixel 10a will be using a Tensor G4 again, plus several design changes on the Pixel 9a that make manufacturing simpler and less expensive, there's no reason to think Google will change the price in 2026.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 series was announced several months before the Pixel 8 series, launching in August 2024 instead of the traditional October timeline. That trend stayed the same with the Pixel 9a which was announced in mid-March rather than in mid-May when Google I/O takes place.</p><p>It doesn't seem like Google will repeat this trend and will likely keep the Pixel 10 series on an annual release timeline. Even if they do continue the 2-month-early trend, that means the earliest we'll hear anything official about the Google Pixel 10a will be sometime in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Until then, we'll be covering every leak and rumor that gives us a clearer picture of what Google's 2026 budget release will pack.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro deals</span></h3>
<p>For the first time ever, the Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there&apos;s also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL deals</span></h3>
<p>Probably the most surprising smartphone announced during Made by Google 2024, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL picks up where Google left off with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review">Pixel 4 XL</a> years ago. It&apos;s essentially a bigger version of the Pixel 9 Pro, with a 6.8-inch LTPO display, 16GB of RAM, and a slightly larger battery. The XL phone starts at $1,099 for the 128GB version, or you could go up to 1TB to get more storage.</p>

<p>The first two-hour session of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a> that I finished was met with a surreal sense of spatial juxtaposition. One moment ago, my living room was a starship complete with alien plants and an infinite storage system that tied in neatly with my basement. The next moment, I was back to my normal old living room with nothing nearly as exciting in it.</p><p>Another recent mixed reality game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand</a>, turned my living room into a store in the mall. This sounds rather strange until the zombies start breaking in the boarded-up windows, and you suddenly realize you've been placed in a movie frame of the classic movie Dawn of the Dead. Even after taking the headset off, I expected a zombie to break through my sliding glass door at any moment.</p><p>It's this sense of "making new memories in people's physical spaces" that gets me so excited about mixed reality games and why Meta's latest mixed reality capabilities update is so important. Meta Quest developers can now use your Meta Quest 3's cameras to create even more immersive content thanks to the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>.</p><p>So what does this mean and how is Meta protecting your privacy? Between Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/gdc-2025-design-strategies-considerations-tips-mr-vr-horizon-os/">blog post</a>, the company's presentation at GDC, and my own discussions with Meta representatives and Meta Quest developers, I've found some rather interesting new concepts developers are working with to create the future of immersive mixed reality gaming.</p>
<h2 id="camera-data-is-the-pandora-s-box-of-mixed-reality-2">Camera data is the Pandora's Box of mixed reality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa" name="wall-town-wonders-quest-3s-hero" alt="Playing Wall Town Wonders in mixed reality on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnEHje5EXkFwjwLDJXywSa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time, Meta has restricted Meta Quest camera access to developers. Games like Starship Home, The Last Stand, The Infinite Inside, and <em>all</em> others rely entirely on what the Meta Horizon OS tells them your room looks like. These games only know your walls exist because the OS tells them. Likewise, your dining room table might be considered a desk because you defined that during the headset's setup process.</p><p>Everything was pre-baked, including the size and shape, which means developers could only work with whatever data the headset fed them. Now, thanks to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">camera passthrough API</a>, Meta Quest apps are able to actually <strong>see</strong> your room — assuming you permit them — and understand the objects within.</p><p>Let's look at a side-by-side of what I'm talking about:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.18%;"><img id="2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-data-march-2025" alt="Meta Quest 3 room setup and passthrough image data from the older camera space setup API" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ME7VMv4JnqRRAUdnmZEV8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3838" height="1235" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The current mixed reality kit is very boxy. Future apps and games will finally understand room geometry and nuance that makes mixed reality games more convincing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While the headset is mapping your room during the initial setup process, you'll see it building a complex mesh of polygons so it can recreate your physical space in a virtual environment. This data was previously only accessible by the headset itself and never shared with an app.</p><p>Instead, the app would only be given the data on the right. Notice how the box that defines my couches doesn't line up with the actual height of the couch since the couch <em>isn't a box</em>? The same problem occurs with my dining room table, which is oval in shape, yet the older room setup only allows for square or rectangular tables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD" name="meta-quest-3-camera-passthrough-mixed-reality-game" alt="Virtual characters standing on top of a physical couch unconvincingly due to geometry constraints of older Meta Quest space understanding models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3kgH2xvfmRuj88rbWTvqZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soon, these characters in Twenty Guys may be standing on your actual couch instead of the predefined boundaries the headset creates. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This new solution allows apps and games to better identify the space around you, resulting in more realistic (and less hokey) mixed reality experiences.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Now that Meta is expanding the use of camera data to apps, developers may soon be able to program their apps and games to more intelligently understand the geometry of objects. That means no more weirdly floating characters in a mixed-reality space.</p><p>That also means when a virtual object hides behind a physical one, it'll look much more convincing since it won't be hiding behind a square box but, instead, your rather curvy living room chair. This can extend to zombies banging on your windows instead of virtual recreations of a window, goop oozing out of sinks, spiders <em>convincingly </em>crawling out of vents, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-in-flux-2">The future is in flux</h2>
<p>After Apple Vision Pro launched, lots of people came up with interesting ideas of what mixed reality concepts could look like. Some used mixed reality to gamify chores so you can vacuum <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/19dpo3v/spatial_vacuuming_never_miss_a_spot_again/">and never miss a spot again</a>. Apps like this will work even better now that they have access to camera data, as they'll be able to properly identify areas rather than just using prebuilt data from the headset.</p><p>Others used the idea to completely transform their rooms into completely different decor using generative AI. While this video is a mockup and not a real app you can use today, it might give you an idea of what to expect from mixed reality concepts in the future:</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBbdiGqJxpk/" target="_blank">A post shared by Technology (@technology)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>The new passthrough camera API is built upon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camera2">Android's Camera2 API</a>, according to Meta, helping it tie deeply in with the Quest's hardware. This means apps can utilize data from the camera and adjust it as needed, helping virtual objects to better match the lighting and color of your room.</p><p>Things look different during sunlit days than they do in artificial nighttime light, and this new API can help play a part in making those virtual objects look more convincing in your actual space.</p><p>In addition to that, the new API lets apps use the Quest's camera to capture imagery of your room and add it to virtual objects. This can be as simple as taking a picture of a person's face and adding it to a rudimentary character model — as you see above — or something more realistic like your actual living room reflecting in a pool of virtual water in a game.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The new passthrough API allows the Quest's cameras to capture your room and put it on virtual objects, or just more seamlessly blend the virtual and real worlds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Better spatial awareness will enable your headset to further transform the room around you into something both familiar yet unique and always memorable. Spatial awareness holds a special meaning for our brains and even bespoke experiences like this masterful airplane cockpit someone built.</p><p>From what I've seen, this is one of the most convincing uses of mixed reality to date. Most people don't have access to an empty airplane cockpit in their garage, but being able to turn your favorite chair into a convincing airplane cockpit — complete with its texture accurately positioned inside the virtual cockpit — would make an incredibly convincing game of Flight Simulator without all the expensive add-ons and accessories some people spend a lot of money on.</p><p>As with anything XR, this is just the beginning of something new and interesting that'll play a part in what's coming down the line. Google's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system also allows passthrough access for apps, meaning developers can get a jump start on making concepts now so that games and apps are more mature when that OS — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">future AR glasses hardware</a> — begins shipping to customers, content will be there waiting for them.</p>

Even though Apple is still at the top of the table, it saw the highest decline percentage in sales of 19%. Counterpoint Research claims that this could be due to several reasons, including people opting out of an upgrade due to a lack of new features or design. The research firm also says it could be because their first-time experience with the watch didn't go as planned.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Wear OS-powered watches and those running proprietary OSes scored some brownie points from customers as smartwatch sales saw a steady uptick this past year despite an overall slump across the globe.</p><p>Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei saw exponential growth, especially the former making its way to the top five this year. Xiaomi also became the fastest-growing brand, seeing a 135% rise in sales, thanks to the Watch S1<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/xiaomi-watch-wear-os-3-rumor"> </a>and Redmi Watch series. It began selling new Wear OS models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomi-watch-2-pro-official-wear-os-3">Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro</a>, in the 4th quarter of 2023, which likely contributed to this massive growth in 2024.</p><p>Huawei scored second, seeing a 35% increase in sales, although it notably does not sell Wear OS watches. Samsung placed third overall and also witnessed a 3% growth, thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/samsungs-reinforced-galaxy-watch-7-lineup-to-boost-revenue-growth-in-2024" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and Galaxy Watch FE Series, as seen in the infographic above.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, Apple released its first-ever Apple Watch Series, which was initially seen as a fashion accessory. That slowly took a turn to become the multi-faceted fitness tracker it is today.</p><p>According to data from Demandsage (a research firm), Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.demandsage.com/smartwatch-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20454.69%20million%20smartwatch%20users%20worldwide.">rules</a> 21% of the global smartwatch market, but the recent decline in sales for the first time points to evolving customer preferences, increased competition from other brands, and a slowing upgrade cycle.</p><p>"Apple’s steep decline was a result of the combination of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentlawyermagazine.com/apple-v-masimo-the-clash-over-pulse-oximetry-patents/">Apple's infringement lawsuit against Masimo</a>, increasing market competition, less significant upgrades in Watch Series 10, and the absence of Watch Ultra 3," Counterpoint's Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain told Android Central in an email.</p>

<p>Much like its iPhones today, Apple has stuck to the same Watch design for years. The first significant change showed up on the Apple Watch 4, which brought about larger screens and a more defined casing while maintaining the same rounded rectangular dial. Later the Series 7 brought with it thinner bezels, and even more larger screens. Cut to the Series 8, where Apple decided to give its watches a more rugged look and launched the Ultra (a sight for sore eyes).</p><p>Don't get me wrong, Apple has brought several advancements in tech, sensors, and processors over the years. But its overall "look" at first glance remained the same.</p><p>According to Gemini's AI Overviews, "people generally upgrade their Apple Watches every 2-3 years." Or when they notice significant performance issues or a life-altering feature, they'd want to ditch a year-old watch for a new one. For instance, I currently own an Apple Watch Series 8, which was a replacement and not a planned upgrade.</p><p>My Series 6 stopped working after water damage while swimming, which made it practically unusable. The Series 8 brought with it features that track women's health better, and for someone with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, owning a watch that predicts ovulation cycles was a neat feature to have, and I continue to use it to date.</p><p>Jain also agrees that "the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases," especially in North America— which was the biggest driver of this decline in sales for Apple.</p>

<p>While it would be unfair to pit Apple against the broader variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, due to the sheer number of manufacturers involved. However, as much as it isn't fair, Wear OS has become the undeniable alternative for many, sporting a ton of options, has seamlessly integrated into the Android ecosystem without people needing to change devices, and does almost everything that an Apple Watch could do.</p><p>Android Central's senior editor, Nick Sutrich, who uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, highlights the same. Switching between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the OnePlus Watch 3, Sutrich says that he has two main reasons why the Apple Watch just isn't for him. One, it's incompatibility with Android, and two, he hates the shape they come in.</p><p>"Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications," Sutrich said. "I'd say I don't have a perfect choice at the moment. I prefer the Pixel Watch's size but like the OnePlus Watch 3's design and its battery life," Sutrich explained, demonstrating the flexibility that Wear OS watches bring, allowing users to pick between features that matter the most to them.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Wear OS, much like Android, is an open ecosystem that allows more freedom in terms of app availability and customization; for instance, Wear OS users can even create their own watch faces using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a> available to those with a developer account. This freedom of personalizing your wearable without worrying about the phone's compatibility appeals to several people who choose to use a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch over an Apple.</p><p>Furthermore, the affordability and hardware variety of Wear OS also drives people to reach for them. The recent decision of OEMs like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and OPPO to join the Wear OS family, which was mostly dominated by Samsung and Google, has not only resulted in a diverse range of watch designs and styles to pick from but has also made smartwatches much more accessible for those on a tight budget. This might've potentially impacted Apple's sales as well, according to Jain.</p><p>"Huawei’s comeback with Harmony OS, the rise of Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Honor, and the adoption of Samsung’s newly launched Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE series intensified competition for Apple in 2024," she added.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold-2">What does the future hold?</h2>
<p>While the overall smartwatch sales did see a dip globally, this could also be attributed to several people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/gadgets/are-smart-rings-the-future-smartwatch-sales-decline-as-wearable-trends-shift">wanting to move away from smartwatches</a> for a much smaller fitness tracker like the smart ring. For instance, Android Central's EIC, Shruti Shekar, says she never really cared for watches; after using the Apple Watch 5—which negatively impacted her mental wellbeing, she decided to get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a>.</p><p>"I took on the ring and found myself loving it so much more than the watch," she explained. "I found the passive health nature of the Oura Ring a lot more up my alley than a watch."</p><p>That said, the future of Apple and Wear OS watches seems promising as both brands are working on bringing advanced health-tracking features. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 11 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch-series-11#:~:text=The%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%2011,contrast%20as%20an%20OLED%20screen." target="_blank">rumored</a> to have blood glucose tracking and satellite messaging features in the next Watch Ultra, which could turn the tide in their direction, according to Jain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iTGJfBgcANT3ijxCKkDPNZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-sensors-underside-02" alt="A top-down view of the OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) without bands, showing the health sensors and connection points" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTGJfBgcANT3ijxCKkDPNZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Apple is expected to recover in 2025 with a low single-digit YoY shipment growth."</p><p>"This is based on the expectations of the introduction of a satellite messaging feature in Apple’s Watch Ultra 3 in 2025 and the anticipated launch of the Watch SE 3 with an upgraded design."</p><p>Jain also points out that with the rising adoption of Wear OS, we could expect advanced health monitoring features, improved battery life, and greater emphasis on personalization and customization.</p><p>For instance, the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4#section-google-pixel-watch-4-rumors-and-patents">Pixel Watch</a> could see a "rounded-edge bezel turned into a squeezable, touch-sensitive control interface," along with a smartwatch "Fit Score" that informs the user of the"differences in wrist size, skin color, hair density, BMI, fat percentage, and the likes."</p><p>Integrating AI into their products could also push sales in the right direction. With more comprehensive health-tracking analysis combined with powerful hardware, like "health sensors for measuring bodily signals such as serious heart health tracking, focusing on atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, hypertension, and diabetes to sustain their position in the market," Jain explained.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> delays have affected every part of the processes, from the beta testing stages to the confirmation of exactly which Galaxy phones and tablets will support the new operating system. The South Korean company has provided a bit more clarity on device support in recent weeks, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/sg/samsung-electronics-singapore-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-from-14-april" target="_blank">post</a> today, March 20, on the Samsung Newsroom in Singapore — adding 15 new models to the list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-update-for-more-galaxy-devices/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>).</p><p>Previous announcements from Samsung revealed that in addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, which debuted with One UI 7, the older Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23 lineups would support the upgrade. On top of that, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 would also be supported. The same goes for the Galaxy Tab S9 and Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>Now, the list of supported One UI 7 devices expands to a total of 34 models, including the following new additions:</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S22</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Plus</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</li></ul>
<p>Notably, the expanded list adds the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S21 series, as well as two more generations of older Samsung foldables. The press release notes that the rollout for One UI 7 will begin on April 14 for these devices in Singapore.</p>

<hr>
<p>Huawei's latest phone launch is here and it's truly walking the line between foldable designs.</p><p>The Chinese OEM debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/pura-x/">the Pura X</a> foldable phone today (Mar. 20); however, the device seemingly teeters between clamshell and bookstyle foldable designs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633159/huawei-pura-x-flip-phone-wide-1610-aspect-ratio-harmonyos-next">The Verge</a>). When folded, the Pura X looks like your standard clamshell foldable; however, you'll note that the hinge is to the left, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. On the front, the Pura X features a 3.5-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate and a 1440 Hz high-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>.</p><p>Above that rounded corner square cover screen is the Pura X's triple camera array. The horizontal housing features a 50MP primary lens with f/1.6 aperture and OIS (optical image stabilization). This is joined by a 40MP ultra-wide angled lens and an 8MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Opening the Pura X is where things take a more book-style turn as Huawei provided it with an immersively wide 6.3-inch OLED display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The company states it features 2,500nits of peak brightness and 1,440Hz PWM dimming.</p><p>Huawei really doubles down on the width and broadness of this foldable's display, stating users can enjoy such a view in landscape or portrait mode. For viewing videos, Huawei says users can experience a "broad field of vision" when in landscape and even gaming. However, going vertical sees "pictures and text displayed more widely with clear content."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1457px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="tauUF6wtT777xzPyBUGdgm" name="huawei-pura-x-foldable-white-example" alt="The Huawei Pura X foldable in white, showcasing its cover display and internal screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tauUF6wtT777xzPyBUGdgm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1457" height="820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pura X contains a wide variety of Huawei's AI and HarmonyOS software. The cover display features alternating "intelligent lighting effects," the ability to turn photos into stickers on the lock screen, and cute/interactive pets. Users can also use the camera in the phone's folded state for sharp selfies and more. Huawei also added its in-house AI assistant, Pangu, via Harmony Intelligence. As The Verge notes, this is the first of its phones to do so.</p><p>Huawei's latest device boasts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-devices-are-losing-support-for-android-apps-heres-why-its-a-good-thing">HarmonyOS Next</a> (OS 5). One of the main highlights of this software is its notable lack of Android app support. The company discussed this new vision of its software in 2024, stating it would be built on its own custom architecture instead of the Android Open Source Project.</p><p>Internally, the Pura X steps up its cooling game with the " ultra-cold three-dimensional cooling system." Huawei says this technology improves the phone's heat dissipation and efficiency. What's more, the foldable contains a 4,720mAh battery with 66W wired charging. Those purchasing it in China will find 12GB of RAM and the choice of 256GB and 512GB internal storage. Moreover, the Collector's Edition takes things up to 16/512GB and 16/1TB.</p><p>The Huawei Pura X starts at 7,499 yuan (~$1,034) in Stylish Red, Stylish Green, Moon Shadow Gray, Zero White, and Phantom Night Black. For now, the phone remains restricted to the Chinese market. There's no word when/if it will make its way overseas.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has been spotted sending out a saddening email to its consumers today (Mar. 20) about its recent smartphone launch.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evowizz/status/1902658736096715098?">Dylan Roussel</a> on X drew attention to the unexpected Nothing Community email for users who pre-ordered the Phone 3a Pro (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/your-nothing-3a-pro-preorder-may-take-longer-to-arrive/">Android Police</a>). According to Nothing, those who've pre-purchased the latest 3a Pro will receive their devices sometime in mid-April. The email states the devices will be "shipped before April 15."</p><p>The email adds that the delay is "due to demand," meaning a lot of others have been trying to get their hands on it and forced Nothing to slow things down. The company states it will continue to keep its consumers updated on the status of their pre-ordered Nothing Phone 3a Pro until it ships in mid-April.</p><p>The publication claims this delay will impact consumers in Europe more than other regions where Nothing's phone is available. It seems those in Spain and the U.S. are still on schedule, though color availability varies for the former.</p><p>It'll be worth keeping an eye on your email just as a precaution to ensure you're up to date on the status of your pre-ordered Phone 3a Pro.</p>

<p>Nothing generated a lot of hype with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro launch</a> during MWC 2025. While the duo picked up six years of "essential" updates and loads of new Nothing AI software, one of the standouts is the sheer upgraded camera arrays. Nothing also included a new physical button, the Essential Key, to produce its AI hub "Essential Spaces." From there, users will have full access to their device's AI features like voice notes, saved content, and more.</p><p>The Phone 3a runs for $379 while the Pro version goes for $459. However, it's worth noting that both devices are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/">currently sold out</a> in the U.S., leaving Nothing's expected restock to take place "within 2 months" for the Phone 3a.</p><p>Interestingly, Nothing was quick to begin updating and refining its Phone 3a Pro experience with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-3a-pro-gains-first-update-ahead-of-release">pre-launch OTA update</a> ten days ago (on Mar. 10). The company focused on the cameras by giving users a way to access camera presets, as well as the option of sharing those with others. The Essential Spaces also grabbed a QoL update that lets users save what's on the screen and add a note/voice recording when saving it.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be prepping a new Google Messages feature that will let you delete RCS chats remotely.</li><li>The feature will only work on newer devices updated to support the latest RCS Universal Profile.</li><li>You'll be able to delete RCS chats for everyone within 15 minutes after originally sending the message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> looks poised to borrow a key iMessage feature in a future update: deleting RCS chats for everyone. Currently, if you delete an RCS chat in Google Messages, it'll only remove it from your device. Anyone else that has already received the message will keep it, which isn't good enough for awkward texting mishaps. This might be changing soon, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rcs-delete-sent-texts-3536278/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has discovered what could be the user-interface for remote chat deletion in a Google Messages beta.</p><p>Android Authority found the UI by scouring through the <strong>messages.android_20250317_01_RC00.phone.openbeta_dynamic</strong> APK release. Although the publication notes that the feature isn't publicly accessible, it did manage to discover a new deletion option in this Google Messages version.</p><p>It's called "Delete for everyone," and allows users to remotely delete RCS chats. Like the "unsend" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-imessage-android">iMessage feature</a>, Google Messages notes that "messages may still be seen by others on older app versions." As such, this feature will become most useful not when it publicly releases, but months or years later as Android users move to new Google Messages versions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1870px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.94%;"><img id="Xme2AC9Jw8gp2Zpf3oFVEn" name="Google-Messages-RCS-Delete" alt="Deleting RCS chats for everyone with Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xme2AC9Jw8gp2Zpf3oFVEn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1870" height="1364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When a message is deleted, a placeholder bubble will appear in the chat that reads "Message deleted." Unlike typical messages, there isn't a white or colored background for this bubble. Instead, it's clear and shows the background color of your conversation.</p><p>There are a few limitations to remote message deletion for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chats</a> in Google Messages. For starters, older devices won't be able to participate, since the feature utilizes a newer version of the RCS Universal Profile. Additionally, you can only delete a message for everyone within the first 15 minutes after it's been sent.</p><p>If you delete a chat after the 15-minute time limit has expired, it'll only be deleted from your device. There's also an option to only delete a chat from your device within the time threshold. It's unclear when or if Google might release this feature, but it is clearly in development.</p>

<ul><li>Google confirmed in a statement that its Pixel 9a features an older Exynos modem that previously gave other Pixels issues.</li><li>The device rocks the Exynos 5300 modem which, per reports from 2023, gave Pixel 8 users quite the headache with bad reception and battery drain issues.</li><li>It also looks like the Pixel 9a lacks satellite connectivity as the newer Exynos 5400 modem in the flagship Pixel 9 series contains such support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly delivering confirmation on a specification change for its recent budget Pixel.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9a-modem-3535985/">Android Authority</a>, Google has reportedly confirmed that it is not using the same Samsung Exynos modem inside the Pixel 9a. The device is stated to use the Exynos 5300 modem with the Tensor G4 chipset instead of the newer Exynos 5400 — like the rest of the Pixel 9 series. While there are (typically) some downgrades expected when you swap to more affordability, this one might impact consumers.</p><p>As the publication notes, the Exynos 5400 modem was sought after due to its improvements over the 5300 version. Specifically, it boosted a phone's cellular reception, battery life, and a few internal heating problems. This could cause some issues as the post reiterates problems the Pixel 6 series had with the same Exynos 5300 modem.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">surge of reports from users</a> with a Pixel 8 series model also voiced severe issues with this older modem in 2023. Many of the reports saw users complain about connectivity and overheating issues with that older modem. There was a problematic battery draining issue when using mobile data, which saw the 5300 as the main culprit.</p><p>Users in 2023 said they could barely squeeze five hours out of their Pixel 8 before they needed to charge.</p>

<p>During the era of Pixel 9 rumors, the Exynos 5400 modem was brought up and within that conversation was the topic of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">a new connectivity option</a>. Samsung outfitted the Exynos 5400 with support for 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In short, that's satellite connectivity. Those early rumors claimed the newer modem was not only faster but also more power efficient, potentially solving those battery drain issues.</p><p>When it came to Pixel 9a rumors, this new modem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">wasn't mentioned</a>. In its place was the Exynos 5300 modem — which we've now seen confirmed to be true today.</p><p>This development could also impact a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizon-satellite-texting-us-customers-first-select-phones">announcement from Verizon</a>: the existence of satellite texting support for its U.S. customers. The cellular provider announced yesterday (Mar. 19) that it is starting to roll out satellite texting support in the U.S. for Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 phones, meaning its customers will be the first to have such an ability.</p><p>There were concerns about whether or not the Pixel 9a was involved and it seems the budget phone is left out, given the Exynos 5300's lack of satellite support.</p>

<p>Meta's Oculus Publishing initiative led to 100 new games in 2024, but the $50 million Horizon Worlds creator fund has led to criticisms — including from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-its-time-to-kill-horizon-worlds-before-it-kills-the-meta-quest">my colleague Nick Sutrich</a> — that Meta isn't prioritizing traditional developers anymore.</p><p>Pruett responded that they still have 200 titles in active development through Oculus Publishing. They also are funding 21 developers through the Ignition program, which they announced at GDC 2024 to support laid-off developers.</p><p>He did admit that Oculus Publishing is now looking for a "very different" type of content targeting new audiences — more on that later — but as the head of content for the biggest VR platform in the world, Pruett used his GDC 2025 platform to reassure developers that they shouldn't assume the Meta money well has dried up. Nor should they feel forced to target teens.</p>

<p>Other "theories" Pruett set out to debunk at GDC were that Meta had shifted its priorities from paid apps to free-to-play in-app payments (F2P IAPs) or that revenue had fallen because Meta opened up its store to App Lab titles.</p><p>Pruett said they did a substantial "data analysis" to determine the shift in its users' purchases. They found that most users buy a ton of games after they first unbox their VR headset but then never return to the Quest Store to browse, except when "off-platform advertising" draws them to one specific title. Store placement doesn't matter, except in the peak moments like Black Friday and Christmas when Quest activations spike.</p><p>Teens are more active Quest users year-round, but they're much more "price sensitive" and, like adults, tend to let external sources like streamers, influencers, and friends dictate what they're willing to try.</p><p>Overall, Pruett said, "paid apps are still the majority of our revenue on the platform by an overwhelming margin." F2P IAPs have steadily climbed, but they're not necessarily stealing money from customers who used to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">critically acclaimed Quest titles</a>. Instead, the old VR guard isn't spending as consistently as it used to, and the new customer base skews younger and prefers "meme games" to emotional AAA titles.</p><p>He pointed to internal Meta data that the opened app store and Horizon Worlds push in the mobile app decreased Quest Store profits by "<1%" and "3%," respectively, while overall store profits climbed by 12% in 2024. So, in Pruett's mind, the impact of these changes was "very small," even if individual developers saw declines.</p>
<h2 id="devs-can-t-count-on-meta-s-quest-store-changes-to-save-them-2">Devs can't count on Meta's Quest Store changes to save them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7jgSq9Y4iAqx6bCEV6h2Nn" name="animal-company-official-screenshot" alt="An official press screenshot of two different gameplay moments showing silly cartoonish characters interacting with one another in Animal Company on Meta Quest 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jgSq9Y4iAqx6bCEV6h2Nn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Games like Animal Company dominate the most popular games category on the Quest Store. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wooster Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I did, in hindsight, find Pruett's argument flawed. Turning the Quest Store from a curated experience into a free-for-all Steam-like that prioritizes Horizon Worlds obviously impacted <em>some</em> developers; the fact that new developers have swept in to claim record profits doesn't refute the fact that other games that would once have stood out are now instantly buried.</p><p>Opening up the Quest Store was the right decision to find fresh indie content for a younger audience. But Pruett's analysis doesn't consider the reason <em>why</em> older VR gamers aren't coming back to the Quest Store after unboxing their Quest — presumably, because it's overwhelmingly bloated and because the top-selling titles skew towards the teen audience.</p><p>Meta does recognize this fact, even if it doesn't take ownership of developers' struggles. It's hiring more people to improve the Quest Store, improving personalized recommendations and game filter options, and revamping game pages to allow devs to share user-generated content and social media posts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LMZ5LYKbriqDcXAMD676md" name="meta-horizon-worlds-meta-quest-3-quest-3s" alt="A Meta Quest 3 and a Meta Quest 3S headset on a table with a Horizon Worlds portal behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMZ5LYKbriqDcXAMD676md.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, though, Pruett's talk makes clear that developers need to find alternative ways to reach audiences, not simply hope they stand out by quality and old successes.</p><p>During the Q&A, I asked Pruett if Meta is seeking alternative marketing methods outside of the Quest Store or if developers need to do this themselves. He answered that he sees Meta's biggest job as "increasing the amount of time people spend in the headset." Developers have a "much stronger lever" for keeping users invested in <em>specific</em> titles, but they need to look for alternatives to traditional Quest Store discoverability or buying ads.</p><p>The "big spikes in success" that many devs saw came "because they went viral on TikTok or on Instagram," Pruett said, and he thinks devs are "underleveraging" this resource.</p><p>He also pointed out how the devs behind games like Gorilla Tag and Animal Company have done a great job of building and managing a "robust community" on platforms like Discord, which allows them to pull users back into their game any time they announce an update.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-big-audience-for-vr-and-quest-according-to-pruett-2">The next big audience for VR and Quest, according to Pruett</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zy52mEQEqH27EssZVjNhhc" name="Meta-GDC-2025-content-breakdown" alt="A GDC 2025 presentation slide showing the type of content the Meta Quest Store needs and the audiences that developers should target." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zy52mEQEqH27EssZVjNhhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pruett says the store needs a wide range of content for different audiences, not just the F2P meme games dominating the headlines. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pruett's talk ran through the different demographics of VR gamers who bought Quests over the years, from PC VR power users to "VR Elites" who bought the Quest 2 and 3, ending with the current youth influx via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>. These groups aren't going away, but Meta's internal data suggests a new demographic will grow substantially on Quest in the next few years: "mainstream adults."</p><p>For this group, Pruett says, gaming is a "secondary pastime." These "30-something dads" will see Meta Quest as a "really high-end TV." And "as the resolution of [Meta's] devices increases," using a headset as a TV replacement becomes more "viable."</p><p>While this group is small now, Meta predicts that by 2027, mainstream adults will be the next "major player" on Quest after the teen influx. That's why Pruett said developers shouldn't pivot to teen games to join Oculus Publishing. Instead, they want developers to start making content now for the "mainstream" non-gamer crowd in a couple of years.</p><p>I found this fascinating for one obvious reason: several leaks point to the Meta Quest 4 shipping in 2026. If Meta wants to court this new casual-streamer dad group, then I'd be shocked if Meta didn't try to boost the Quest 4 resolution enough to make it tempting as a TV alternative. Either that or try and make it light enough that it's more comfortable to wear for a 2-hour movie streaming session.</p>

<p>Speculation aside, this talk made it clear that Pruett wants to debunk the idea that Horizon Worlds, Gorilla Tag, and traditional Quest games can't co-exist.</p><p>"Our commitment to continuing to grow the ecosystem is unwavering, but we’re learning in real time," Pruett said. He urged developers to get in touch with Meta and share their experiences and expectations, and he remained optimistic that the Quest space will continue to evolve and grow — not just become a kid-dominated space where some devs can't profit.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to make the most of this Samsung deal, a trade-in is the way to go. Fortunately, the retailer is being pretty generous with the devices it accepts, giving out the full $900 of credit when you send in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Z Fold 5. Even if you can&apos;t get the max discount, phones dating back to 2020&apos;s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will ensure you $600 off, so dig up your old Samsung phones to see how much you can save.</p><p>If you can&apos;t swing the trade-in route, you&apos;ll still get $300 off the phone. That beats the current discounts offered by retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, and Samsung will even sweeten the deal by throwing in three free months of YouTube Premium and Peacock Premium streaming.</p><p>One big question remains: will the Galaxy S25 Ultra get a bigger discount when Amazon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/amazon-big-spring-sale-deals-2025">Big Spring Sale</a> kicks off on March 25th? It&apos;s too soon to say, but if you&apos;ve had your eye on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and you&apos;re ready to buy today, I wouldn&apos;t wait. </p>

<p><em>Even with a discount, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a major investment.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has equipped Pixel smartphones with its own in-house systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for four generations. While the company designs the majority of Tensor processors, it doesn't make them; instead, it chooses to outsource the fabrication of these chips to Samsung Foundry. This year that may change, as the unannounced Tensor G5 SoC will reportedly be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</p><p>TSMC is far and away the industry leader in semiconductor manufacturing, and the best smartphone processors — including the Apple A18 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> — use its flagship 3nm process node. Google will reportedly begin using TSMC's 3nm process to make its Tensor G5 processors, opening the door for big performance and quality improvements. But how big of a deal is it really to the average user?</p><p>This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-google-built-tensor-g5-3535489/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> revealed a detailed component list for the Tensor G5 SoC, shedding light on the planned changes. According to the report, these are the supposed changes Google will make to Tensor chips, starting with the Tensor G5:</p>

<p>A switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC should result in a few high-level benefits for Google. For starters, Samsung Foundry has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-next-gen-4nm-process-chip-production-reported">struggled to make smaller chips reliably at desirable yield rates</a>. Its issues designing 4nm and smaller chips have been well-documented, and it's reported that unfavorable yield rates are the reason <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">there isn't an Exynos-powered Samsung Galaxy S25 model</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, TSMC's advanced processors have been around longer, and its manufacturing processes are likely more reliable than those of Samsung Foundry. For instance, overheating was a key problem for Apple's A17 Pro chip, which was manufactured using TSMC's older 3nm process. It already worked out those kinks, and Google can reap the benefits with the Tensor G5.</p><p>As our own Jerry Hildenbrand recently unpacked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nanometers-explained-why-node-size-matters">3nm processors can fit more components or run more efficiently</a> than larger SoCs. However, it's often the other kinds of engineering work that make a tangible difference. That's why Google's component swaps rumored for the Tensor G5 could make all the difference.</p>
<h2 id="what-may-change-with-the-tensor-g5-2">What may change with the Tensor G5</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung-fabricated Tensor processors often use off-the-shelf components manufactured by the South Korean company to fill in the gaps between Google's custom designs. With the TSMC-fabricated Tensor G5, Google is taking the opportunity to design more of its own components.</p><p>The most eye-catching part of the leaked spec sheet is certainly the Google-design image-signal processor (ISP) set to become part of the Tensor G5 chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ISPs are responsible for processing the information coming in from a phone's camera lenses, and they are crucial to getting great-quality photos and videos. A bad ISP can cause excellent camera lenses to produce poor output and vice versa. As such, we might be able to expect better photos and videos from the same camera hardware with the Tensor G5 chip and beyond.</p><p>Older Pixel phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4-powered Pixel 9</a>, used Samsung-designed ISPs with small Google tweaks. Now that Google is purportedly developing a custom ISP from start to finish, it's likely that future Pixel flagships will have hardware and software stacks that are better optimized, at least where the cameras are concerned.</p><p>Additionally, Google is reportedly replacing Samsung-made controllers — like the USB and display controllers — with licensed parts from companies such as Synaptics. This could give the company more or less flexibility in tweaking and optimizing how they work with Pixel hardware, depending on how they are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="what-wouldn-t-change-with-the-tensor-g5-2">What wouldn't change with the Tensor G5</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m7ZEgmEamVVUGYiDhqRRzj" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the display sizes of the Google Pixel 9 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m7ZEgmEamVVUGYiDhqRRzj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason why you might think a switch to TSMC isn't a big deal is that there are a few major holdovers from the Samsung Foundry era. While the GPU included in the Tensor G5 is predicted to be the Imagination Technologies DXT, the CPU will still feature Arm Cortex cores. Aside from the bump that comes with moving from a 4nm to a 3nm process, that means the Tensor G5 could perform similarly to older generations.</p><p>The Tensor G5's audio processor, memory controller, digital signal processor, and tensor processing unit will all still be custom components designed by Google. The latter two components are tabbed to be next-generation versions specifically for the Tensor G5. As the TPU handles AI-based tasks, this could be a sign that the Tensor G5 in the Google Pixel 10 may be able to handle more AI operations on-device.</p><p>With all these holdovers, plus the same USB3 controller, it's not like Google is completely starting over with the Tensor G5 chip.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic that the switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC could give Google more flexibility in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">designing future Tensor chips</a>, including the Tensor G5, that are better optimized for Pixel phones. While it's true that Google would likely still use off-the-shelf components for some parts of the SoC, it would have more flexibility in choosing which components are best fit for Pixel hardware needs. Previously, Tensor chips seemed to default to Samsung components when a third-party option was needed.</p><p>For example, the pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller in the Tensor G5 is said to be the Faraday Technologies FTPWMTMR010. Those who aren't PWM-sensitive might not notice such a small tweak, but Pixel phones are known for having extremely low PWM frequencies. These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">can cause pain and headaches for a portion of the population</a>, and the switch from a Samsung controller to a Faraday Technologies controller could give Google the flexibility to natively offer higher PWM rates — or disable PWM altogether.</p><p>It's unclear whether Google would do something like this, but that's the dream scenario for a move such as this one. Ideally, the switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC could give Google the flexibility to identify problems with its hardware and correct them, either with off-the-shelf parts or custom components. If Google can take these kinds of steps, we'll look back on the Tensor G5 switch as a turning point for Pixel hardware.</p>

Headlining the trio is the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, coming more than a year after its predecessor was released. It promises to provide a 30% CPU boost and an almost 30% jump to the GPU, which is nice on paper and probably in practice.</p><p>Of course, these weren't the only announcements, as we also saw AYANEO, OneXSugar, and Retroid announce new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. AYANEO's introduction of the Pocket S2 comes as little surprise, seeing the original Pocket S was the first device to ship with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hgyhmPELrZSy6XZAPzs54g" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-promo-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 front view render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgyhmPELrZSy6XZAPzs54g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2077" height="1168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, this operated as the most powerful chip for Android gaming handhelds, custom driver support notwithstanding. So naturally, I'm pretty darn excited to get my hands on the Pocket S2 and see whether the G3 Gen 3 performs as well as Qualcomm claims.</p><p>However, at the same time, I've had this nagging question in the back of my mind: have we reached the point of diminishing returns? It's kind of the same feeling that I have when it comes to smartphones, as I feel that slab phones have reached their peak, which drives my commitment to foldables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR" name="ps3-on-android-1" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO with aPS3e on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, I don't feel the same when it comes to the design of gaming handhelds, as there's a lot more flexibility. But I don't actually know if we need faster and more powerful processors. Don't get me wrong, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">RPCS3 for Android</a> continues its breakneck pace in development and Winlator continues to improve; then this take will probably look pretty dumb.</p><p>Even with Nintendo doing everything it can to put a stop to Switch emulation, the fact that you can use Android to play PS3, Switch, and PC games is mind-blowing. But in order to take advantage of that, you'll need to pony up a pretty penny.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ir7p2QejToTJEwZyayzmAK" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-4.jpg" alt="Echoes of Wisdom on the Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ir7p2QejToTJEwZyayzmAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the AYANEO Pocket S Indiegogo campaign <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">started</a>, you were looking at a starting price of $399 for the 1080p base model. Currently, you can't actually buy the base model Pocket S, but before it went out of stock, you'd be looking at $559. You might know where I'm going with this, but that's more expensive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">512GB Steam Deck OLED</a>, which is quite a bit more capable than the Pocket S.</p><p>At the same time, there's AYN with its Odin 2 lineup of Android gaming handhelds, all of which are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The trio of Odin 2 models offers a variety of RAM configurations, but the base model can currently be had for $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-1.jpg" alt="Fallout 4 running on the Ayaneo Pocket S with the Steam Deck OLED" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3940" height="2216" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the company's latest handheld, the Odin 2 Portal with OLED, starts at $329. Even if you opt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal (Max)</a>, with its 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, its $499 price tag is still less than the entry-level Pocket S.</p><p>This is what worries me a bit about the status of high-end Android emulation. AYANEO didn't share pricing specifics for the Pocket S2, but considering that it's arriving with a brand-new Qualcomm chip, I suspect it'll be pretty darn expensive. And while a few design tweaks have been made, there's really not much of a compelling reason to get one unless you're a specs snob like me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aF4s984cKZgjsdKvs8eW6K" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-gc-teaser-render" alt="Retroid Pocket Flip 2 GC teaser render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aF4s984cKZgjsdKvs8eW6K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3854" height="2168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know whether the Pocket S2 will tip the scales in one direction or the other. I think that the onus is being put on what the numbers look like with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-pocket-classic-launch">Pocket Classic</a>.</p><p>The former is actually using the Snapdragon 865 from 2019, while the Classic is the first device to ship with the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2. Those are much more affordable, as Retroid is offering a bundle that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">includes both handhelds for under $330</a>. Sure, they don't have the juice to play through your PS3 library, but you're still getting an incredible experience regardless.</p><p>I'll be interested to see just how everything plays out and whether this new wave of Android handhelds brings more people into the hobby. It's wild enough to see niche companies partner with Qualcomm, but this might just be the start of something much bigger.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi's products stand on their own merit, and devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> combine class-leading cameras with a gorgeous design and long-lasting battery. But every so often, the brand sees what its rivals are doing, and just decides to <em>emulate </em>those designs. That is the case with the Xiaomi Pad 7; a mid-range Android tablet that comes with the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3, a 11.2-inch LCD panel, and 8,850mAh battery. <br><br>There is a lot to like with the Pad 7, but before we get started, we need to talk about the design; Xiaomi did such a convincing job copying the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review">iPad Air</a> that the Pad 7 looks nearly identical. I'm not kidding — even the packaging is similar to the iPad Air, and my wife just assumed it was the new iPad and not a Xiaomi tablet. Heck, even the keyboard accessory has the exact same design as the Magic Keyboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VS9MivpCYt5GJZu9qCqMoE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VS9MivpCYt5GJZu9qCqMoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 costs just ₹27,999 ($324) in India, which is a downright bargain when you consider the hardware on offer. The same model is available for £369 ($477) in the U.K., and while it is still affordable, it isn't quite as good a value — I'd suggest getting the OLED-based Honor MagicPad 2 instead.</p><p>To put things into context, the iPad Air retails for ₹59,990 ($694), which is more than double the price of the Pad 7. At £599 ($775) in the U.K., it isn't twice as high as the Pad 7 in the country, but there's still a sizable gulf between the two products.</p>
<h2 id="an-ipad-air-clone-running-android-2">An iPad Air clone running Android</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vHRSpjjQNVohwBnfZ5K8NE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHRSpjjQNVohwBnfZ5K8NE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's incredulous to me that Xiaomi was able to emulate the design of the iPad Air to such a level. Yes, I know there are only so many ways you can design a tablet with a flat profile, but the resemblance between the two is uncanny, and it's clear this is what Xiaomi set out to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3npS79XNvFfaE95FnpbBnE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3npS79XNvFfaE95FnpbBnE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 has flat sides, and coming in at 6.2mm, it is just 0.1mm thicker than the iPad Air — the difference isn't noticeable when using both products next to one another. It is 40g heavier at 500g, but you get a bigger 8,850mAh battery. The build quality is just as good, and the tablet has an aluminum construction with a balanced heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zhvoJzUDzoHXUUtMQpTekE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhvoJzUDzoHXUUtMQpTekE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Xiaomi scores an advantage is the panel; the Pad 7 has a 11.2-inch IPS LCD panel, but it goes up to 144Hz, and the high refresh immediately makes a difference. It's annoying that the iPad Air misses out on this mode; the tablet is limited to 60Hz, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro</a> models hit 120Hz.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Pad 7 gets brighter with HDR content; this is only evident while streaming content via Netflix or YouTube, but it makes the tablet a great choice for consuming multimedia. There's a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the colors, and while it isn't an OLED, you get good color vibrancy and contrast levels. There's a reading mode as well, and I made good use of it in the month I tested the Pad 7.</p>

<p>The Pad 7 has decent internals thanks to the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3, but it doesn't come anywhere close to the Apple M3. Apple's silicon is leagues ahead of everything else, and the iPad Air does an incredible job with console-quality games. While the Pad 7 does a good job in its own right when it comes to gaming, it struggles with demanding titles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sQgdgoMhYN43ddJeE4V3qE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sQgdgoMhYN43ddJeE4V3qE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With quad audio drivers and good tuning, the Pad 7 delivers great onboard sound, and it does a terrific job while streaming TV shows and gaming. You get 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with the base model, and that's good enough, if a little annoying that the 128GB model uses UIFS 3.1 storage. Xiaomi also sells the tablet with 256GB of storage, and that configuration uses UFS 4.0 storage.</p>

<p>There isn't much missing with connectivity; the tablet has Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.4, and uses the USB-C 3.2 standard. The 8,850mAh battery lasts longer than the iPad Air, and there's 67W charging, with the tablet taking just over 90 minutes to charge the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dABLD7AzAMEfvWHLPLzMoE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dABLD7AzAMEfvWHLPLzMoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of what makes the iPad Air great is the vast accessory ecosystem, and Xiaomi is trying to emulate that with the Pad 7. The tablet comes with two accessories — the Focus Keyboard and Focus Pen — and they're both pretty decent. The keyboard accessory has a floating mechanism that's similar to the Magic Keyboard. In fact, the design is identical to the Magic Keyboard, down to the style of the hinge at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g88oG2DSfxKnLXC3qhVFFE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g88oG2DSfxKnLXC3qhVFFE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keys have good travel, and while the keyboard on the whole is good, it doesn't quite have the same quality as the Magic Keyboard. Same with the stylus; while it is decent, it doesn't come close to the Apple Pencil.</p>
<h2 id="ultimately-it-s-all-about-the-value-2">Ultimately, it's all about the value</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="unCH69hgR7iiaZpytqkGJE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unCH69hgR7iiaZpytqkGJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 7 comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the software is pretty good. Xiaomi needs to overhaul the visuals, but the interface is fluid, and it is packed with features, including useful multitasking modes. But the biggest issue is that the software isn't anywhere as extensible as the iPad Air; the reason I use the iPad is the software ecosystem, and whether it's image or video editing tools, drawing utilities, or music production software, iPadOS has a distinct advantage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xFZaLY8VQpenjwsKBtwJFE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFZaLY8VQpenjwsKBtwJFE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That doesn't mean the Pad 7 is a bad choice; if you need a tablet to consume media and get some work done on the go, it is still a good option. It's just not as powerful as the iPad Air, but that's a criticism I can level to pretty much any Android tablet. On that note, the Pad 7 won't get as many software updates either, and Xiaomi usually tends to drag its feet in this regard anyway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f6KCSBuoi8XLLz7BxoJdKE" name="Xiaomi Pad 7" alt="Xiaomi Pad 7 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6KCSBuoi8XLLz7BxoJdKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, Xiaomi did all the right things with the Pad 7. While the design is unmissably similar to the iPad Air, there is enough differentiation on the hardware — particularly the panel — to make the tablet stand out. Also, there's no arguing that it is a much better value, and at under $400, it is one of the better choices available if you need an Android tablet.</p>

<p>YouTube users are noticing a big drop in video quality, with streams looking grainy and less sharp than usual.

Even with good internet, streams keep dropping to super low resolutions like 144p or 360p, making everything super blurry and basically unwatchable.</p><p>Attempts to manually switch to 1080p or better just lead to endless buffering, which is extra annoying when you know your internet can handle it.</p><p>YouTube’s official support team has admitted there’s a weird glitch messing with video quality.

<p>Why do smartphones have odd camera bumps when they could just have a larger battery and a flat back instead? That's the question that Google seems to answer with the Google Pixel 9a, a midranger with a 5,100mAh battery capacity and a uniform 8.9mm thickness. In some ways, Apple's latest midrange offering — the iPhone 16e — is the polar opposite of the Pixel 9a. So, how do they compare?</p><p>While some will prefer the 6.1-inch compact form factor of the iPhone 16e compared to the 6.3-inch Pixel 9a, that's where the advantages start and end. It starts at $599, putting it above the sub-$500 midrange Pixel. And despite costing less, the Google Pixel 9a seems to offer a lot more features. Let's break down the pros and cons of purchasing each just-released smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. iPhone 16e: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-on-grass" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a laying back-up on a mossy surface next to a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing I've always loved about Pixel phones is how identifiable they are, largely thanks to the unique camera bar. It's been a part of Pixel design language for multiple generations now, but it goes to the wayside with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a>. Instead, the Pixel 9a has a nearly flat composite plastic back with a slight bump for the camera lenses. The dual-camera system is positioned asymmetrically on the left side of the rear case.</p><p>It's an interesting look, likely designed to maximize internal space. However, it results in the Pixel 9a losing some of its character, and some Pixel fans might not like it. The side rails of the device use a satin metal finish, and there's a Gorilla Glass 3 covering on the front. The entire phone is protected with an IP68 dust and water-resistance rating.</p><p>In terms of size, the Pixel 9a measures 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, which is technically the same thickness as the Pixel 8a. It's important to remember that unlike the Pixel 8a, the new Pixel 9a is nearly 8.9mm thick at every point due to the lack of a camera bar. It's on the heavier side, too, weighing 185.9 grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> is similarly minimalistic, with a rectangular design and curved corners joined by a singular rear camera. While it does have a camera bump, it's still smaller than the Pixel 9a in every way. The iPhone 16e measures 146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.80mm and weighs just 167 grams. This will make the iPhone 16e feel notably more compact and lightweight than the Pixel 9a, which will be preferred by some.</p><p>The iPhone 16e also arguably features more premium materials, with a glass back and aluminum side rails.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>Looking past the large bezels, the Pixel 9a has a few key display advantages. It's larger, with a 6.3-inch pOLED panel that can switch between 60Hz and 120Hz as needed. It also has a 1080 x 2424 resolution and an impressive 2,700-nit peak brightness rating. All told, with all that and HDR support, the Google Pixel 9a should look great in most situations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is objectively using dated display technology. It finally uses an OLED display but is still limited to 60Hz refresh rates. The brightness isn't great either, with a 1,200-nit peak brightness rating. Unlike newer iPhones, the iPhone 16e doesn't have a Dynamic Island and instead uses a fairly large notch. It looks gargantuan compared to the small hole-punch cutout on the Pixel 9a.</p>

<p>As a whole, the iPhone 16e has the clear advantage of being smaller and lighter than the Pixel 9a. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9a seems to use its extra space wisely with a better display than its Apple competitor.</p>

<p>Both the Google Pixel 9a and iPhone 16e make sacrifices to hit their lower price points, but which is the more complete package?</p><p>The two phones are very similar in terms of their processor, with the Pixel 9a using the Tensor G4 chip and the iPhone 16e using the A18 chip. While the Tensor G4 processor is a worse performer than Apple's top chip, the A18 system-on-a-chip (SoC) in the iPhone 16e is a binned version with one fewer graphics core.</p><p>By comparison, the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9a is the same one found throughout the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The Apple A18 SoC could still perform better in benchmarks, but both devices will be capable of daily use. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chip</a> helps the Pixel 9a secure the software advantage with tons of Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features. On top of that, the Pixel 9a gets seven years of full OS upgrades and feature drops.</p>

<p>Both phones are expected to be battery champions, but the Pixel 9a is almost certainly the winner in capacity. It now sports a 5,100mAh battery that can last up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver enabled, according to Google. Apple says the iPhone 16e can go for 26 hours of video playback but doesn't share the exact capacity. Due to the iPhone 16e using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apples-c1-modem-in-the-iphone-16e-is-proof-that-we-dont-need-qualcomm-for-5g">Apple's first C1 cellular modem</a>, battery life is expected to be better than iPhones with Qualcomm modems.</p><p>Neither midranger has excellent charging speeds. Oddly, the iPhone 16e doesn't even support MagSafe or Qi2, meaning it is limited to slow Qi wireless charging with no magnetic alignment. The Google Pixel 9a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/does-the-google-pixel-9a-support-qi2-wireless-charging">similarly doesn't support Qi2</a> and tops out at just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-fast-is-the-google-pixel-9a-charging-speed">23W wired charging speeds</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple markets the iPhone 16e's singular rear camera as a "do-it-all" sensor that can mimic a main, telephoto, and ultrawide camera. Is that really the case? The 48MP single camera has a f/1.6 aperture and can take 2x zoom photos at optical quality with sensor crop. Anything beyond that, though, and you're using lossy digital zoom. As such, this camera might leave something to be desired for those who enjoy dedicated ultrawide and telephoto lenses.</p><p>On the front, the iPhone 16e provides a 12MP, f/1.9 camera that will be more than capable for all your selfie and video recording needs. It can even shoot 4K video at up to 60FPS, for instance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google uses two camera lenses on the Pixel 9a: a 48 MP wide camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera. Like the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a doesn't have a true telephoto camera and instead uses "Super Res Zoom" to enhance the digital zoom quality up to 8x. Beyond that, the smartphone falls back to digital zoom. Unlike the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a's dedicated ultrawide lens will let users take shots with a wider field of view.</p><p>The front-facing camera is a 13MP, f/2.2 lens with a 96.1-degree field of view. Notably, the Pixel 9a supports more advanced camera features than ever, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography support</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>Google's redesign of the Pixel 9a is somewhat controversial, and not everyone is going to like the new design. Setting that aside for a minute, it's impressive how many features Google managed to cram into a phone at this price point. At a time when Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus are all selling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">new midrangers</a> above the $500 threshold, Google is keeping the Pixel A-series phone just under it. That's an advantage that neither the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> nor the iPhone 16e have.</p><p>With that being said, the Pixel 9a is over a millimeter thicker than the iPhone 16e. It's bigger by every dimension, too. For the person that considers iOS an essential feature and prefers a compact phone, the iPhone 16e could be worth considering.</p>

<p>If there's one phone that gives the Pixel 9a stiff competition, it's the OnePlus 13R. Even with a price increase of $100 in the U.S. over the 12R, it still represents amazing value for what it offers. In this Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R comparison, one thing is obvious: the 9a is geared more toward AI, while the 13R is focused on performance.</p><p>There are a few other notable differences, too, like the more compact design and longer software support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9a</a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13R</a> has a bigger battery and extra telephoto camera. With deals happening on both phones, you might find them at similar prices at some point, so which one do you pick?</p>

<p>If you have small hands or have an affinity for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact phones</a>, you'll be drawn to the Pixel 9a. Due to the smaller display, the phone is a lot more pocketable than the 13R. It's also noticeably lighter at 186 grams. The lightweight can be partly attributed to the polycarbonate back panel. The 9a also has more pronounced rounded edges in all four corners, which should make it easier to handle.</p><p>That said, both devices feature pretty flat designs, which is something we've seen with more smartphones recently.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in the standard colors of Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as Peony and Iris. The OnePlus 13R only comes in two colors: Nebula Noir (black) and Astral Trail (cream). At 206 grams, it's a lot heavier than the 9a and larger, too, due to the massive display.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for improved water resistance. The 13R is only IP65 rated, which means it has the same dust resistance, but ingress protection is limited to "low-pressure water jets" only.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch Actua pOLED display with a Full-HD Plus resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 2,700 nits. The bezels around the display are fairly thick, which is a typical trait of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>. The 9a gets an outdated scratch protection of Gorilla Glass 3, which has been used for the past couple of generations of A series phones. The refresh rate can only vary between 60Hz to 120Hz, but nothing below.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R also has a flat display like the 9a, but it's proper flagship quality. It's a 6.78-inch screen with a higher 2,780 x 1,264 resolution, which pushes the pixel count to 450 ppi. It's also an LTPO AMOLED screen, which means the refresh rate can vary from 1Hz to 120Hz, thus helping save more power with features like always-on display. Scratch protection is also better with Gorilla Glass 7i, and it has a rated peak brightness of 4,500 nits.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQnEqWaBnQXNhiqMn7iFGJ" name="oneplus-13R-white-black-side-alert-slider-01" alt="Comparing the white and black models of the OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQnEqWaBnQXNhiqMn7iFGJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google isn't increasing the price of the Pixel 9a, which means it starts at $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You still get 8GB RAM across variants, just like before. Plus, being a Google phone, you should be able to find good carrier deals, too, if you don't want to buy unlocked in the U.S..</p><p>The 9a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-google-titan-m2-and-tensor-security-core-work">Titan M2</a> security chip. While it's not the most potent chip for heavy-duty tasks like gaming, it's more than capable of handling all the onboard AI features and casual gaming. It's certainly an improvement over the G3 that came before it.</p><p>For a small Pixel phone, the 9a will probably offer the best possible battery life. You get a pretty big 5,100mAh capacity, which Google says should last more than "30+ hours."</p><p>Fast charging is present, but it's not as quick compared to the 13R. The 9a can do up to 23W wired when using Google's 45W adapter. Wireless charging is capped at 7.5W with Qi-certified EPP chargers.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is available in just a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage for $599.99. It's currently hard to get a hold of from online retailers as of writing, so your only option may be OnePlus.com. You'll also have to buy this unlocked only in the U.S., as none of the carriers offer any subsidies on it.</p><p>The hardware is solid, though. The 13R has the very powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from Qualcomm, which can easily take on the most stressful apps and games without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, eSIM is one feature we found missing from the 13R, but the SIM slot can accept two SIM cards.</p><p>Battery life is insane, thanks to the beastly 6,000mAh capacity. In our review, the OnePlus 13R easily lasted two full days on one charge, which is pretty awesome. It misses out on wireless charging, but I don't think anyone will miss it since the phone supports 80W charging. Plus, you get the compatible charger in the box, which is not the case with the 9a.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-camera-bar" alt="Close-up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has an improved 50MP main sensor, which does a stellar job of capturing rich details and low noise in still photos. We didn't find the secondary cameras to be too impressive, though. The telephoto, while nice to have, can only do 2x optical zoom, so anything beyond that is still digital. The 16MP selfie camera is also okay and gets the job done.</p><p>The Pixel 9a lacks a telephoto, but I don't think that's a huge loss since Google is pretty good with its AI-backed processing of digital zoom. The 9a has a 48MP main camera and 13MP ultrawide. The 9a still supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus, </a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me,</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, which is the first on an A series phone. Selfies are handled by a 10.5MP sensor, which I'm sure would do just fine.</p><p>The 9a and 13R can both shoot up to 4K 60fps video with the rear camera. In terms of actual video quality and stabilization performance, we'll have to spend more time testing the 9a, but that's coming soon.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sxuahTRTNzqUxESLPdRZ" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxuahTRTNzqUxESLPdRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a supports seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates, which means you should be good until early 2032. This easily beats OnePlus' update commitment of four years. Thankfully, the phone launched in early 2025, so it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> from the get-go.</p><p>It's hard to choose between the Pixel's and OnePlus' interface since they are both really good. The 9a has a clean, bloat-free interface and will always be the first to get any new Android upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a> on the OnePlus 13R works pretty great, and there are many improvements that you'll love, especially if you're coming from an older OnePlus phone.</p><p>AI is not really the play for OnePlus, but there are a few useful AI features baked in, like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser. Google is going all-in on AI, and the Pixel 9a supports nearly every AI feature found in the Pixel 9 series, including Reimagine and Add Me. Plus, with Google's Feature Drop updates, we could see more useful AI tools added in the future.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r-which-should-you-pick-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. OnePlus 13R: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-iris-in-hand" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a held in hand, the photo taken downards to emphasize its color and size." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the majority of buyers in the U.S., the Pixel 9a is going to be the smarter choice. It should be more widely available, is cheaper, has longer software support, and is powerful enough to get by. The cameras, AI features, and wireless charging are also things that should swing votes in its favor.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R has undeniable value, but not in every country. In places like India, the 13R would probably be a better pick over the 9a, where Google's pricing strategy tends to be askew. Plus, if you want a phone for gaming, a larger and brighter screen, and insane battery life with equally insane charging speeds, the OnePlus 13R is the phone to buy.</p>

<p>At under $500, the new Google Pixel 9a looks to be one of the best value-focused midrangers available. It'll compete with higher-priced phones like the iPhone 16e and OnePlus 13R but also cheaper ones like the recently-released Nothing Phone 3a Pro. While the Phone 3a Pro might actually offer a better value proposition than the latest Pixel 9a, it works better in some regions than others.</p><p>For users in Europe or India, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro might edge out the Pixel 9a with its dedicated telephoto camera. But for everyone else, the Google Pixel 9a is more appealing, with full support for North American cellular bands. It also has a better processor, longer software support, and more AI features. Let's break down how these two midrange phones compare.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e2CGEpmTeUEKiZkLGYtGXA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-top-down" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2CGEpmTeUEKiZkLGYtGXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a> is the midrange smartphone with a design that could be better described as "nothing." With a nearly flat back and the recognizable Pixel camera bar gone, the Pixel 9a doesn't have many unique aspects of its design. It does come in four colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony. The side rails feature a satin metal finish, and the back is made out of polycarbonate plastic.</p><p>Instead of having a thinner body and a protruding camera bar, Google made the entire Pixel 9a measure 8.9mm thick, filling the extra space with a bigger battery. The phone is still more compact than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> overall, as the Pixel 9a measures 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm. However, it is noticeably thicker. At 185.9 grams, the Pixel 9a will feel significantly lighter in the hand than the Phone 3a Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Nothing Phone 3a Pro's looks aren't for everyone, it does appear to have a better design than the Pixel 9a. It features Nothing character elements like the lighted Glyph Interface and the transparent back cover. Then, there's the massive circular camera bump, which looks jarring at first but may grow on you over time. Really, these two phones' design language couldn't be more different. One is basic, and the other is striking.</p><p>With a 6.77-inch screen, the Phone 3a Pro is bigger overall than the Pixel 9a. Nothing's higher-end mid-ranger measures 163.52mm x 77.5mm x 8.39mm, meaning it somehow finds a way to remain thinner than Google's offering. At 211 grams, it's much heavier than the Pixel 9a. Google has the advantage in durability, with IP68 protection against dust and water ingress and Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro has a lesser IP64 rating and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Panda Glass covering</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch pOLED screen, and it's bigger and better than last year's model. The panel has a 1080 x 2424 resolution and can hit 120Hz refresh rates, but it isn't an LTPO display. That means it can't fluctuate smoothly between refresh rates — it can only switch between 60Hz and 120Hz. It's very bright, with 2,700 nits peak brightness.</p><p>By comparison, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a bigger screen than the Pixel 9a and uses a more advanced LTPO panel. It's a 6.77-inch LTPO OLED screen with a 2392 x 1080 resolution and HDR10 support. It beats out the Pixel 9a with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, too. For anyone with sensitive eyes, the Phone 3a Pro's 2160Hz PWM dimming will be appreciated.</p>

<p>However, one advantage of the Pixel 9a is that it isn't a giant smartphone. The more compact form factor will be loved by fans of small phones, whereas the Phone 3a Pro is ideal for people who love big screens.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JTZD98S224YP44HxTa7SVB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-in-hand" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel 9a held in hand above a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTZD98S224YP44HxTa7SVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4 chip</a> isn't as strong of a performer as the best options from Apple and Qualcomm, it's likely better than the midrange chip inside the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Nothing's midranger is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>, which is a recently refreshed processor optimized for AI. However, the Pixel 9a has the exact same Tensor G4 chip as the rest of the Google Pixel 9 series, which is a key advantage.</p><p>Additionally, our tests found that the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 in the Phone 3a Pro actually performed worse in gaming tasks than the MediaTek chip in the last-generation Phone 2a. As such, depending on your workflow, the Phone 3a Pro might not be as much of an upgrade as you may expect.</p>

<p>Battery life is a big perk of using the Pixel 9a, as it offers a 5,100mAh capacity. That's only 100mAh more than the Phone 3a Pro provides on paper, but real-world usage will be much different. With a smaller screen, the Pixel 9a's battery capacity will likely last longer than a similar-specced phone with a bigger screen. With that being said, the Phone 3a Pro's 3,000mAh capacity is no slouch.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro arguably wins the charging race with support for 50W wired charging, even if it doesn't support wireless. The Pixel 9a can only hit 23W wired charging and only supports Qi wireless instead of the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/does-the-google-pixel-9a-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2</a> spec.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-pro-cameras-and-software-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Cameras and software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-by-tree" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting upright on a mossy surface leaning against a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4Abgy8YJhp4ScmyvkaoTB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The difference-maker between these two phones may boil down to their camera systems, as the Pixel 9a has two rear cameras, whereas the Phone 3a Pro has three. Crucially, that third Phone 3a Pro sensor is a periscope telephoto lens, which makes lossless zoom shots possible. As someone who loves taking zoom shots at sporting events and concerts, the 3x optical zoom (6x with sensor crop) offered by the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a key advantage.</p><p>Google's main sensors are known for producing quality shots with the help of great computational photography, and that might help the Pixel 9a. It uses a 48MP, f/1.7 main sensor with a 1/2-inch image sensor size. That's paired with a 13MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view. This year, the Pixel 9a supports advanced camera modes, like Astrophotography.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro's main camera is a 50MP, f/1.88 sensor from Samsung, and it features a 1/1.56-inch sensor size. It's joined by a 50MP, f/2.55 periscope telephoto lens from that can do up to 3x optical periscope zoom. Rounding out the rear camera system is an 8MP, f/2.2 ultrawide camera from Sony with a 120-degree field of view.</p><p>Putting it all together, the Phone 3a Pro has the telephoto advantage, while the Pixel 9a could win with its main and ultrawide lenses. Nothing also offers a 50MP front-facing camera, while Google gives the Pixel 9a a 13MP selfie camera.</p>

<p>Google's Pixel 9a has a clear edge in terms of software, with seven years of full OS upgrades and feature drops. Meanwhile, Nothing will only give the Phone 3a Pro three years of OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. Both phones feature plenty of AI, with Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and the Nothing-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the Google Pixel 9a is likely to be the more polished option at the sub-$500 price point. It has excellent Google software and plenty of AI features, plus a reliable camera system. More importantly, users in the U.S. will notice that the Pixel 9a has full carrier support, unlike the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. As such, the Pixel 9a is the easier phone to recommend than the Phone 3a Pro, even if the latter wins a few battles on the spec sheet.</p><p>Enthusiasts will be most likely to take a chance with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It has an interesting, transparent design with a Glyph Interface made up of three lighted strips. Plus, getting a periscope telephoto lens on a midrange phone is a nice perk. With that being said, weak cellular support in the U.S. and nonexistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">Verizon support</a> will be a dealbreaker for many.</p>

After all, Google now supports Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9a-get">for seven years</a>, meaning it makes a lot of sense to hold on to your existing Pixel even if it's a bit older.</p><p>But sometimes, hardware upgrades are hard to ignore. The Pixel A-series has seen some of the best upgrades in the Pixel line over the past three years, with massively improved display refresh rates, bigger batteries, IP water and dust resistance, and powerhouse cameras in addition to the same Tensor processor as the more expensive models.</p><p>So, how has the Google Pixel 8a held up over the last year, and is it worth upgrading to the Google Pixel 9a? Let's take a look.</p>

<h2 id="design-display-and-camera-2">Design, display, and camera</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="bztYQAA8FhXFmaDC2ErWjA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-side-by-side" alt="The Porcelain, Iris, Peony, and Obsidian Google Pixel 9a stood upright against a wall showing art of a man using a Google device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bztYQAA8FhXFmaDC2ErWjA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3752" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to ignore the biggest difference between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a and Pixel 9a</a>: the design. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a review</a>, I lauded the Pixel 8a for its rounded corners and matte finish on the back. "This is a phone that's built for human hands," I said, and I meant it. The Pixel 8a's curves and overall design are a masterwork in Pixel design, and none of the Pixel 9 series phones can match it.</p><p>That includes the incredibly bland and square Google Pixel 9a's design, which is now completely flat all around except for the rounded corners. It's a travesty, in my estimation, and I'm supremely disappointed in Google's decision to ruin what was so great about the Pixel 8a. If you love the design like I do, stick with the Pixel 8a.</p><p>The trademark <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">camera bar is also gone</a>, now replaced with a pill-shaped camera cutout. I still don't get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">why Google decided the camera bar had to go</a>, but it's another terrible decision that takes away from the joy of using a Pixel.</p><p>The camera bar was more than just a trademark symbol of the Pixel. It also gave the phone a slight lift when set on a table, making it easier to pick up. Now that the Pixel 9a is completely flat, not only is it harder to pick up from a table but it's less comfortable to hold because the edges are also flat. The slightly curved edges to the back of the Pixel 8a were so much better for ergonomics.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Google Pixel 8a's design was monumentally better, with more comfortable curves and a more distinct look.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The only real advantage you'll find with the Pixel 9a's design is that it's now IP68 water and dust-resistant, a slight bump up from the IP67 of the Pixel 8a. Realistically, this doesn't change much for most people. IP67 is more than enough even for taking your phone in the pool or washing it on occasion to keep it clean. IP68 is nice, for sure, but it's not worth upgrading for.</p><p>Google also upgraded the Actua display this year, increasing the brightness from 1400 nits on the Pixel 8a to 2,700 nits on the Pixel 9a. That sounds nice on paper, and it can be great when viewing the display outdoors and in sunlight, but Google continues to ignore those of us who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a>. With a super slow 240Hz PWM rate and an extreme brightness of 2700 nits, this display will cause real pain for PWM-sensitive individuals.</p><p>The display supports 120Hz and is not LTPO, just as it wasn't on the Pixel 8a. The only real upgrade here is brightness, which may or may not make a difference for you. I never thought the Pixel 8a's display was difficult to see outside, and more brightness isn't necessarily a good thing for human eyes (although the opposite can be true, too).</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a's camera is already excellent. The Pixel 9a isn't really an upgrade here.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google swapped out the 64MP main rear camera on the Pixel 8a with a 48MP camera on the Pixel 9a. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-more-megapixels-your-phone-camera-isnt-always-good-thing-sometimes-it">More megapixels aren't always better</a>, so while this sounds like a downgrade on paper, it likely means Google made the choice for a specific reason. We haven't put the Pixel 9a's camera through the review process yet, so I can't speak on specifics, but I doubt the change in sensor will be enough to upgrade.</p><p>The Pixel 9a still has a 13MP ultrawide camera on the back next to the main sensor, as well as a 13MP front-facing camera. In other words, there's no reason to change your Pixel 8a out for a 9a just for the camera.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since Pixels were known for cutting-edge performance, but the Pixel A-series typically packs a punch because of its price tag. For $100 more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> will get you substantially better performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12r-256gb-unlocked-cool-blue/6570638.p?skuId=6570638">just $350</a> will upgrade you to a OnePlus 12R which also offers substantially better performance and faster charging than either of these phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9a is also kind of a weird upgrade over the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8a. It's slower for a lot of tasks — particularly gaming — but sees a big boost in battery life and doesn't get hot the way the Tensor G3 did. If you ever had a problem with your Pixel 8a overheating, this might be reason enough to switch.</p><p>But if performance matters to you, sticking with the Pixel 8a might be the best bet. Tensor G4 achieves better battery life and cooler performance by throttling harder when the going gets tough. That means the phone will slow down more often to keep itself cool, but it's still faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a>, for instance.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a offers better performance but the Pixel 9a promises notably better battery life.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a's real advantage is the battery life. The Pixel 9a upgrades the battery to a 5,100mAh cell, up from 4,492mAh in the Pixel 8a. Since Tensor G4 is already a slightly more battery-efficient chip, this 13% increase in battery size equates to a few hours of additional usage over the Pixel 8a.</p><p>The Pixel 8a was the first Pixel A-series in recent years with decent battery life — the Pixel 6a and 7a were downright terrible in that regard — but the Pixel 9a is the first time that we should be able to call the battery life "good" since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-review">Pixel 5a</a>. Considering the Pixel 5a "only existed to prove Pixels can actually do battery right," according to our Pixel 5a reviewer, that's a compliment for this year's Pixel 9a.</p><p>No matter if you decide to upgrade to the Pixel 9a or stick with your Pixel 8a, charging speeds are still pretty slow. At 23W, this Pixel 9a barely charges any faster than the original Google Pixel that launched in 2016.</p>

<p>Upgrading from the Pixel 8a to the Pixel 9a doesn't make much sense unless you've had serious problems with battery life or the phone overheating. While the Pixel 9a offers some nice upgrades — a bigger battery, brighter display, slight ingress protection upgrade, and a cooler processor — it does so at the expense of several other things.</p><p>It loses the ergonomic design of the Pixel 8a and ditches the camera bar for a wholly generic "modern" design, as Google called it. Tensor G4 is slower than Tensor G3, meaning gamers won't be happy with the upgrade. It's also worth noting that any new software features that some with the Pixel 9a are already on the Pixel 8a thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel Feature Drop</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is definitely a great buy for anyone coming from an older or slower phone, but for Pixel 8a owners, it just makes sense to hold on to your Pixel 8a until something truly better comes along.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Honor's resurgence in the last two years has been dominated by foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>, but the brand is doing a good job in the tablet category as well. The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-9-review">Pad 9</a> delivered a massive 12.1-inch panel and standout battery life, and it was ideally suited for consuming content on the go. Honor followed it up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Pad V9</a> last month, and it does a great job. <br><br>The brand is building on that momentum with the MagicPad 2. While you get a decent number of options these days if you want a good Android tablet, most products still come with an LCD panel. The MagicPad 2, meanwhile, has a 12.3-inch OLED panel, and that in itself is a huge differentiator. The switch to OLED means you get richer colors and excellent contrast levels, and the MagicPad 2 is an entertainment powerhouse. <br><br>There's terrific built-in sound, powerful hardware, and the tablet has excellent battery life. If you need a device to consume media on the go, the MagicPad 2 is easily the best mid-range tablet currently available.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DCAYY4eaGHfm7ZkSQFd5qA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCAYY4eaGHfm7ZkSQFd5qA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor debuted the MagicPad 2 in July 2024, and the tablet is available in select global markets. It is sold in a single 12GB/256GB model in the U.K., and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/tablets/honor-magicpad-2/buy/">retails for £399 ($518) on Honor's website</a> when you use the code <strong>APD2FE50</strong>. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-MagicPad2-12-3-inch-10050mAh-Battery/dp/B0DD45S8ZM">costs £499 ($628) on Amazon U.K.</a> as of writing. <br><br>If you're looking to pick up the tablet, I'd suggest doing so from Honor. The brand exclusively sells the white variant of the tablet on its site, and the best part is that it bundles the MagicPad 2 Smart Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Pencil 3 with all orders, which is an additional savings of £160 ($200).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6mA3wYvAQHw2BrpMuchCqA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6mA3wYvAQHw2BrpMuchCqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MagicPad 2 looks and feels like a high-end tablet, and the white color option that I'm using is fantastic. It doesn't have a glass back, with Honor instead going with a fiber material that brings down the weight. The white model has a distinct pattern that evokes memories of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-marble-odyssey-hands-on">OnePlus 11 Marble Odyssey</a>, and the satin texture is great to hold.</p>

<p>You'll notice a slight green tinge when viewing the back at an angle, and an advantage of not using a glass back is that it doesn't pick up any smudges. The mid-frame is made out of metal, and the tablet is relatively thin at just 5.8mm. Coming in at 555g, it's on the lighter side of the scale when you consider the size of the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="86Vt9B8XP45hHio7QxeopA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86Vt9B8XP45hHio7QxeopA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rear camera island doesn't draw too much attention to itself, and it doesn't protrude from the chassis, so there isn't a wobble when using it on a table. The power button is located up top, and the volume buttons are on the right, and they're easy enough to access.</p>

<p>Honor did a good job minimizing the bezels, the camera is correctly positioned along the leading edge. If anything, the only point of contention with the MagicPad 2 is that it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor — you only get a PIN or passcode unlock and face unlock. I get that using an optical fingerprint sensor adds cost to the device, but Honor should have at least bundled a fingerprint module that's baked into the power button; not having it at all is a notable omission. <br><br>Other than that, there are no problems with the design of the MagicPad 2. It feels good to hold and use, and it's thin and light enough that you don't quite realize you're using an oversized tablet.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magicpad-2-display"><span>Honor MagicPad 2: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YDrefMWSEeBzXZDnpir3zA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YDrefMWSEeBzXZDnpir3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor outfitted the MagicPad 2 with the best panel in this category; the tablet has a 12.3-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 3000 x 1920 and 144Hz refresh, and it gets HDR10. It goes up to a maximum brightness of 1600 nits, and while that's when viewing HDR content, I didn't see any problems viewing the panel outdoors. It doesn't get quite as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> — Honor doesn't use a tandem OLED — but it is still more than adequate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QU9CYf7fqqgyifwnyoPWzA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QU9CYf7fqqgyifwnyoPWzA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the inclusion of the OLED panel gives the tablet a distinct edge over just about every other mid-range Android tablet. Colors are vibrant and contrast levels are excellent, and Honor continues to lead the industry when it comes to eye protection features. The tablet gets Defocus Eyecare tech — which is on the Magic V3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> — alongside 4320Hz PWM dimming, and a blue light filter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mfkCzR5unTFZY5zgAPCbyA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mfkCzR5unTFZY5zgAPCbyA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Best of all, Honor's ebook mode is available on the tablet, and it makes the MagicPad 2 an absolute joy to use for reading books and long-form content. While I'd still choose an e-reader while traveling, the monochrome mode is significantly easier on the eyes when reading text, and I'm glad Honor retained it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o2SATJzHe7B9RLpQrp9MuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2SATJzHe7B9RLpQrp9MuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the other end of the scale, HDR content looks fabulous on the tablet, with Netflix and YouTube taking advantage of the feature. The tablet has powerful built-in sound, and it's loud and detailed enough that you don't need to use a headset or earbuds while watching a TV show or movie. Gaming is similarly enjoyable, and I didn't have any issues even in demanding titles. <br><br>Overall, the massive OLED panel and the feature-set combine to make the tablet the best in its category, and if you need a device to consume multimedia on the go, this is the best option in the mid-range category.</p>

<p>While it's not using the latest silicon, the MagicPad 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, and it does an admirable job in its own right. It handles demanding games well, and there are no problems with overheating or aggressive throttling. It comes in a solitary 12Gb/256GB configuration, and there's no way to get the 512GB model globally. <br><br>Regardless, the tablet doesn't have any shortcomings in this area, and it does a good job with routine tasks as well as intensive workloads. The tablet doesn't have cellular connectivity or NFC, but the Wi-Fi 6 modem maintains a strong signal, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. There's Bluetooth 5.3 as well, and you get AptX HD and LDAC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J5pT8Co4YHvdyGfrBp4zuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J5pT8Co4YHvdyGfrBp4zuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's an 8MP camera up front, and while it isn't noteworthy, it does a decent enough job in video calls, and that's the most I used the module. The back of the tablet houses a 13MP camera, but even entry-level phones have much better cameras, and I wouldn't advice using the one at the back of the MagicPad 2. <br><br>The MagicPad 2 comes with a 10,500mAh battery, and it easily has over ten hours of screen time between charges. That is in line with other tablets of a similar size, and there are no issues in this area. Honor bundles a 66W charger in the box, and it takes the tablet just over 100 minutes to fully charge the battery.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dE8WTstMNNELcyAPGntjzA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dE8WTstMNNELcyAPGntjzA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor sells two accessories with the tablet: the MagicPad 2 Smart Bluetooth Keyboard, and Magic Pencil 3. The keyboard accessory does a good job safeguarding the tablet, and it positions the panel at a 60-degree angle, making it convenient to use. The keys don't have backlighting, but the key travel is astonishingly good, and I was able to get a decent amount of writing done on the keyboard.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues with Bluetooth connectivity either, and it stayed paired to the tablet after setting it up. The Magic Pencil 3 is also decent, and it is good to take notes with. Handwriting recognition is decent, but it constantly corrected my name to Danish, and that just made me want to eat a pastry.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magicpad-2-software"><span>Honor MagicPad 2: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WgjPjnwTYPCVNaNotrKMuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgjPjnwTYPCVNaNotrKMuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor debuted the tablet with MagicOS 8, but it picked up an update to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based MagicOS 9.0, bringing a cleaner UI and plenty of new features. Honor is positioning AI as a key point of differentiation, and that's evident when using the tablet; with utilities like Magic Portal, real-time translations, and a suite of image-editing tools, there's a lot to like in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J55AkqLPBaUoWs7NwAixuA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J55AkqLPBaUoWs7NwAixuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor also did a good job rolling out multitasking features on the tablet, and the only quibble I have with the interface is the split notification shade. The Control Center sits to the right and houses all the toggles, and notifications get a dedicated pane. A unified solution would have been better, but it's clear that Honor wants to maintain consistency with its phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8okjZXezbXa25jwMbScZwA" name="Honor MagicPad 2" alt="Honor MagicPad 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8okjZXezbXa25jwMbScZwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no problems with the interface. The UI is fluid — thanks to the 144Hz refresh — and there's enough customizability available. The biggest issue with the tablet is that it will only get one software update and three years of security updates, and that just isn't enough in 2025. With the MagicPad 2 making the switch to MagicOS 9.0, it will not get any other platform updates, and Honor needs to change its policies.</p>

<p>I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> in this segment; it also has a sizable 12.1-inch panel, but it uses an IPS LCD instead of OLED. It has beefier hardware and better multitasking utilities, but the battery doesn't last quite as long. It is the closest alternative to the MagicPad 2, but I'd still suggest getting Honor's tablet as it has an OLED panel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magicpad-2-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor MagicPad 2: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a tablet with an OLED panel</li><li>You want good hardware</li><li>You need terrific battery life</li><li>You want useful accessories</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need reliable biometrics to unlock the tablet</li></ul>
<p>Honor got the basics right with the MagicPad 2; it has a sleek design, standout battery life, and good internals. The biggest reason to pick up this tablet over its mid-range rivals is the OLED panel; the quality of the panel combined with 144Hz refresh makes the MagicPad 2 the ultimate choice for consuming multimedia at home or the go. This alone allows the tablet to distinguish itself from its rivals, and whether you're looking to stream TV shows, movies, play games, or read ebooks, the MagicPad 2 easily gets my recommendation. <br><br>The only point of contention with the tablet is that it won't pick up any platform updates; it made the switch to the Android 15-based MagicOS, and other than three years of security patches, it won't get any other updates. Honor claimed a win by promising seven years of software updates to the Magic 7 Pro — becoming the only Chinese brand to do so — but that doesn't extend to its other devices, and it's a shame that a tablet with as great a potential is being hobbled in this way. <br><br>Even then, there isn't another device that's as good as the MagicPad 2. So if you are looking to pick up a tablet mostly to watch TV shows and movies, it is the best choice in this category.</p>

<hr>
<p>Looks like the wait for One UI 7 for people in the U.S. got longer— by three days.</p><p>While we recently learned that One UI 7 is finally arriving on Galaxy phones in the second week of April, users in the U.S., however, have to wait a couple of more days.</p><p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/">announcement post</a>, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Z Flip 6 will be getting the Android 15-based update on April 10. It makes it three days behind the global release, which is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7"> slated for April 7</a>.</p>

<p>While the reason behind the delay is unspecified, it isn’t that alarming as it is just a matter of days — and it still makes the rollout of the One UI 7 within the same week.</p><p>Other than the devices mentioned above, older devices like the Galaxy S23 series, S24 FE, S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, and tablets like Galaxy Tab S10 and Tab S9 series will be receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based update in the following weeks after the April 7 and April 10 rollouts in the corresponding regions.</p><p>Yes, the One UI 7 rollout has been significantly delayed when compared to the previous iteration rollout. While many anticipated that it would be happening alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series launch back in January, it didn’t happen, and the Korean tech giant continued rolling out the One UI 7 beta updates for the Galaxy S24 models.</p>

<ul><li>Google is taking a cue from OpenAI and making Gemini available to access without an account.</li><li>You can now use Gemini on the web without signing into your Google account for added privacy.</li><li>Some Gemini features are limited or unavailable, like chat history and file uploads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making a slight tweak to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> that will make it more like OpenAI's ChatGPT — users can now access the Gemini web client without a Google account. While not every feature is available if you use Gemini without signing in, the new functionality makes it possible to get help from Google's chatbot without tying that data to you. The tweak is only available via the web client, not the mobile apps, and was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/gemini-no-sign-in/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>Now that Google has dropped the account requirement for Gemini, navigating to the Gemini web client will bring new users straight to the chat page instead of the sign-in page. Of course, if you are signed into a Google account in your browser already, the Gemini web client will attempt to automatically sign you in. As such, opening a private browsing window may be the easiest way to use Gemini independently from your Google account.</p>

<p>The biggest limitation that comes with using Gemini without an account is being restricted to just the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. All the other models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental), Gemini Deep Research, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-use-your-search-history-to-personalize-gemini-responses">Gemini Personalization (experimental)</a>, require you to sign in to access them. This isn't exactly surprising, since some of these models are locked behind Gemini Advanced and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>.</p><p>If you try to click one of the other models without signing in, you'll be shown the following message: "Sign in to explore the newest Gemini models." Other limitations include being unable to save and view your chat history, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">the lack of file upload support</a>.</p><p>For now, it appears the Gemini mobile app on iOS and Android still requires a Google account for chatbot access.</p>

<hr>
<p>Verizon announces a major update for its customers and a select group of smartphones today (Mar. 19).</p><p>The cellular service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-customers-satellite-texting-select-android-smartphones">announced</a> it is bringing satellite texting to any device via "select" Android phones in a press release. According to Verizon, its U.S.-based customers will be the first in the nation to receive such support. The company states users can "send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks."</p><p>There is some restriction here as Verizon states this satellite capability won't hit <em>every </em>Android phone. Users with a Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> or Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting.</p><p>Verizon is starting to hammer away at these upgrades today (Mar. 19); however, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.</p><p>Verizon's EVP & president, Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, "This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are."</p>

<p>Curiously, it's unclear whether or not this satellite texting capability includes the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a>. There is no information from Verizon nor Google on this matter. Android Central has reached out to Google about this matter and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">Pixel 9a launched today</a> (Mar. 19) with a fresh new look that forgoes that thick camera bump we've become accustomed to. The phone features a battery life of up to 30 hours and rapid charging support. For $499, the Pixel 9a contains Google's latest AI features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, and more.</p><p>In other news, Google mentioned briefly about the Pixel 9 series joining Verizon's satellite messaging services during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">its March feature drop</a>. It seems things are finally in a spot where both sides can move forward and begin bringing it to consumers. Additionally, Verizon highlights its work to expand and improve the usefulness of satellite communications — such as its usage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-and-at-and-t-are-testing-satellite-based-video-calls-and-its-not-starlink">satellite-based video calls</a>.</p><p>In late February, Verizon joined AT&T in testing the first satellite-to-phone video calls using the BlueBird satellite from AST SpaceMobile. Verizon announced the test saw it placing its first-ever satellite call through this method. AST SpaceMobile said it was rolling out an on-demand direct-to-device service in the U.S. This is said to leverage Verizon and AT&T's 850MHz spectrum due to its close relation with smartphones.</p><p>There appears to be some optimism regarding satellite-based video calls; however, more testing is still required before civilians can partake.</p>

<ul><li>European Commission's preliminary findings show that Google fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on two of its major products.</li><li>Google Search page and Google Play Store seem to be favoring the tech giant's products above all the other competitors in the market.</li><li>Google responds to this by stating that, the DMA "will hurt European businesses and consumers, hinder innovation, weaken security, and degrade product quality."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today (Mar. 19), the EU Commission published its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p><p>The DMA is a legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies to make sure they're playing fair and following practices that don't favor their products over other big players on the market— levelling the playing field for other tech companies.</p><p>This Act applies to large tech giants such as Alphabet(Google's parent company), Apple, and Microsoft among others. And Google has been dealing with the heat of the EU, since March 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_811">report suggests </a>that Google Search, "self preferences" its products over others i.e., when a user searches for anything related to shopping, hotel booking, transport, or financial and sports results,<strong> </strong>the report claims that Google shows its products at the top of the results page, rather than similar services offered by third parties— making users gravitate to its websites more often. More specifically "Alphabet<strong> </strong>gives its services more prominent treatment compared to others," the report stated.</p>

<p>Secondly, the EU Commission states that Under the DMA, app developers that showcase and distribute their apps via the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play"> Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>"Whilst Alphabet can receive a fee for facilitating the initial acquisition of a new customer by an app developer via Google Play, the fees charged by Alphabet go beyond what is justified."<strong> </strong></p><p>"Alphabet charges developers a high fee over an unduly long period of time for every purchase of digital goods and services," the report claimed.</p>

<p>While this isn't the EU's final decision, these preliminary findings were enough to make Google look like they're in breach of the DMA. Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/">blog post</a> earlier today that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers."</p><p>Furthermore, Google says that if the DMA is enacted, on Google Search, those rules will make it harder for people to find the exact business/website they're looking for— in turn impacting European businesses that rely on this traffic.</p><p>"Users are so frustrated that many are resorting to clunky workarounds to get to the companies and information that they want," Google added.</p><p>Let's not forget that Google did make some changes to Google Search to comply with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-may-become-less-useful-for-trip-planning-thanks-to-the-dma">DMA back in November 2024</a>, it tested removing advanced hotel-booking features entirely in Germany, Belgium, and Estonia for a limited time.</p><p>"Those changes, and many more that we have had to make in Europe, are already causing European businesses to lose up to 30% of traffic," the tech giant explained.</p><p>Speaking about the accusations on Google Play Store, the company says that the Commission's findings on Android and Play "create a false choice between openness and security. They risk exposing people in Europe to more malware and fraud." Since Google allows developers to distribute their apps freely onto the app store, this also creates an open playground for scammers to seep in, without any control from the company.</p><p>Now the only option that Google has is to create a more closed model, much like Apple where the company reviews all the apps that go through the store, without leaving it to the developers.</p><p>That said, since this isn't the final result of the investigation, the tech giant still has time to discuss with the EU Commission and look at options that will favor both parties.</p><p>"We will keep engaging with the Commission and comply with its rules. But today’s findings now increase the risk of an even worse experience for Europeans," Google added.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm's lower-end Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset could start appearing in midrange phones next month.</li><li>A previous leak predicted the Snapdragon 8s Elite processor would launch in March 2025, but it is now expected to debut a month later.</li><li>The Snapdragon 8s Elite chip is expected to perform between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm's current generation of smartphone and tablet chips, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite has been incredibly successful. Using the company's own custom Oryon cores, phones with Snapdragon 8 Elite chips inside are significantly faster than their predecessors. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processors</a> are also quite expensive, and that's why a more affordable variant is on the horizon.</p><p>According to reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1902269621266255889" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the affordable chipset — named Snapdragon 8s Elite — will start appearing in phones starting next month. Brar claims that there will be "plenty of phones sporting it" and that the initial wave of Snapdragon 8s Elite devices will "first launch in April."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snapdragon 8s Elite is set to launch soon

Plenty of phones sporting it, first launch in April

What are your expectations with the new SoC?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902269621266255889">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This update from Brar contradicts a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1863520728752009380" target="_blank">previous claim</a> that said the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Elite would launch in March 2025. This leak, posted in December 2024, also claimed that the chip would be based on ARM, instead of the custom Oryon cores used in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon X lineups. If this is the case, the Snapdragon 8s Elite chip could perform closer in line to older Snapdragon chips rather than the newer, Oryon-based SoCs.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8s-elite-launch-soon-3536617/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, citing a January 2025 leak, notes that the Snapdragon 8s Elite could perform better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and worse than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, with performance sitting somewhere in the middle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the breakdown of cores inside the Snapdragon 8s Elite processor, the January 2025 leak predicts that the chip will include eight total cores. Of those cores, there could be a big Cortex-X4 with a clock speed of 3.21GHz, paired with three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01GHz. The rest of the cores might be efficiency cores, including two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two more unnamed 2.02GHz cores.</p><p>Of course, this is all speculation until Qualcomm or its partner OEMs officially confirm the Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset and its specs.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has published a new support document to help its Pixel phone owners with an annoying, but easy-to-fix problem (hopefully).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16048560#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro-xl%2Cpixel-pro%2Cpixel">recently updated</a> its certified screen protectors document with information on which are best for the Pixel 9 series. While many users search for the best ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">protect their devices</a> from <em>physical </em>harm, some items can hinder the performance of the display. Google says it's "Made for Google screen protectors are tested to ensure compatibility with Pixel phones."</p><p>Certain non-certified screen protectors can mess with the Fingerprint Unlock method, causing recurring failures.</p><p>Google says users looking to purchase a certified screen protector for its Pixel 9 series must ensure there are no air bubbles when applying. This may cause additional problems with the fingerprint sensor. Moreover, Google advises users to wait to setup Fingerprint Unlock until <em>after </em>the screen protector has been applied. In short, this is said to "help the sensor recognize you."</p><p>Below is a complete list of screen protector brands and product SKUs that are certified to work with the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<ul><li>BigBen: FGMGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: FGOGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: PEGLASSPIXEL9P</li><li>Case-Mate: CM053810</li><li>Cesium (Blu Element): 118-2737</li><li>Mous: TEM-A0825-CLRGLS-000-W1</li><li>OtterBox: 77-95656</li><li>Power Support: GPCK-22(SB-A080-GAGG/SMFG)</li><li>Spigen: AGL08445</li><li>Caseology: AGL08497</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114439</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200314517</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114443</li></ul>

<p>The Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro see the same supported/certified brands; however, the product SKUs differ. Consumers should look for Spigen (AGL08442), Caseology (AGL08496), and Zagg/Morphie (200114438, 200314516, and 200114442).</p><p>While these have been "tested" and "certified," Google says there's still a chance Fingerprint Unlock might have an off day. If issues persist even with one of these products, the company suggests you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/13537318#re-enroll_fingerprint">re-enroll</a> your fingerprint or switch over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/14853136">Face Unlock</a>, instead.</p><p>If you're looking for something for your Pixel 9 Pro Fold, there's a compiled list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-screen-protectors">best screen protectors</a> — which might interest you.</p><p>Meanwhile, earlier this month, Google rolled out its huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> for Pixels. There was quite a bit available for phones, such as scam detection measures for the Messages and Phone app. Google also expanded its Satellite SOS feature to more places like Europe and Canada.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nearly a week after rolling out the platform-stable Android 16 Beta 3 update, Google is fixing a few issues with a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 3.1 patch. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> on the Android Beta Program subreddit, this update is becoming available for enrolled devices now and carries a version number of <strong>BP22.250221.013</strong>. Android 16 Beta 3.1 does not include any new features, but rather includes four critical fixes, two of which that were reported by beta testers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank">Google's Issue Tracker</a>.</p><p>Among the issues fixed, the biggest one might be a problem that caused the system Settings app to crash under specific circumstances. Reported under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #403303683</u></a>, this problem caused repeated Settings crashes when a device's language was set to something other than English.</p><p>Another problem caused the screen brightness of devices running Android 16 Beta 3 to switch between app-specified brightness levels and system brightness levels. This bug was reported via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/392522561" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #392522561</u></a>, and has been fixed in Android 16 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Android 16 Beta 3.1 also includes fixes for two issues causing performance problems on devices enrolled in the Android beta. One problem resulted in excessive battery drain due to high CPU load, and another occasionally caused memory leaks in the system server, according to Google.</p><p>The update features all the changes and new capabilities introduced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">the initial Android 16 Beta 3 release</a>, which marked the first time Android 16 reached platform stability. That includes Auracast support for wireless hearing aids and accessibility features for people with low vision.</p>

The LTE Pixel Watch 2 will see the same while the O.G. device will see version BP1A.250305.019.W2.</p><p>The OTA's availability seemingly surfaced late in the day yesterday (Mar. 18). Owners of an LTE Pixel Watch 3, 2, or 1 can begin checking for the Wear OS update today. However, it might not be widespread just yet, so continue to check as we wind down the week.</p>

<p>You may remember Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> rolled out at the beginning of the month, and with came the Wear OS 5.1 update. The company dedicated a Pixel Watch-specific section that patch, with the headliner being the Loss of Pulse feature. Only for the Pixel Watch 3, Loss of Pulse will have your device automatically call emergency services if it does not detect your heartbeat and reach you for confirmation.</p><p>Of course, Google had to receive strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">approval from the FDA</a> for such a feature, which was delivered in February.</p><p>The other side of the Wear OS 5.1 update is Menstrual Cycle tracking on the Pixel Watch 3. Google states users can now log their periods, view cycle status, and see a "prediction" for the next one. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/328790190/google-pixel-watch-update-march-2025?hl=en&sjid=395091567840875735-NA">patch notes</a> detail some other additions, such as an update to Pixel Watch media controls. It states the update makes it easier "to control audio content from the watch with control types based on content being played."</p><p>Counting steps has become a little more precise with this update alongside an expansion of automatic bedtime mode for the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>However, with Wear OS 5.1 now out, we're starting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">enter a new era of updates</a> from Google, which will be slower (quarterly), but more substantial.</p>

<p>Smartwatches have tracked sleep for years, but as we see more sleep coaching, energy scores, sleep apnea detection, and general AI analysis, it's fair to question how accurate a Pixel Watch's data is compared to, say, a polysomnogram or actigraphy watch.</p><p>So I sat down with Dr. Logan Schneider — an associate professor at Stanford University and Google's clinical lead for sleep health — and had a frank discussion about the usefulness, limits, and future of smartwatch sleep tracking.</p><p>Google frequently enlists practicing doctors to work with its engineers on health and wellness features. Earlier this month, I previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">interviewed Google's clinical lead of heart health</a>, Dr. Shreibati, about Loss of Pulse and how smartwatches will eventually deliver "personalized" diagnoses for heart conditions.</p><p>In this case, Dr. Schneider, who worked on projects like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sleep-profile-launch">animal-themed sleep profiles on Fitbits</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-new-sleep-features">Soli-powered sleep tracking on the Nest Hub</a>, had plenty of insights about how clinically useful these kinds of consumer-tech devices can be compared to medical-grade tech.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-behind-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-2">The science behind smartwatch sleep tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-sleep-summary.jpeg" alt="Sleep score tile on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to studying sleep patterns on an individual or population level, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/polysomnography">polysomnograms</a> are "impractically expensive, time-consuming, and resource intensive," says Dr. Schneider.</p><p>A smartwatch is physically incapable of tracking brain waves (EEGs), eye movement, and some full-body motions that a clinical sleep study can detect. However, it does capture enough useful data to extrapolate the essentials without getting health insurance involved.</p><p>That's why Schneider saw the advent of smartwatches as an opportunity to "understand sleep in a novel way, looking at population health, looking at real world changes in sleep over time," and began reaching out to tech companies like Google. Smartwatches fill a niche that polysomnograms can't.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I asked Dr. Schneider to give a clinical run-down of how sleep tracking works. He explained how your "body's physiology and its state of motion versus immobility recapitulates what's going on in the brain" and how they can determine your "rest and digest" or "fight or flight" states as a reflection of your brain states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-sleep-sensing-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Nest Hub (2nd Gen)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Dr. Schneider helped convert this smart display into a sleep tracker </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Heart rate is an obvious tool for sleep stage approximation, but he put even more emphasis on movement tracking as a vital tool. The inactivity of deep sleep, twitchy paralysis of REM, and more frequent movement in light sleep can all be estimated by your watch's accelerometer.</p><p>False-positive movements — like when your partner shifts the bed while you're in deep sleep — can be one of the big factors when your watch gets sleep estimates wrong. That's why Schneider remains proud of their work taking the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a>'s Soli radar and turning it  into a "full body actigraph and cardiopulmonary physiology sensor that could stage sleep quite accurately" because it gets a wider view of your body.</p><p>Ultimately, Schneider believes, smartwatches "can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves."</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Schneider what, if anything, could make smartwatch sleep data better <em>without</em> EEG tech. He argued there probably isn't some "gold signal" that makes things perfect, but that isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>The main key for accuracy, he explained, is having "redundant signals." Neurologists looking for a brain issue don't go straight for the MRI or scalpel; they might test your muscular reflexes to catch a "dysfunction" first. Since there are "several different types of redundant signals of the autonomic nervous system," smartwatch brands can look at those secondary sources and get more reliable results.</p><p>We already see that with factors like heart rate variability (HRV), breathing rate, and skin temperature, as secondary information for whether your body is "normal" or if something is trending wrong.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One potentially new smartwatch metric Schneider brought up was "galvanic skin response." Essentially, if you look at your skin's sweat creation and salt content, you can determine your body's sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response and see, for instance, when your sleep state is unstable.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> have a cEDA sensor that looks at sweat levels on your skin, primarily for stress detection. That seems like a perfect fit for using sweat levels to improve sleep accuracy, but I didn't think to ask about this during the interview. Maybe we'll see this in the future!</p><p>But ultimately, it comes back to Google's PPG. He credited Google's engineers for "optimizing the signal acquisition and quality," as well as the multi-path optical sensor that ensures reliable, continuous data that approaches what you'd get from a "gold standard polysomnogram."</p><p>For what it's worth, testers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Jr4p66vSmLY">Qualified Scientist</a> say the Pixel Watch 3 is highly reliable for sleep accuracy. But Dr. Schneider still says that "there's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain."</p>
<h2 id="smartwatch-sleep-tracking-has-untapped-clinical-potential-2">Smartwatch sleep tracking has untapped clinical potential</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8" name="google-pixel-watch-3-sleep-tracking-2.jpg" alt="Sleep Tracking tile in Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Dr. Schneider about the recent trend of smartwatches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> starting to detect sleep apnea and if there are other potential sleep conditions (aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/parasomnias">parasomnias</a>) that he believes smartwatches could detect.</p><p>He very enthusiastically responded that "it could be a great opportunity for tech like this to actually pick up on" conditions like Restless Leg Syndrome and sleepwalking that can be difficult to catch in limited clinical contexts but that a smartwatch <em>will</em> detect with enough patience.</p><p>Smartwatches will need to be able to differentiate between REM behavior disorders (e.g., sleep paralysis), non-REM parasomnias ranging from sleepwalking to sleep talking and even sleep eating disorders, and seizure disorders.</p><p>Dr. Schneider seems very optimistic that watches could "pick up on interesting signals" in the future, "depending upon what set of sensors you have."</p><p>This would have a direct clinical application, too. After someone is treated for a sleep disorder, it's hard to determine if you're "truly" cured or just have "fewer episodes that you're <em>aware</em> of." A smartwatch could passively solve that mystery and give patients (and doctors) peace of mind.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a complicated relationship with sleep tracking. I wrote last year about how I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hated wearing a smartwatch to bed</a>, and I've found that seeing bad sleep data can often compound my stress. So I asked Dr. Schneider why people can't trust their own bodies to feel how tired they are.</p><p>He responded with an anecdote about a man who said he was sleeping great while not believing his wife, who said he was "dying" at night and falling asleep at the wheel.</p><p>"People are terrible estimators. And why is that? Our brain habituates to our current state of being," he explained. You can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of," and sometimes you need help recognizing that.</p><p>He believes it's worth the discomfort of a smartwatch to have this self-knowledge. And since he has to "convince people to wear a Darth Vader mask every single night" for sleep apnea, he thinks it's worth getting accustomed to <em>some</em> form factor of wearable tech to help you "figure out how you're feeling."</p><p>But if, like me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> isn't the right fit for you, then Dr. Schneider thinks you really should consider that Nest Hub radar. To which I'd say, if Google hurries up and makes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-should-build-new-nest-hub-with-gemini">3rd-gen Nest Hub with Gemini</a>, I'll consider it!</p>
