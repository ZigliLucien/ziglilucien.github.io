                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google</a> announcement event is set for August 20th, which means we&apos;re likely just weeks away from getting our first official look at the Google Pixel Watch 4. But if you don&apos;t need the latest in wearable technology, you may be wondering: what does this mean for the Pixel Watch 3? Will the top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> finally get a permanent price drop? </p><p>While one can only speculate at this point, I&apos;m using my years of experience covering launches like this to tell you exactly what you can expect when the new wearable is unveiled. After all, Google Pixel Watch 3 deals are hardly unheard-of, but things might get more interesting once the popular wearable is officially deemed "last-gen". Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Google recently confirmed that the 2025 Made by Google event will be held in New York City on August 20th. The company is already advertising the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> on its store&apos;s website, and while we&apos;ve received no <em>official </em>word on the Pixel Watch 4 just yet, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">leaks and rumors</a> suggest that the wearable will be revealed alongside the new phones during the event. </p><p>As for the specs, we don&apos;t know a lot about the new smartwatch just yet. Some credible leaks have indicated that the wearable will boast the same teardrop-inspired design as its predecessor accompanied by an increase in thickness, which could suggest a bigger battery. The Pixel Watch 4 might also have smaller bezels than the previous generation, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">another rumor</a> has suggested that the watch will boast the same Snapdragon chipset as the Pixel Watch 3. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Vista-watch-face" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 on a white counter, showing the Vista watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is also certain to be equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, which means you&apos;ll get access to all of the fancy new UI features based on Material 3 Expressive, such as scrolling animations, new color themes, and redesigned tiles that work seamlessly with the Pixel Watch&apos;s uniquely curved display. And as expected, the new OS will seamlessly incorporate all of the latest AI-boosted software features from Gemini.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 10 lineup of flagship phones, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same price tag as its predecessor, starting at $349 for the 41mm version and setting you back $399 for the 45mm watch. You can also expect a ton of preorder deals to go live once the smartwatch is revealed on August 20th.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-watch-3-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-workout-screen" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million dollar question: will the Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper when the Pixel Watch 4 is unveiled? It&apos;s hard to say with certainty, but I can make a guess based on past device launches. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>, for example, was unveiled in 2023 with a starting price of $349, but now it&apos;s widely available for as low as $249. Slap on a discount during any major sale event and you can even find the last-gen watch for as little as $145. The problem is that its last-gen status also means that the wearable can be hard to find through some retailers. Indeed, the longer you wait to buy a last-gen device, the more likely it is that the item will be out of stock when you go to make your purchase. </p><p>In other words, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily wait for an official price drop to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. Instead, simply shop for the watch during the next major sale event, such as Black Friday or one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/back-to-school">back-to-school sales</a> that are beginning to kick off across the web. After all, the Pixel Watch 3 dropped to $249.99 during Amazon Prime Day a few weeks ago, and the watch isn&apos;t even last-gen yet. I expect that record-smashing discount to return this fall, so if you don&apos;t mind waiting a bit longer, that might be the best time to buy. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="727b7f0f-2e80-4181-8f44-aa29ad304df2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apDLG7FTha4HiWLEWcBvEH.png' alt="Render of the black Google Pixel Watch 3 45mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Google Pixel Watch (for now)</strong></em></p><p>With its incredibly sleek design and a bounty of Wear OS smarts, the Google Pixel Watch 3 easily ranks among the best Android smartwatches ever built.

Probably not, but slap on a discount and it may become one of the best value devices of 2025. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the newest smart glasses from Meta and the first time the company has adopted a new brand owned by EssilorLuxottica. Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses channel the HSTN style with a unique flair, plus goodies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/preorder-now-to-get-metas-limited-edition-oakley-smart-glasses-before-everyone-else">Prizm 24K Polarized lenses</a>.</p><p>And while the upgrade to a 3K camera sounds nice on paper, the real upgrade everyone wants is better battery life. After all, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">capture high-quality video</a>, but with 30 minutes max of recording time. It's hard to tote them around all day and snap footage without having to put them back in the charging case.</p><p>The company says Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses sport double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses — specifically, 8 hours of regular usage, while Ray-Ban is only rated at 4 hours — but does that actually pan out in real life? I put both glasses to the test to see which lasted longest and if Meta's claims were true. Get ready to get excited!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-camera-lab-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Camera lab test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-boxes-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with their respective boxes and charging cases on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lab test is the theoretical battery life maximum you'll get out of these smart glasses. For this test, I put Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on a table, set the recording time for 3 minutes, and pressed the recording button. Once the glasses stopped recording, I'd press the button again to capture another video.</p><p>I repeated this process until both glasses' batteries were depleted. From there, I'd dock the glasses in the case, let it sync with the Meta AI app, then count the amount of video time recorded via each clip in the app.</p><div ><table><caption>Lab camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Video resolution</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded until battery drained</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>3K</p></td><td  ><p>35</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's clear that Meta put in some good work to optimize the battery life for Oakley Meta HSTN. The only battery life metric supplied by the company is "8 hours of average usage" on a single charge, but it doesn't specify whether it'll double the Ray-Bans' battery life for <em>specific</em>, high-power tasks.</p><p>While 50 minutes isn't quite double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses' 30-minute time, it's much closer to double than I expected. Given there's not much difference in quality when using the 3K mode, as shown by my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">Oakley Meta HSTN camera review</a>, I recommend most users keep the default 1080p setting and enjoy longer recording time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-real-world-camera-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Real-world camera test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-both" alt="Wearing transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on my head at the same time" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Meta only rates these glasses for the average usage time per charge, I spent a few days out and about with each pair of glasses to find out how accurate Meta's claims were. In this first test, my wife wore Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and I wore Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. Each was paired to a phone that we had with us, so they both had the same level of syncing and connectivity to the Meta AI app.</p><p>Every time one of us took a picture or recorded a video, the other person would do the same thing. I felt this was the most accurate way to "real world" test these glasses, as two people were wearing them full time, doing the same things.</p><div ><table><caption>Real-world camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th><th  ><p>Number of photos taken</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>75%</p></td><td  ><p>14</p></td><td  ><p>6:21 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ><p>15</p></td><td  ><p>6:09 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:09 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>36%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:00 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>0%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>26:50 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>38%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>27:55 @ 1080p</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lab tests showed a far more impressive difference between the two glasses, but more real-world usage reduces the gap quite a bit. Oakley Meta HSTN's battery life is a notable improvement over Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses when using the camera a lot, but mostly only when using the default 1080p video setting.</p><p>I'm not sure what you need to do to get to Meta's estimated 8-hour battery life, but I was never able to hit that unless I was barely using the glasses at all. Any time I specifically tried using the glasses, I found that 3-4 hours was a more reasonable expectation of battery life.</p><p>At best, Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses lasted about an hour longer than the Ray-Bans. I expected this to be better in real-world usage, especially considering the lab camera test results above. Still, it's a decent upgrade over the Ray-Bans, especially if you can get an entire hour of additional usage out of a single charge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-live-streaming-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Live streaming test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6" name="oakley-meta-hstn-with-box-02" alt="Warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its box and charging case on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Did you know you could livestream to Facebook or Instagram straight from your Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses? All you need to do is open either app, start a new live video, then follow the on-screen prompts to switch over to your glasses. You can switch between your phone's camera and the glasses camera at any time by double-pressing the capture button on your glasses.</p><p>As you might expect, livestreaming takes quite a toll on your glasses' battery life, but do the camera efficiency improvements on Oakley Meta HSTN transfer over to livestreaming? I started a live stream with each pair of glasses at 90% battery and let it run until the glasses died, checking the battery life every 10 minutes. Here are the results.</p><div ><table><caption>Instagram live streaming test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes streamed</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>39 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>12%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>48 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Based on the test, it looks like Oakley Meta HSTN can livestream for around 10-15 minutes longer than Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. Not quite the gulf in battery life between the two glasses as we saw while recording 1080p video, but it's still a nice improvement!</p><p>If you're a person who livestreams from their glasses a lot, Oakley Meta HSTN are the better choice.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-audio-playback"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Audio playback</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B" name="oakley-meta-hstn-youtube-music" alt="Streaming YouTube Music on a pair of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While you're bound to take pictures and record videos with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, the likelihood is that you'll be using it to listen to music, make phone calls, or talk to Meta AI more often.</p><p>Neither pair of glasses is designed for a single specific task for hours at a time, but I wanted to get an idea of how long you could reasonably stream music to them before they'd need a top-up. For this test, I set both glasses to 60% volume and streamed music from a YouTube Music playlist until one pair gave me the low battery warning.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at start</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>85%</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>83%</p></td><td  ><p>22%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/303057485648146/?srsltid=AfmBOooq9MsFYQ3JeDLNeQ-wpcwqz35WwiP4hnEwndCZpL4Zr6xA8l5M">Meta estimates</a> that Oakley Meta HSTN will give you 5 hours of continuous audio playback, while Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses will deliver 4 hours. Based on the numbers in my tests, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses drain at a rate of roughly 30% per hour of music streaming. Oakley Meta HSTN improves that to about 25% battery used per hour of music streaming.</p><p>That's a solid improvement, even if it means these won't be replacing your earbuds for all-day listening. At best, I can see getting 4 hours of audio playback from the Oakleys, while Ray-Bans top out at about 3 hours. Both glasses come about 1 hour short of Meta's estimates in my testing.</p><p>Querying Meta AI barely makes a dent in the battery, in my testing, and I would estimate that you would need to make hundreds of queries to drain either glasses' battery to any significant degree. Yes, this even includes using the "what do you see" type functionality where the glasses take a photo and Meta AI analyzes it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-charging-time-and-conclusion"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Charging time and conclusion</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-charging-app-01" alt="Looking at the battery life for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever your glasses' battery gets low, you'll need to dock them in the included charging case for a while to be able to use them again. While there are several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meta+ray-ban+charger&crid=3324I3MFNSBXK&sprefix=razr%2B+2024%2Caps%2C127&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">charging cable alternatives on Amazon</a>, the likelihood is that you'll charge the glasses with the included case since that can be taken anywhere.</p><p>This case works just like a charging case that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> ship with, so you'll need to occasionally charge the case itself so that it can keep your glasses juiced up. On average, the charging case can fully charge your glasses around 6 times before needing to be recharged itself. Here's how long it takes for the case to charge the glasses.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-50%</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-100%</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>18 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>40 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses charge slightly quicker than Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, but this is mainly down to battery size differences. Oakley Meta HSTN has a larger battery so, at the same charging rate, you're going to see a difference in time. That 20-minute charge will get you 2 hours of music streaming, 22 minutes of 1080p video recording time, or dozens upon dozens of photos from the Oakleys.</p><p>Music streaming time has been improved, even if these still won't last long enough to replace a full day's worth of headphone or earbud usage. Considering the gap in quality between a proper set of earbuds and these glasses, though, you're not going to want to try to jam to your favorite tunes in the highest quality on them, anyway.</p><p>Overall, Meta has improved battery life on Oakley Meta HSTN versus Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, with the biggest improvements happening while using the camera on the glasses. From longer livestreaming time to nearly double the video capture time at the same resolution, this is a great upgrade for anyone who loves using their glasses as a way to capture their world.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="53a51519-eb07-4652-a84b-cede07eebe4c">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, better battery life, higher-resolution video capture, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The devices are typically under Nothing's flagship-oriented devices (think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Phone 3</a>) in terms of specs. Where the Phone 3a Pro features the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, the "true flagship" Phone 3 picked up the newer Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. More than that, is the device's price point.</p><p>Thinking flagship, the Phone 3 debuted at $799 in the U.S. On the other hand, the 3a and 3a Pro launched for $379 and $459, respectively.</p><p>It's hard to imagine Nothing going any lower than its base 3a pricing, then you begin to wonder how specifications and how much lower things could go without losing consumers. Things could end up quite differently, though. Perhaps, what we're looking at is a change in Nothing's branding from the "a" series to "Lite" or possibly "T" (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">like OnePlus</a>).</p><p>Putting things into perspective, the OnePlus 13T sort of splits the gap in the company's recent launches, as the device sports a smaller 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, but it sports the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>For now, without concrete evidence, it's worth taking these rumors with a grain of salt.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Watch 8 Classic is no exception; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> delivers a 10% software efficiency boost, but this hasn't changed Samsung's typical 40-hour estimate.</p><p>That said, the Watch 8 Classic idles extremely well. Even with AOD and the "Hey Google" wake word active, my Watch 8 Classic lasted across two nights of sleep tracking. Dozens of Gemini commands (plus AOD) burned about 20% battery across a full afternoon, but even that put it on pace for 25 hours; with more casual usage, it lasts twice as long.</p><p>For workouts, two hours of dual-band GPS tracking and a fully bright display burned about 20% battery, so 10 hours seems like a reasonable estimate with a full charge.</p><p>You may see faster battery burn if you spend more time outdoors or use music storage.  You should upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> to guarantee more than two days per charge. But I'm happy with these results.</p><p>As for charging, it takes 90 minutes for the Watch 8 Classic to hit 100%, though you can get enough juice for sleep tracking in a short span. I appreciate that Samsung added an adaptive charging tool to keep it at 85–90% power, so overcharging doesn't ruin the capacity.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-health-fitness"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Health & fitness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The Watch 8 series added Bedtime Guidance, Vascular Load, Running Coach, and Antioxidant Index.</strong></li><li><strong>It offers plenty of sleep insights...if you can stand wearing the Classic to bed.</strong></li><li><strong>The fitness accuracy and Running Coach aren't that reliable for serious athletes.</strong></li></ul><p>Of the Watch 8 series' four exclusive health features, only one (antioxidant index) has stood out to me.

A single Tile now shows data from multiple apps, merging relevant apps and widgets in one convenient location. It spares you from having to scroll through a bunch of Tiles or scour the app drawer to find what you need, and you can customize your own.</p><p>So far, only Samsung apps have varied Tile sizes that take up half or most of the display. Google and third-party apps still require a full Tile to themselves. But I'm hoping Samsung will make this format available to other devs.</p><p>The other new tool is the Now Bar, which you trigger with a double-finger tap gesture. It pulls up contextually relevant info like your current playlist or timer onto the main watch face, or else takes you to your most recent notification if nothing is pertinent. It's another way that Samsung saves users from excess scrolling to find what they need.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-website-links" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini response with websites for a nearby restaurant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini is coming to almost all recent Wear OS watches, not just Wear OS 6.

And even if Samsung switches back to the status quo with the Galaxy Watch 9, we probably won't see a new Classic until 2027.</p><p>So it's really a simple decision. If you like the bezel and can trade in your old Classic to Samsung to cut the bill in half, I'd suggest buying the Watch 8 Classic; you may find that the new design grows on you. For others, this heavy, expensive smartwatch may be the wrong fit.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7a2885c9-e0e2-475c-a8a3-d5ceddd89e62">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster can allegedly "confirm" the Galaxy S26 Edge will feature a "larger battery" whenever Samsung debuts it next year. Rumors add that this bigger battery will occur, thanks to some new "battery material technology" that Samsung is allegedly thinking of implementing.</p><p>It also seems that Samsung isn't pulling back on its interest in creating thin (and even thinner) phones.</p><p>The post on X claims Samsung is investing resources into creating a Galaxy S26 Edge that's even thinner the S25 Edge.

The device sports a 6.7-inch display and a dual camera array (200MP primary lens), but it's main eye-catching aspect was its 5.8mm profile. The S25 Edge is slimmer than the rest of the S25 series; however, it came at the price of its battery.</p><p>There was bound to be a trade-off, and it seems the device's 3,900mAh battery was the result of thinner aspirations. Moreover, Samsung outfit the phone with a 25W wired charging adapter, which could reach 55% charge in thirty minutes.</p><p>A "larger battery" would undoubtedly help the device go for longer periods of time. How Samsung could go about this is key. Some users on X theorize Samsung might go down the silicon-carbon route with the S26 Edge. We've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">similar rumors reported earlier this year</a> from South Korea, so that's one side of the speculation.</p><p>A more recent report claims that Samsung has switched gears and is now actively chasing down a new battery material known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>." Supposedly, this material can "significantly" increase a device's battery capacity, though it's unclear as to how much that could be. It's also been stated that SUS CAN could benefit future Galaxy phones by bringing greater energy density and quickening charging speeds.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Similar to what the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">rolled out for Gemini</a> in July, Google Photos is receiving photo-to-video capabilities powered by Veo 2. This leverages Google's AI generative software to create a small animated moment out of an otherwise static photo.</p><p>Rolling out today (July 23), Google says Photos app users will notice a splash page appear that says "turn your photos into a video." Users can select a photo and then choose "subtle movements" or "I'm feeling lucky." The former is something small and light, while the latter can have your family member tossing confetti into the air or something else.</p><p>Google says these clips are six seconds long and that users can share them after creating.</p><h2 id="clips-remixes-2">Clips & Remixes</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:632px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.94%;"><img id="bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-splash" alt="Google Photos begins receiving a photo-to-video feature that lets users turn their static images into short six second clips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="632" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.30%;"><img id="drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-options" alt="Photo-to-video in Google Photos lets users choose between two options to create a quick, six second animated clip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="554" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:630px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.24%;"><img id="MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D" name="google-photos-remix-styles-selection" alt="Google Photos' Remix lets users decide which unique style they'd like AI to turn their photos into, like comic or sketch styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="630" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.36%;"><img id="nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D" name="google-photos-remix-wedding-example" alt="Google Photos introduces "Remix," a way to reimagine your photos in unique styles like animation, comic, sketch, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="534" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Similarly, users can also "save" their AI-generated clip, if they'd like, or they can "regenerate" to try something new until it's right.</p><p>Google's photo-to-video feature in its Photos app is rolling out today on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>In a similar AI-created vein, Google highlights another feature headed for devices today called "Remix." Remixing your photos lets users reimagine them in a whole new light. Think about turning your Christmas photos into an anime snapshot or a simple birthday party photo into a sketch. Google adds that users will find other options, such as "Comic" and "3D animation."</p><p>Lastly, the app can generate remixes of people and pets. Google says Remix will begin rolling out in Photos "in the next few weeks" on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>Additionally, Google reiterates that photos reimagined through Remix will be marked with a SynthID digital watermark, so others know that the content they're viewing was AI-generated. Despite rolling out officially to all users, Google warns that these features (Remix and photo-to-video) are experimental. It states the AI generation could get things wrong and encourages users to provide feedback via the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons upon generation.</p><h2 id="a-hub-for-creation-2">A Hub for Creation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.77%;"><img id="9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H" name="google-photos-create-tab-example" alt="Google is preparing a new hub for AI generative functions in its Photos app called "Create."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest features rolling out for Google Photos will fly solo for a little while; however, the company plans to introduce a new "Create" tab in August.</p><p>This tab will be featured along the bottom of the app's UI, alongside other options like "Photos," "Collection," and "Search."

With previous iterations, the cover screen was relegated to more basic games, as it was just too narrow to really enjoy much of anything else. But, unfolded? Well, then you have a tablet for a more immersive and pleasant experience.</p><p>In my time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, this has largely continued to be the case. Playing games like Threes (yes, I still play it), Balatro, and Letterlike is quick and easy to fire up and play one-handed. I even dabbled a bit with trying to use it as an awkwardly tall Game Boy for some Pokémon Pinball, but that wasn't really my cup of tea.</p><h2 id="big-and-beautiful-2">Big and beautiful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-11" alt="Backbone Pro connected to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leaning on GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, the star of the show is the inner display, which Samsung has made better than ever. There are practically no awkward crease distortions to speak of, which is nice for a change. Plus, the 8-inch OLED panel simply looks incredible, especially when playing modern games or retro games that are upscaled.</p><p>Before getting into the gameplay itself, let's talk about controls. I absolutely despise trying to play platforming games with just a touchscreen, so I have quite a collection of different phone controllers. I recently picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/">Backbone Pro</a> controller, so I connected the Fold 7 and was off to the races.</p><p>However, I quickly noticed that, unlike the Fold 6 and traditional phones, the Fold 7 is so thin that there was a gap between the phone and the back of the controller. Backbone includes a few adapters in the box to help mitigate this, but really, Bluetooth controllers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> will give the phone a bit more support on the back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-10" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4636" height="2608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to actually playing those games, the Fold 7 is a beast, and there's really no way around it. It chews through even the most demanding games found on the Play Store, but that's to be expected. Where the real strength comes through is with emulation, and for the most part, the Fold 7 doesn't disappoint here either.</p><h2 id="windows-and-playstation-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Windows and PlayStation on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4202px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-6" alt="Fallout 4 on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 via GameSir GameHub (Winlator)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4202" height="2364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't sit back and play through games for hours on end, but I did try out Fallout 4 and Hades 2 via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">GameHub (Winlator)</a>, Tears of the Kingdom via Citron, and Burnout Paradise via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">RPCSX</a>.

There's a decent chance this could be a caching issue, so I'll be taking another look to see if that's the case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4834px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-1" alt="Burnout Paradise via RPCSX on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4834" height="2719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a> with RPCSX, once I got everything set up properly, I was able to get Burnout Paradise loaded, and things were looking pretty good with around a 30fps during the opening cut scene. And then it rapidly dropped to around 10 fps before bottoming out at 0fps.</p><p>What's weird about this is that the background music was still playing, and there weren't even any audio crackles or anything to make it seem like the game was frozen. Perhaps there's some tinkering to be done, but I can only assume that it's more to do with the emulator itself, as other games I tried wouldn't even load.</p><h2 id="switching-it-up-2">Switching it up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4715px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-8" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4715" height="2652" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, it's always fun to see how well Switch games will run on new hardware.

The tipster shows that as your device's power is consumed, Google plans for the circle to recede, but it will also slowly change colors.</p><p>As your power drops, the circle changes from green to yellow (half battery/under) and finally to red (low battery).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="qQeVMDiAvCwhuYjn8T9JB4" name="google-android-os-fast-pair-battery-ui-leaked" alt="A leaked snapshot from a tipster, regarding Google's potential Fast Pair UI rework for battery notifications.

The company may have taken inspiration from its competitor for Android, but there's another thing to keep in mind: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>. During its Android 16 launch, the company highlighted its most significant Android OS redesign, nicknamed M3 Expressive. At its core, Google says it wants to craft a UI that "feels good" and "makes sense."</p><p>Google intended to help Android's UI guide users to keep them focused and engaged with what they're doing. To achieve that, M3 Expressive focuses on colors, shapes, sizes, motion, and containment.</p><p>Many of these attributes can be placed right beside this new Fast Pair battery UI change we've seen leaked. Considering Google hasn't given that particular aspect of its OS a face-lift, maybe it's finally time.</p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As Samsung parades its latest wearables around, showing off their fitness and health tracking prowess, band compatibility hasn't been discussed much.</p><p>One of the things that I loved about Samsung Galaxy Watch models was the use of standard quick-release connectors for their bands. Until the Galaxy Watch 7, you could use bands compatible with all generations, dating back to the Watch 4, Watch 3, or even the OG Galaxy Watch, allowing for seamless interchangeability across all generations leading up to the Watch 7. This was a huge advantage as it opened the door to countless options.</p><p>Disappointingly, the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic no longer use quick-release connectors. I'm really upset about it.</p><h2 id="what-purpose-does-this-move-serve-2">What purpose does this move serve?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-22" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't the only smartwatch maker that favors proprietary connectors. Google does the same with its Pixel Watch family. But the difference is, Google has always done it that way. Additionally, all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch</a> models can use interchangeable bands, as they all utilize the same connector. It presents a unified front and solidifies the Pixel Watch brand.</p><p>But I don't understand why Samsung would move away from quick-release bands after seven generations of smartwatches. Being able to use standard bands designed for another Galaxy Watch on any other model made it more cost-effective to buy a Samsung wearable. You could hold on to your old bands and reuse them, or buy previously released straps that tend to be cheaper than newly released ones. Upcycling older bands for new smartwatches is also a more sustainable approach.</p><p>According to Samsung, the change was made so the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic could sit flatter on the wrist. However, I am not sure if this small design change was worth trading in quick-release connectors. Do the benefits of a flatter fit outweigh the advantages of universal strap compatibility?</p><p>It's a change that no one really asked for, and yet, Samsung felt the need to lose what was arguably one of the best features of its wearables.</p><h2 id="is-the-new-dynamic-lug-system-better-than-quick-release-connectors-2">Is the new Dynamic Lug System better than quick-release connectors?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-dynamic-lug-system" alt="How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="634" height="356" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Dynamic Lug System, you click one button and the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">Galaxy Watch 8 band</a> pops off. Plugging a strap back in is very straightforward. You simply align the connectors and push the band in. It clicks into place swiftly. It's very much like the connectors on the Samsung Galaxy One-Click Watch bands that we've seen before.</p><p>Admittedly, the new Dynamic Lug System is quicker than quick-release pins, but there was nothing explicitly wrong with the quick-release connectors to begin with. I suppose speed matters to a lot of people, but it's only a few seconds' difference either way. Besides the flatter fit, I don't think the time difference in swapping out bands justifies such a major shift either.</p><p>I value backwards compatibility and the use of an industry standard a lot more than quicker band swap time or a thinner wearable.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-samsung-users-who-will-be-effected-by-this-2">It's not just Samsung users who will be effected by this</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is a big slice of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable pie</a>.

This is why this shift also affects other brands as well.</p><p>OnePlus, Amazfit, Garmin, Withings, and Xiaomi smartwatches all use the standard 22mm or 20mm quick-release bands that the last seven generations of Galaxy Watches used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could easily use a nice Amazfit band on your Galaxy Watch or vice versa. Everyone was happy. Either way, both sides profited from this arrangement.</p><p>Now that Samsung has moved on to a new system, consumers won't be able to enjoy as wide a pool when buying smartwatch bands. As usual, it's the consumers like me and you who lose in the end.</p><p>And what can be done about this? The brutal truth is there's not much to do besides complaining and hoping for a better future. Maybe Samsung will revert to quick-release pins with the Galaxy Watch 9, but I'm not counting on it. For now, we just have to accept it as is or buy older Galaxy wearables if this is a deal breaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="44fdffef-7e89-458f-9388-19a79a37dc0c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Switching things up</strong></em></p><p>Like it or not, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic ditches the standard quick-release bands for Samsung's proprietary Dynamic Lug ones.

The plan in question also gets you unlimited talk, text, and premium data on Verizon&apos;s legendary 5G Ultra Wideband network, plus free calls and texts to over 85 countries worldwide, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and more.</p><p>After all, there&apos;s a reason we called Visible one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> (even if it isn&apos;t technically an MVNO). And of course, there&apos;s also something really nice about making a single payment today and not worrying about your phone bill again until 2026. The choice is yours. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Joining is Samsung's executive vice president and Head of Mobile Display Product Planning Team, Hojung Lee, who states, "This new panel not only builds consumer confidence in foldable OLED durability..."</p><p>Samsung says it has conducted tests with the Fold 7's display and can report that the device can withstand 500,000 folds, up significantly from 200,000 folds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">previous Z Fold models</a>. Let's not forget about the original Galaxy Fold that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-fold-dies-after-120000-folds-cnet-torture-test">only survived 120,000 folds</a>.</p><p>The post states Samsung Display leveraged a "shock-resistant" structure for its new OLED panel, which took inspiration from bulletproof glass. The company says the elastic outer layer (the one that takes the bullet's impact energy) is the idea behind the Fold 7's Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) outer layer. Samsung says it increased this layer's thickness by roughly 50%, while also adding a new "high-elastic adhesive" to each layer of the OLED.</p><p>In short, this was designed to increase the display's "recovery" fold after fold. It seems this has worked, as Samsung taps Bureau Veritas, which conducted the inspection. According to its tests, the Fold 7's display has remained operable after 500,000 folds, which Samsung says equates to around 10 years of use for the average user.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-fold-7-has-turned-heads-2">The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has turned heads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year-expectancy drops a little for "heavy use" users, as Samsung states the Fold 7 can last roughly six years with ~200 estimated folds per day.</p><p>Samsung's been on a tear, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7">detailing the various advancements</a> taken to improve its slimmest-ever Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Last week, the company discussed what it took to make the device so sleek. Such upgrades include the phone's new 3rd generation Armor FlexHinge, which cuts down its profile by 27% and enables a flatter, more open inner display when fully opened.</p><p>The Fold 7 has achieved an 8.9mm measurement when folded, a drastic drop from its previous iterations. This was helped in part by Samsung's removal of the S Pen.</p><p>On the other hand, all of these changes have seemed to benefit Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">as a report from South Korea</a> shows the Fold 7 leading the sales charge over the Flip 7. This is the first time a Galaxy Z Fold device has led Samsung's sales for its foldable department. While the Flip is typically the one consumers reach for, the Fold 7 is carrying roughly 60% of the pre-orders this year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5649196389409786183&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&track=ac-us-2464517706506802132&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1617837727828318802&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=Samsung%20details%20how%20it%20made%20its%20slimmest%20Galaxy%20Z%20Fold%207%20and%20Z%20Flip%207&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-5445094904884312851-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-6047595860180987069&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1140351136575126786&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7170f3fe-1d43-4c6a-adb1-0fad10f15122">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vdh6Duir2Ft8yo3JpKatrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

However, some users of the ultra flagship phone are having a bitter experience with the camera after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review" target="_blank">One UI 7</a> update.</p><p>Several Galaxy S23 series users have shared their disappointment in using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> camera as the photos taken after the update are seemingly blurry, washed out, and feel less sharp (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/galaxy-s23-camera-quality-one-ui-7/">Tech-Issues Today</a>).</p><p>Some users who have installed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15" target="_blank">Android 15</a>-based One UI 7 update have taken to forums, including Reddit and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Camera-quality-degraded/td-p/20094032" target="_blank">Samsung community pages</a>, to share their frustration as their Galaxy S23 series cameras aren't clicking pictures as well as they previously did. The cameras known for showcasing vibrant colors when clicked during the day now seem dull and over-processed, and feel even worse in low-light scenarios, per those who've reported.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1m3wikq/anyone_elses_camera_just_start_washing_out_colors">Anyone else's camera just start washing out colors loke this randomly?

While some complain about the blurry images, washed-out colors (even in bright sunlight), others seem to be facing issues with the camera app too. They include slight delays when switching between modes or going back and forth between the selfie shooter or the primary cameras. And for some, the preview appears to be not loading up immediately.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1lxyvi3/camera_delay_with_oneui7">Camera Delay with OneUI7?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra">r/GalaxyS23Ultra</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>A Galaxy S23 FE user has also noted that the device's camera captures better in low light when running the One UI 6.1 update, as opposed to the latest One UI 7 update.</p><p>The publication further notes some users have come up with their own fixes like clearing the camera cache, resetting camera preferences, tweaking features like scene optimizer, experimenting with pro mode, and several similar tweaks. It appears these fixes have worked for some and varied for others.</p><p>While Samsung hasn't issued any official statement about the issue, the community moderators and support team appear to be responding to users with the aforementioned complaints to submit error reports via the Samsung Members app. It suggests Samsung may address the issues with a future update.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Most of the overall design and concept are the same, with all buttons in the same places, speakers in the same places, and even nose pads and charging bridges looking identical. The real difference is in the trademark styles between the two companies, including lenses, as well as the cameras used on the front of each.</p><p>Both glasses capture in 3:4 portrait mode, and there's no option to rotate the video. Likewise, both glasses only support 30FPS recording at this time, although the wording in the Meta AI app seems to suggest that more options might be available in the future.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Interface</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge. 50 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 4 hours per charge: 30 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 48 hours</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Prescription lens support</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>53g</p></td><td  ><p>49g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unlocking-3k-resolution"><span>Unlocking 3K resolution</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-meta-ai-app-resolution-options" alt="Changing the video recording resolution on Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNRXoz3DqhJmGsKkxoGq2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By default, Oakley Meta HSTN Smart Glasses only record at the same 1080p resolution as Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. That's probably fine for most people, and it will result in longer battery life, but I wanted to see what the maximum quality difference was between these two products.</p><p>To set the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses to 3K quality, you'll open the Meta AI app, tap the settings icon next to your Oakley glasses, tap media, select video settings, then select 3K resolution from the list. With that set, you'll get the highest resolution video possible from Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses; however, the resolution may not always be the same.

the glasses mostly look good, but they struggle to balance things out when there's too much light in a scene. The picture with the rose is a perfect example of this, as it's in broad sunlight and looks overexposed. Similarly, the second shot with the bright pink bougainvillea is both overexposed and ultra-saturated, giving it a fake look.</p><p>In general, photos are extremely saturated, bright, and <em>very</em> Instagram-worthy. That all makes sense since Meta wants you to use these for Instagram and has deep tie-ins with the social media service, so you can directly post pictures, video, and even livestream from the glasses to Instagram.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-better-but-not-by-much"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN: Better, but not by much</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hRmL4dbV7TDBA3tq8eP3RY" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-front" alt="Comparing the front of the warm white Oakley Meta HSTN with transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hRmL4dbV7TDBA3tq8eP3RY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've already taken dozens of photos and videos with Oakley Meta HSTN, and I can confidently declare that, while Meta improved video recording quality, it's not quite the leap I expected.

Filed in a New York federal court this week, Google’s lawsuit claims BadBox 2.0 infected uncertified devices—like budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming boxes</a>, tablets, and projectors—by either slipping in malware before they shipped or sneaking it in through shady apps on open-source Android systems.</p><p>The infected devices were then used to carry out widespread ad fraud and other cybercrimes. On the bright side, Google’s Ad Traffic Quality team has upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Play Protect</a> to automatically shut down any apps tied to BadBox 2.0.</p><p>Google’s lawsuit points to specific infected devices, including Android TV boxes like the X88 Pro 10, T95, MXQ Pro, and QPLOVE Q9. Human Security has shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/" target="_blank">longer list</a> for those curious.</p><h2 id="is-your-device-on-the-list-2">Is your device on the list?</h2><p>If you’re using one of those flagged devices, it’s a good idea to disconnect it immediately. According to Google, the BadBox malware hides in the background and silently fakes ad clicks without tipping you off.</p><p>The FBI has put out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605" target="_blank">public warning</a> about the scope of this threat, saying hackers are using compromised TV streamers, projectors, car infotainment systems, and even digital photo frames to break into home networks. Most of these infected devices, the agency notes, were made in China.</p><p>Hackers are slipping into home networks in two main ways: by loading malware onto devices before they’re even sold, or by sneaking it in during setup through shady apps with hidden backdoors. When these infected IoT devices go online, they can be roped into the BadBox 2.0 botnet or used as residential proxies, both of which are often tied to sketchy online activity.</p><p>Ad fraud seems to be a major issue for Google here. The company says it's stuck footing the bill for fake ad traffic while also pouring time and resources into tracking and shutting down the botnet. On top of that, Google claims the whole thing chips away at user trust, hurts its reputation, and cuts into profits.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung packed this year's Fold with enough upgrades to actually make people reconsider their usual Flip habit.</p><p>This Z Flip trend has made sense until now. The Z Fold lineup has always been nearly twice the price of the clamshell foldable. Plus, Samsung’s book-style foldables used to lag behind some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">leading foldables</a> from China in design innovation.</p><p>Still, the Z Fold 7’s current momentum isn’t all that surprising. It’s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-early-battery-impressions">big step up from the Fold 6</a>, seeing as it is noticeably thinner, lighter, and now the lightest book-style foldable out there. It’s also one of the slimmest foldables overall, and that major design overhaul is likely a big reason why more people are picking it up.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="789745c1-67d8-476e-9b83-341f4b10d184">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>For first-timers or longtime Fold users looking to upgrade, the Z Fold 7 stands out as Samsung’s strongest foldable yet in the U.S. That said, if you’ve already dropped cash on a large-screen foldable not too long ago, the $2,000 asking price might be hard to justify.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

That is, on their own. While I was thoroughly impressed by what the Buds 4 were able to offer at their price point, I couldn't help but think about the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 during my review period.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> are my go-to recommendation for value-first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds for Android</a>, and they currently cost about $150. When the OnePlus Buds 4 are at full price, they retail for $130. That isn't a lot of breathing room for OnePlus' new mid-tier earbuds.</p><p>At launch (and at the time of writing), you can use code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> to save $30 on the Buds 4 on the company's website, temporarily helping matters. With a price difference of about $50 between models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-buds-4-review">OnePlus Buds 4</a> and Buds Pro 3 can coexist. But when this deal expires, OnePlus has a problem.</p><p>At full price, I'd recommend everyone but those on the tightest of budgets spend an extra $20 on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, skipping the Buds 4. Here's why.</p><h2 id="all-the-hardware-differences-between-the-oneplus-buds-4-and-the-buds-pro-3-2">All the hardware differences between the OnePlus Buds 4 and the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-5" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 next to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a record stand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyuPXq92XDDC4McBPMucXY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the OnePlus Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 on paper, there are a boatload of similarities. Both pairs of truly wireless earbuds use drivers with an 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter. They also each have dual digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and support the same AAC, SBC, and LDAC codecs. It's possible the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 even use similar or the exact same drivers, but I can't know for sure.</p><p>A key difference between the Buds 4 and Buds Pro 3 is their frequency response, and this will be important later. The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 can reproduce sounds between 10Hz and 40KHz, whereas the Buds 4 are a bit more limited, with a frequency response of 15Hz and 40KHz. In other words, the "Pro" earbuds can physically recreate more sounds accurately than the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-1" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 3 cases next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTMhxe4Cq3a9Rj57mmq5ZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 have a more premium feel, with a faux leather case that I think makes them look better than any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market. Some might find OnePlus' faux leather looks to be tacky, and I can understand that. If you're deep in the ecosystem with a leather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, it can create a neat and cohesive experience.</p><p>They support wireless charging, which is a big omission by the OnePlus Buds 4. Overall, the OnePlus Buds 4 still look more like their Nord budget counterparts than a "Pro" pair of earbuds. They have a thicker, rectangular stem that lacks squeeze controls. Additionally, both the case and earbuds have a matte finish.</p><h2 id="how-the-oneplus-buds-4-sound-compared-to-the-buds-pro-3-2">How the OnePlus Buds 4 sound compared to the Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-3" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 compared with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wcnexhmbb98tXbF4W2shCZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With similar audio drivers and noise-canceling hardware, it's no surprise that the OnePlus Buds 4 sound very close in quality to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. Volume seems consistent against both pairs of earbuds, and they also have a strong bass representation. For some, this will be enough to make the OnePlus Buds 4 a viable alternative to the Buds Pro 3 — if you like loud, bass-heavy music, these will do the job.</p><p>Where the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 outshine the Buds 4 is in soundstage separation, clarity, and range. I mentioned the Buds Pro 3's expanded frequency response earlier, and I think you can really make it out this difference in casual listening. The low end is a bit fuller and doesn't encroach as much on the midrange space, whereas the OnePlus Buds 4 will give you similar sounds with less separation.</p><p>On top of that, the high end is way more pronounced, making it easy to enjoy the crisp sound of hitting a snare drum or cymbal separately from the rest of the instruments on the soundstage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-6" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LA9vHghmiYx2TLpinbeYKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is OnePlus Buds Pro 3 sounding slightly more polished than the Buds 4. Both are an excellent listen, and frankly, I'm impressed that the OnePlus Buds 4 got as close as they did to the Buds Pro 3 at their price point. Still, I can't help but feel like the Buds 4 can have bass that's <em>too</em> overwhelming.</p><p>Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling quality</a> is solid across both the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 and Buds 4. With three microphones per side on the Buds 4 and a real-time ANC algorithm, they should successfully block out unwanted noise while listening to music.</p><p>Both pairs of earbuds will get around four to six hours of battery life on their own, depending on your volume and whether ANC is on or off.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-nail-the-intangibles-while-the-buds-4-cut-corners-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 nail the intangibles, while the Buds 4 cut corners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-7" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 left earbuds on a shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmw2JLNXGUy8FwfonsohNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although I prefer the sound of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, the difference is probably negligible for most listeners. Where the higher-end pair pulls away from the cheaper version is in their design. The Buds Pro 3 are more compact and feature a cylindrical stem, and they're much more comfortable than the blocky stem on the Buds 4. I get a better fit and, thus, a more enjoyable experience listening to the Buds Pro 3.</p><p>The Buds Pro 3 also have better on-earbud controls than the Buds 4, at least by my standards. You squeeze the stems on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 to adjust playback or ANC modes, and swipe up or down on the front of them to raise or lower the volume.</p><p>These are more reliable and intuitive than the swipe and tap controls on the flat portion of the OnePlus Buds 4 stem. Rather than incorporate a squeeze function, the Buds 4 only use capacitive buttons with no tactile feedback.</p><p>Sometimes they're too sensitive, changing something while you're actually trying to adjust the fit of your earbuds. Other times, you have to push the side of the earbud stem hard to change the ANC mode, shoving the earbud uncomfortably in your ear.</p><h2 id="the-oneplus-buds-pro-3-are-still-the-better-value-2">The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the better value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-vs-Buds-Pro-3-4" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 on top of a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cLc2GRZKaXfwxTv4psLrJY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus upgraded the sound quality, ANC, and charging case for the Buds 4, but it may have pushed the earbuds too close to its standout Buds Pro 3. I can't imagine why you'd want to buy the Buds 4 over the Buds Pro 3 unless you can get a great deal. At their full price, I'd gladly pay an extra $20 for the Buds Pro 3, which have settled into a typical $150 price point about a year after their release.</p><p>You get a crisper and more diversified sound, a wider soundstage, better controls, and wireless charging just by going with the OnePlus Buds Pro 3. This part is a bit subjective, but I think you get a more stylish and comfortable design, too.</p><p>Originally, it was unclear where the new OnePlus Buds 4 landed in quality compared to the Buds 3 and Buds Pro 3. It looked like the Buds 4 might have the chops to beat or match the Buds Pro 3 on paper. But after spending a few weeks with both pairs of earbuds, it's clear that the Buds Pro 3 still have a clear edge. Unless you can snag the Buds 4 for $100 or less, the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 are still the best value in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless Android earbuds</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c1162bc-cffb-4a99-adbd-5dfef51635ca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwVEiC32nwm2QHvnHgrch8.jpg' alt="The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the best</strong></em></p><p>The Buds Pro 3 are still the best OnePlus earbuds you can buy, even if the similar Buds 4 made things a bit confusing.

Before the Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumor mill started ramping up, I had hope that Samsung would make things better than the last three iterations.</p><p>Needless to say, those hopes were quickly dashed as soon as we caught wind of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Fold Special Edition</a>. It too shared the same measly 4,400mAh battery that Samsung seemingly has a surplus of, or just refuses to let go of. As such, that's exactly what we've got here in the Fold 7.</p><p>Fortunately, just like the ones that came before it, battery life has been pretty solid. However, I don't suspect that to be the case for long.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-solid-for-now-2">Battery life is solid... for now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hPTSEuP9MqrqZxVdzJYzHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before I get too far ahead of myself here, let's talk about how things have been going so far. I've had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> for a little over a week, and I think things are finally starting to settle in a bit. Battery life always takes a hit over the first couple of days, between downloading apps, restoring data, and everything else in between.</p><p>Since then, I've been pretty happy with the Fold 7, as it manages to keep up with me throughout the day, even with an abhorrent sleeping pattern that starts between 7-9 and ends somewhere after 3 a.m. Obviously, some days are better than others, but that would be the case even if this were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energizeyourdevice.com/en/news/detail/">Energizer P28K</a> with its 28,000mAh battery.</p><h2 id="could-samsung-have-done-better-2">Could Samsung have done better?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Dg9yvAhLvzpXq7mUzVyDx3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Circle to Search mid-game hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dg9yvAhLvzpXq7mUzVyDx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to actual battery life, I ran two abbreviated versions of my battery-draining test. The test itself is simply playing a 4K HDR video with the screen on, and then setting hourly timers to check the battery life.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Spec</p></th><th  ><p>Setting</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Adaptive Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Off</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wi-Fi</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Light Mode</p></td><td  ><p>On</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Timeout</p></td><td  ><p>10 minutes (Max allowed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Motion smoothness</p></td><td  ><p>Adaptive</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Volume</p></td><td  ><p>50%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And instead of just running it on one screen or the other, I started the test on the cover display, and then ran it again from the big screen.  Here's how everything played out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Screen</p></th><th  ><p>Time Starting</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage</p></th><th  ><p>Difference</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover</p></td><td  ><p>12:13</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>1:13</p></td><td  ><p>62%</p></td><td  ><p>~15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Main</p></td><td  ><p>2:34</p></td><td  ><p>42%</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>3:34</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td><td  ><p>~29%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It shouldn't be too surprising that the battery drained more when performing the test from the larger main display. There are simply more pixels to power, but I did double-check my math, because I didn't expect the Fold 7 to drain twice as fast. Then again, besides being larger, the main screen also has a 2184 x 1968 resolution, compared to the 2520 x 1080 resolution of the cover display.</p><p>Although I doubt many will be watching videos under these specific circumstances, it doesn't bode well for the Fold 7's battery longevity. I'm not really surprised or disappointed in what I've seen so far, as it's just what I expected, even with the efficiency gains provided by the new chip.</p><p>Which brings me back to my concerns with Samsung opting for the 4,400mAh for another year. I think there's probably a prototype somewhere in the labs that has the same screen sizes as the Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">S Pen support</a>, flagship-level cameras, and at least a 5,000mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC" name="honor-magic-v5-side-profile-closed-render" alt="Side profile view of the Honor Magic V5 closed, showing how thin it is" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wvHmDmd8uw6hjNZABAKYdC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3017" height="1697" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why not just throw caution to the wind and release the ultimate foldable? Because the mass market dictates otherwise. There's currently a race to release the thinnest foldable possible, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-than-honors-magic-v5-test-claim-report">there seems to be a debate</a> about whether the Magic V5 holds the title or if it now belongs to Samsung. No matter who the current claim-holder actually is, these phones are razor-thin and incredible feats of technology.</p><p>But when you consider that the Magic V5 has a battery capacity that's almost 40% larger than the Fold 7, I can't help but wonder why. A lot of that has to do with much of Samsung's competition beginning to integrate "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon</a>" batteries, which support faster charging and are said to be more efficient. Samsung continues to rely on a more traditional dual-cell lithium-ion battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5tCT9gRyXJBKPPHaedeg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6034" height="2586" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I think Samsung probably took a look at where the market was trending and then used the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition as a "testing" device. Since it had a positive reception, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone makers</a> were focusing on getting thinner, that's the route that Samsung took.</p><p>As for why Samsung didn't take the leap into using a different battery technology, I don't know. There's probably a well-constructed and semi-logical answer that Samsung would give. But I'm more of the mindset that the company will do whatever it takes to avoid another Note 7 scenario, despite it being almost ten years later.</p><h2 id="the-short-term-future-looks-bleak-2">The short-term future looks bleak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-cases-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAbnagnELdGEE8ZH7Rh8To.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've made it this far without talking about wireless charging, and that's simply because I haven't been using wireless charging. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">magnetic aspect of Qi2</a> isn't built into the phone, probably for the sake of being thin. And frankly, while I own non-magnetic wireless chargers, I haven't dug one out yet for testing.</p><p>Ultimately, what makes me so disappointed with this decision has nothing to do with my <em>current</em> experiences with the Fold 7. It's all about 3 months, 6 months, or one year from now. The battery will degrade; it's just science, and it happens with every phone.

The Astra is a mid-range tablet with a stylish design that's in line with the brand's phones, and it runs the latest Qualcomm silicon alongside an 8,200mAh battery.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the Astra comes with an OLED panel. Most Android tablets continue to use an LCD panel, and you just don't get the rich contrast levels and vibrancy that an OLED delivers, so the fact that Redmagic went with OLED is enough to distinguish the Astra from its rivals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TKGggzhzAKUZ8KLNtNZhGF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKGggzhzAKUZ8KLNtNZhGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the value; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.redmagic.gg/products/redmagic-astra-gaming-tablet?variant=54565184766025">Astra starts at just $499 on Redmagic's site,</a> and that's ridiculous when you consider the hardware it's packing. The same tablet is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Astra-Gaming-Tablet-Eclipse/dp/B0F9L522JZ">listed on Amazon for $699</a>, so it's clear that Redmagic is incentivizing the launch with a decent discount on its site. The base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there's also a 16GB/512GB edition that costs $649, and a 24GB/1TB model that retails at $849.</p><h2 id="a-design-that-s-meant-to-stand-out-2">A design that's meant to stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WcpcYAmKepQe2ZffGE6rFF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WcpcYAmKepQe2ZffGE6rFF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no mistaking the fact that the Astra is a gaming tablet; it has a bold design that's similar to Redmagic's gaming phones, and it looks pretty distinctive.

The Astra has excellent in-hand feel; the sizing is just right, and it isn't uncomfortable in the least. It isn't too heavy at 370g either, and I didn't have any issues using the tablet for hours on end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Tp8i8aTm9GMdwC3EbJxSDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tp8i8aTm9GMdwC3EbJxSDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's particularly great is that the tablet has a flat back with no camera protrusion whatsoever — just like the 10S Pro — and that alone makes it much better to use. There's no wobble when using the Astra on a table, and the 6.9mm width along the sides along with rounded edges make it easy to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JPtXrAPQmJuKscXjuoQuDF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JPtXrAPQmJuKscXjuoQuDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The build quality is excellent; the mid-frame is made out of aluminum as well, and I didn't see any problems whatsoever in the month I used the tablet. It gets IP54 ingress protection as well, and there are identical stereo channels, delivering great onboard sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JVmzzxoR5p7fv9cf6vuxHF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JVmzzxoR5p7fv9cf6vuxHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bezels are thinner than most Android tablets I used in recent months, and they're symmetrical on all sides, which is an achievement in and of itself. I like that Redmagic went with a 9.06-inch OLED panel instead of the usual 11 or 12-inch tablets that are standard; the smaller size makes the Astra that much more portable, but you still get adequate screen real estate.</p><h2 id="this-is-a-gaming-powerhouse-2">This is a gaming powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G53X6UKdcakfwjGBLd3kKF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G53X6UKdcakfwjGBLd3kKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The panel itself is fantastic; it has a resolution of 2400 x 1504, and it goes up to 165Hz refresh in select games. The OLED panel has outstanding color vibrancy and contrast, and it's a definite point of differentiation. You also get LTPO tech and 5,280Hz PWM dimming, and it gets bright enough that I didn't notice any issues even under sunlight. It's not a tandem OLED panel like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, but it is better than any other Android tablet I used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2niEv4r7RdLUuJj258qJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gaming on the Astra is a real delight, and the tablet handles demanding titles without breaking a sweat. It uses an active cooling solution (a small fan that's located at the back) alongside an innovative thermal management system, and the result is that it doesn't throttle even under load. It tends to overheat at times, but it isn't anywhere as uncomfortable as a gaming phone thanks to the larger surface area, and this was only an issue while running 3DMark's stress tests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVGEzjwmxfnqdJAkaSQ2FF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is the most affordable way to get your hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the U.S., and the gaming tablet lives up to its potential. I got the 16GB/512GB model, and I believe this is the sweet spot; all models come with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.1 storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4kgcEo85gTViwb3Nc5qHF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4kgcEo85gTViwb3Nc5qHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like Redmagic's gaming phones, the Astra delivers high refresh rate gaming in select titles, and that makes it highly enjoyable. The onboard sound gets loud and detailed, and there's a Magic Key on the side that's customizable. The tablet gets a fingerprint reader along with face unlock, and it's fast to authenticate. The vibration motor is pretty good too, and it has decent feedback.</p><p>Thanks to an 8,200mAh battery, the Astra easily lasts a few days with regular use, and it delivers nearly eight hours of gaming. It takes just over 80 minutes to charge the device thanks to 80W charging, but there isn't a charger included in the package.</p><h2 id="software-that-you-actually-want-to-use-2">Software that you actually want to use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF" name="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet" alt="Redmagic Astra Gaming Tablet review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s6HAQdehpwJk6Vae2AmcGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tablet runs Redmagic OS 10.5 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the software has good fluidity and not much in the way of overt styling. There's enough customizability should you need it, and I like that Redmagic cleaned up its interface in the last 18 months. There isn't any unnecessary AI bloat either, with Redmagic instead teaming up with Google to deliver Gemini and real-time translation and editing utilities.</p><p>The only issue is that the Astra will get just two software updates, and that limits its long-term usability. The hardware should easily last a half-decade at least without any noticeable slowdowns, and Redmagic really needs to do better.

The big-screen foldable is thinner and lighter while being more powerful, with a flagship processor and main camera. It helps Samsung pull ahead of Google in the foldable race — at least for now. While it looks like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 tops the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google will have the chance to respond with the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google recently set a launch event for Aug. 20, so the official Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveal isn't too far away. Rumors and leaks don't point to Google overhauling its next foldable to the extent Samsung just did. Still, that doesn't mean the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't be a better foldable for some people. Let's review how the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will compare to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, based on the latest speculative information available.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-in-hand-back" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5326" height="2996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event</a> penciled in for Aug. 20, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> is nearing an official launch. It'll likely be revealed on that date alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 series. The phone could be made available for pre-order that same day, with general availability beginning Aug. 28. However, it's worth noting that Google took some extra time releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> last year, so its successor may debut after the rest of the lineup.</p><p>Pricing for the new foldable is up in the air, with earlier rumors suggesting Google could shave hundreds off the sticker price. More recently, there's talk of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold keeping its $1,799 price tag. Either way, the phone will likely cost less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">you can purchase now for $1,999</a>. That gets you the base model with 256GB of memory and 12GB of RAM, and it's generally available as of July 25, 2025.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be available in two colors, Moonstone and Jade. Samsung offers the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, and Jetblack. There's also a Mint colorway exclusive to Samsung's online store.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-design-and-displays-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Design and displays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-top-bottom" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which shows off its full internal display and rear camera housing, which hosts three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSRhLoe44R6XJ2p4tiUrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike Samsung, Google is reportedly planning to keep things mostly the same on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. It'll likely have the same general form factor, an identically-sized main display, and similar dimensions compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This is reflected in leaked product renders for the device, created based on rumors and leaks. Of course, things can change, but we're not expecting many surprises when it comes to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's design.</p><p>There are a few key upgrades to point out. The cover screen may grow slightly to 6.4 inches, with the hinge assembly and bezels possibly shrinking to accommodate the larger display. It'll still be an AMOLED display panel supporting 120Hz refresh rates, but the screen's brightness capabilities will be upped to reach 3,000 nits, according to leaks. Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the first foldable IP68-certified against dust and water ingress.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-waterproof">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 does have an IP48 rating</a> for dust and water-resistance, it doesn't have the highest level of dust protection like the Pixel might. Samsung offers Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front display for extra durability, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-13" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Tent Mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main display on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will likely be the same as its predecessor, measuring 8 inches. It'll be an AMOLED panel capable of variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz and 2,700 nits of peak brightness, at least. The inner screen could come with a brightness increase to match the outer screen, but that's not confirmed.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 also has an 8-inch AMOLED screen, although the aspect ratio is closer to square than the Pixel. It supports 120Hz variable refresh rates and has a lower 2,600-nit peak brightness rating. Still, both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold will almost certainly have stunning displays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Galaxy AI image generation hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTksp9utSZfY29vDLBhQt3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless Google pulls off a miracle, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Samsung made its latest foldable just 8.9mm thick when folded, and it weighs only 215 grams. By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to measure somewhere around 10.5mm thick when folded and weigh roughly 257 grams. Those figures are based on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold dimensions, and current rumors and leaks don't point to major changes.</p><p>On one hand, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was already pretty thin, so the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't feel insanely thick. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is likely to be over a millimeter thinner than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and that difference is hard to ignore.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's possible the biggest Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold upgrade is on the inside.

The company is also reportedly switching to more custom components as part of the move, and this could come with efficiency improvements.</p><p>Regardless, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be more powerful. It is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the best-in-class processor for Android phones.

Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will get Google flair with Pixel UI.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is reportedly getting a major battery boost. It is rumored to feature a 5,015mAh capacity. Paired with a more efficient Tensor G5 platform, this could combine to make for impressive battery life gains. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400mAh battery — but it does have faster wired charging speeds.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't expected to come with any camera hardware upgrades. That would give buyers a 48MP main sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens capable of 5x optical zoom. Meanwhile, Samsung swapped the Galaxy Z Fold 7's main camera sensor for a new 200MP lens this year. It also sports a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Both phones are rumored to have 10MP front-facing cameras on both the main and cover screens.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-should-you-buy-now-or-wait-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Should you buy now or wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When considering a new foldable for 2025 and beyond, it's worth remembering that Google and Samsung aren't in sync. While Samsung just gave the Galaxy Z Fold a major overhaul this year, Google's big revamp to the Pixel Fold occurred last year. The jump from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is equivalent to the leap from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. As such, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't be a major upgrade, but that was expected.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will likely be the better device on paper, as it packs a more powerful chipset and a better main camera sensor. Additionally, it's thinner and lighter, and some would say Samsung's foldable build quality is better than Google's. The price tag starting at $2,000 means that, at the very least, there will be $200 of separation between Samsung and Google foldables.</p><p>If you're looking for a great foldable that doesn't cost you a fortune, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be the better option. It would also have the advantages of running Pixel UI, featuring a more inviting design language, and a wider display aspect ratio. Even with that in mind, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will win on the spec sheet every time.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6a75c679-08f2-461c-9640-fb43d324cecb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg' alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>An iterative upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the major leap the Galaxy Z Fold 7 was, but that's in part because its predecessor was already an outstanding device.

They always say "pending regulatory approval," but what does that really mean?</strong></em></p><p>Hi Roger, and thanks for writing in and asking! Since so many people use a wearable device for health and fitness, this is an interesting and important question.</p><p>The easy answer is that manufacturers mean what they say — they do not have approval to sell a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable</a> with a specific feature (hypothetically, say, sleep apnea detection) in all countries, so it's launching in those countries without that ability.</p><p>Often, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">approval is granted</a> and the feature comes with a software update, but not always. It's easy to blame the manufacturers; Samsung or Google should do whatever is needed to get those features out for everyone. But it's not really up to them.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-is-already-there-2">The hardware is already there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Companies usually don't make a different version of the product for different countries. If you buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a> in France and it can monitor your breathing during sleep, it could also do it in the United States as far as the hardware is concerned. Sometimes, even the software is there, buried and hidden, because it can't be used. But usually it's not.</p><p>We see phones built differently for different parts of the world, but wearables are a more integrated platform with more stringent hardware requirements, so it's best to just make them all the same. Your watch has the same chips and sensors inside as one sold anywhere else, even if the features are slightly different.</p><h2 id="blame-the-government-2">Blame the government</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-us-fda.jpg" alt="Samsung announced it has gained U.S. FDA approval for its sleep apnea detection." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcS3Cw4qo4t44gJNYZppnd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm sure every country around the world has some sort of regulatory body that governs the use of medical devices intended to be worn or implanted. Yes, if your wearable tries to detect or diagnose a specific health condition, it is considered a medical device. I'm only really familiar with how it works in the U.S., but I imagine the process is similar everywhere else.</p><p>In the U.S., if you build your own medical device, write your own software, and use it <em>yourself</em>, you do not need any sort of approval from anyone. Nobody is doing this, of course, but the provision is there because it needs to be — someone needs to test things during the product development stage.</p><p>Once you make your device or software available for others, and <em>especially</em> if you put it up for sale, you need to jump through all sorts of hoops. For health features, this means the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) decides.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/wearables-fda-and-patient-advice-what-physicians-should-know" target="_blank">FDA says</a> that any device “<em>intended for use in the diagnosis of disease of other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</em>” requires FDA approval. Wearable devices are not regulated if they are intended only for general wellness uses. <strong>All</strong> implanted devices require approval.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung just went through this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-sleep-apnea-galaxy-watch-more-users-globally">sleep apnea detection</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch</a> last fall. Originally, it was sold in the U.S. without access to this feature because — you guessed it — it required regulatory approval.</p><p>The FDA determines if the feature is accurate and consistent enough, as well as makes sure that no consumer health data can be accessed by an unauthorized party. It often sets guidelines for the marketing of the feature; in this case, you should be over the age of 22 and not be diagnosed with any respiratory illness, including sleep apnea. Of course, they can't enforce this, but once it's in print, Samsung is following the rules.</p><p>Once all this happens, we can use our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch</a> to tell us if we stop breathing during the night once we receive a software update that enables the feature.</p><h2 id="why-not-wait-until-it-s-approved-2">Why not wait until it's approved?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a simple answer — companies don't hold back products for this because they want to sell products, and you don't want to wait for it to be approved.</p><p>Most people didn't buy a Galaxy Watch only because they wanted to monitor for sleep apnea. I'd say the people who really wanted this feature are just a small percentage of users. I like it, you may like it, most people just don't care.</p><p>None of those people could have bought a Galaxy Watch if it weren't available, and would have bought a different model. Waiting until September of last year to release the device would have meant a lot of missed sales from people who didn't plan to use sleep apnea detection in the first place. That's not good for business.</p><p>It's worth noting that some companies, such as Samsung and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too" target="_blank">Apple</a>, are able to obtain approval much faster than others. It shouldn't be that way, but it is. My best guess is these large companies have a relationship with the right people and a good understanding of the entire process.</p><p>That said, there are some features, such as blood pressure monitoring, that even these companies haven't been able to weasel their way into getting FDA-approved.</p><p>If the next wearable you want launches minus a health feature or two, don't be afraid to buy it anyway. Approval is probably coming; it's just that the government only has one speed — a slow one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The AI revolution has mostly shaken up the software world, with specialized AI hardware devices flopping — we haven't forgotten the disasters that were the Humane AI Pin or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> just yet.</p><p>When a new AI device pops up, contrarians are quick to point out that it "could've been an app." Sometimes that's true, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-not-just-an-app">sometimes it's not</a>. AI voice recorders are particularly gaining traction among those who want new bleeding-edge hardware, and Plaud is leading the charge. The company's Note and NotePin devices aim to go with you daily to record conversations, meetings, and notes, transcribing them later in the Plaud app.</p><p>I wore the Plaud NotePin on my wrist for a week to figure out whether it's really a helpful companion, or an overpriced AI product that, well, could've been an app. Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="plaud-nailed-the-notepin-s-design-and-form-factor-2">Plaud nailed the NotePin's design and form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-2" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRvnDvnwdCMqD6ikw7RuBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't impressed by the respective form factors of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">AI Pin</a> or the Rabbit R1. They looked too bulky and inconvenient to wear or carry daily. With these kinds of devices, they're only useful if you <em>actually</em> want to carry them. An AI assistant or voice recorder is of no use if you forget it at home or it's buried in a bag.</p><p>Luckily, Plaud struck the right balance of utility and compactness with the NotePin. It's a small, pill-shaped device that can conform to be worn in a few different form factors. There's a smartwatch-like wristband, a lanyard necklace, a clip, and a magnetic "pin" option included in the accessory kit. It's worth noting that only the pin and clip are included with the NotePin — the other items will cost extra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-3" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MyYbKHNq7btPhr3ecmtmFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wore the wristband most often, as it's incredibly comfortable and unobtrusive for anyone used to wearing watches daily. It might look a bit strange wearing a NotePin on one wrist and a smartwatch on the other, but I did it anyway.</p><p>With up to 40 days of standby time and up to 20 hours of continuous recording, you should be able to wear your NotePin for plenty of time in between charges. I found those battery life estimates to be very generous — you will probably need to charge more often than that. But with only two hours needed to recharge, it won't be much of a hassle.</p><h2 id="plaud-s-pricing-model-is-extremely-hard-to-justify-2">Plaud's pricing model is extremely hard to justify</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-5" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ffGRcHG9c83oa9w7AuBP6E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI hardware products are extremely difficult to price out. Devices that rely on cloud servers incur ongoing costs for the companies supporting those off-device features. While subscriptions aren't fun, I actually think they're necessary for AI hardware. A product being sold with a one-time, upfront cost is almost certain to be bricked in the long run — the economics almost necessitate that.</p><p>Plaud went with the worst of both worlds for its NotePin pricing model. It has an extremely high upfront cost for what it is, retailing for $159. On top of that, you'll need to pay for a subscription to unlock all AI features beyond the initial free trial period. Plaud's AI Pro plan costs $100 per year and still comes with rate limits. The AI Unlimited tier costs $240 per year for the full, unabridged experience.</p><p>To put it lightly, this pricing model is insane. With the unlimited plan, your first year of using the NotePin would cost $399, and that's before any extra accessories. Using it beyond that would incur greater subscription fees over time.</p><p>The subscription model isn't the issue. The problem is that you can't ask customers to pay extreme hardware costs <em>and</em> subscription fees. Plaud <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">should've followed in Whoop's footsteps</a>, including the hardware for free while charging monthly for its subscription plan.</p><h2 id="the-recording-and-transcription-features-are-fine-but-not-outstanding-2">The recording and transcription features are fine, but not outstanding</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-4" alt="The Plaud AI NotePin." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJe9ZfUotMaTsYryfNBT87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't help that I wasn't blown away by Plaud's ability to record my conversations and transcribe them. The Plaud NotePin didn't do a bad job by any means, but it wasn't outstanding, and it needed to be to justify its cost.</p><p>The way it works is simple: you long-press the NotePin to start recording, press again to stop recording, and let the recording upload to the Plaud app on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. After that, it'll need to be uploaded to the cloud for processing and returned to your device.</p><p>Like anything dependent on the cloud, this will take time. While uploading and transcribing your recording, the app says it'll take "a few minutes to complete" and that it will "continue if you navigate away from this page." So, I closed the app for about 10 minutes, let Plaud do its thing, and checked back in.</p><p>Instead of seeing a summary, I received a new message stating, "The network is unstable, it may take a little longer than expected." That was unusual, so I ran an internet speed test on my phone. Sure enough, my download speed was 891Mbps at the time that message appeared, which is more than fast enough for what the Plaud app was trying to do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K" name="Plaud-AI-NotePin-Screenshot" alt="Screenshots of the Plaud app trying to transcribe my recording." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3hMTHNPEG7NzBzLsQLsp3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt like Plaud was trying to pass the buck on the user for its slow processing times, since my Wi-Fi 6E connection certainly wasn't the issue.

You could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">refurbished Pixel 7a</a> for under $200 to get the Google Recorder app for much less than a full year of paying for the Plaud NotePin and its unlimited subscription plan.</p><p>I've been a loyal Google Recorder user since 2022, when I started using it alongside the Pixel 7 series. After switching to the Plaud NotePin for a week, I don't feel a strong incentive to replace it with a Pixel for my recording needs.

It’s been a staple across Pixel releases, but its absence this time around, possibly in favor of cooler tones like Frost, points to Google leaning into a more colorful direction with its design choices.</p><p>There was talk earlier that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">might tie certain Pixel 10 colors to specific storage options</a>. The base model was rumored to stick with 128GB, while the Pixel 10 Pro could start at 256GB or higher. If that holds true, colors like Limoncello might only show up on certain configurations.

The publication was able to snag the image before the takedown occurred. Blass suggests that the device will feature a design that mirrors what Samsung launched with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. While it's a very Apple reminiscent design (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">something execs have criticised</a>), the company appears to want a continuation of it, at least for now.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE could see the same stick stabilizer to help when worn, with silicon tips, just like the Buds 3 Pro. Samsung called this a "Blade design" when the Buds 3 series launched last year.</p><p>The buds are shown off in white, although it's unclear if they will be glossy like the base Galaxy Buds 3 or more matte, like the 3 Pro. Blass didn't allege anything like specs or potential pricing. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">Galaxy Buds FE</a> debuted two years ago for $99. However, considering Samsung might pack in its Galaxy AI (and probably Gemini), there's no telling if that price will go up a little whenever it launches.</p><h2 id="fe-for-the-rest-2">FE for the rest?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.46%;"><img id="gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of the alleged Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in white with black silicon tips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gko3sMxzFDmuCLLHynGtpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1017" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also another major distinction between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">the Buds 3 Pro</a> and the base model: Samsung's blade lights. The Pro variant offers "Blade Lights" along the stabilizer that act as a bit of extra flair. Users can have these lights on continuously (stable) or have them fade in and out. Samsung's base 3 Pro doesn't offer this extra flair, so it remains to be seen <em>if </em>the Galaxy Buds 3 FE bring that in.</p><p>Although considering the "FE" tag, perhaps not. Additionally, we can likely expect the same blade design media and call controls to remain, just like its flagship counterparts.</p><p>You might've missed this, but Samsung recently dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-teases-its-new-galaxy-buds-ahead-of-launch">a pair of cheap earbuds</a>, dubbed the Galaxy Buds Core, overseas in India and other regions. It's unclear if these buds will see a global launch or make their way to the U.S., but considering we're seeing Galaxy Buds 3 FE rumors, <em>maybe </em>there are other plans.</p><p>A more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/leaked-renders-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-galaxy-s25-fe-changes-rumored">recent leak dropped renders</a> for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 FE. It seems both devices are in for some subtle design changes, such as an Infinity-U camera cutout for the Tab S11 Ultra's front camera and the potential removal of its S Pen slot on its back. For the S25 FE, it looks like Samsung is bringing its shiny silvery rings to its camera lenses, instead of the black rings like the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>There's speculation that the Korean OEM is looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">debut its tablet series "shortly"</a> following Unpacked, and this could bring the S25 FE with it. These earbuds could find their way into the mix.

Once again, the company confirms that its Made by Google event to reveal the next Pixel line will occur on August 20. What's most important in this teaser is Google's official look at the Pixel 10's design.</p><p>The header confirms the series will look pretty similar to the Pixel 9 series, boasting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">rather large camera bump</a>, flat sides, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's unclear which device Google's teasing. The model features three lenses, which could point us toward the Pixel 10 Pro or 10 Pro XL devices. However, there were rumors that the base model would grab a third lens, moving it closer to the company's higher-tier Pixels. Additionally, Google is offering an "exclusive offer" for new users who subscribe to its store's emails.</p><p>If you've freshly signed up, Google states you will receive a promotional code on August 20 (the day of the event). Its fine print adds, "Use of promo code is limited to a discount on one eligible device."

A Google spokesperson reached out to Android Central, stating, "We’re actively working to fix an issue that is affecting media playback controls on Google Maps."</p><p>We all know that Google Maps is one of the most popular navigation apps, be it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iOS handsets, allowing users to connect to their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> like YouTube Music and Spotify for easy access while navigating. The handy controls gave users the ability to play/pause music and skip or go to previous tracks. Having the music playback controls while navigating is one such convenience that Maps offers, which surprisingly has gone missing in the latest update.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/19/google-maps-media-controls/">9to5Google</a> now finds that the handy controls, normally found under the Navigation settings of the Maps app, have seemingly been removed, along with the toggle to “Show media playback controls.”</p><p>Additionally, the option to set the music streaming service is missing from the latest version of the Google Maps app. It seemingly applies to the latest v25.28 version alongside the beta 25.29 version. I couldn’t find the same, as I also checked on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> running the same stable version of Google Maps.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-not-available" alt="Google Maps without playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iV83ERnPLUQoX3t8rnbmr8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps without playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8" name="Google-Maps-media-controls-old" alt="Google Maps with playback controls settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTNR2vHfQqXTHD2jha3kp8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Google Maps with playback controls settings. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Some Android Central staff also saw that the controls are still on certain devices, while missing from others. It remains unclear whether the removal of the most popular feature from Maps was a deliberate decision or an unintended bug. The feature, however, as 9to5 notes, is still available on the latest iOS version of Google Maps.</p><p>If it isn't a bug as anticipated and is intentional, it will follow the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-officially-killed-driving-mode-after-stripping-most-of-its-features-in-2024">removal of Assistant Driving mode</a>. It was removed as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> transition, and it also featured the media control bar similar to what Google Maps offers now.</p><p>However, with the Assistant Driving mode discontinued, having playback controls on Google Maps became handy. Well, that might not be the case anymore until the next update for the app rolls out, hopefully bringing back the popular feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

If you're on the QPR Beta track, you can grab the update by jumping into Settings > System > Software updates > System update.

It gives you a full-screen zoom on the keyboard for things like emojis, letters, and numbers, making things easier to see and type, especially for those with low vision.</p><p>This update also adds handy new taskbar shortcuts. Now, when you long-press an app in the drawer, you’ll see a “pin to taskbar” option. Do the same on the taskbar itself, and you’ll get “unpin.” These shortcuts only show up in Desktop Mode.</p><p>Google announced the new beta release on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1m2kpff/android_16_qpr1_beta_3_now_available/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, and the build ID is BP31.250610.004, which includes the following fixes:</p><ul><li>An issue around RTOS task list corruption that was causing restarts.

According to a recent leak, it might stick to the same price, which is good news if you were bracing for a bump.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260" target="_blank">Dealabs</a> claims Google is sticking with last year’s smartwatch price in Europe, which probably means folks in the U.S. can expect the same treatment (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/18/pixel-watch-4-price/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This means the 41mm Pixel Watch 4 could go for €399 if you’re sticking with Wi-Fi, and €499 if you want LTE. The bigger 45mm version will likely hit €449 for Wi-Fi and €549 for LTE.</p><p>While U.S. pricing for the Pixel Watch 4 isn’t locked in yet, if history is any clue, it’ll probably match Europe’s numbers. Last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> launched at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, $399 for LTE, and both 45mm options went for $399 (Wi-Fi) and $449 (LTE). So, chances are Google sticks to that same pricing playbook this time around.</p><p>Since not much is changing under the hood based on leaks and rumors, it wouldn’t be surprising if Google leaves the price alone. Design-wise, the Pixel Watch 4 looks to keep the same circular style, just with slightly slimmer bezels.</p><h2 id="same-chip-small-tweaks-2">Same chip, small tweaks</h2><p>On the inside, the Pixel Watch 4 is said to stick with the same Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip as last year, so any performance gains will likely be minor tweaks rather than a major leap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there are a few upgrades worth noting. Leaks point to better battery life and faster charging, plus a new co-processor built to handle AI tasks more efficiently. Battery-wise, the 41mm model could jump from 307mAh to 327mAh, while the 45mm might go from 420mAh to 459mAh.</p><p>Another rumored addition to the Pixel Watch 4 is a new strength training mode. Google is also said to be working on a custom workout builder, so users can tailor routines to fit their own style.</p><p>This new setup looks aimed at giving you full control over how you train, from customizing warm-ups and cool-downs to tweaking your main workout. It’s a smarter way to train harder without pushing too far. And if you're on Fitbit Premium, you’ll probably also get AI-generated running tips that match how you run, not just some generic plan like what you get from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you’re looking to get something on the upper end of the scale, the decision comes down to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 2025 is a slightly upgraded version of Samsung’s first rugged smartwatch model launched in summer 2024, while the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the larger, highest-end version in the new standard line. The question becomes: is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 worth the extra coin? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-and-durability-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Design and durability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2339px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-18" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5V5nbUKvbDVV4ZVc9WNRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2339" height="1316" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, let’s look at, well, looks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> is the largest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch, thicker than the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. But it also happens to be a smidge lighter. Both have three buttons, including a Quick Button for accessing frequently used options.</p><p>The biggest difference is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a digital-only bezel, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic adds a rotating bezel. Considering Andrew Myrick notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">his initial Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on </a>that the rotating bezel is his favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, this will be a big deal for a lot of people like him.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-26" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) on wrist hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lc534fRH3LBgUxe4U3wDNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 comes in four titanium finishes: Silver, Gray, White, and a new one: Blue. It has a large 1.5-inch AMOLED screen housed in a squircle design that affords up to 3,000 nits peak brightness. The screen is made from sapphire crystal, and the watch itself is as rugged as they come, meeting an IP68 and an impressive 10ATM rating as well as MIL-STD-810H standards for durability.</p><p>In terms of battery life, it has a 590mAh battery, the same as the previous generation model, which means it should last about four days in power savings mode, about two with frequent workout tracking, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic comes in basic Black or White, though you can spruce it up with various band types (sport, fabric, or hybrid as well as third-party options). It employs a thin and cushioned design that has been brought over from the original Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>This squircle design change is immediately noticeable, and Myrick notes that it’s one that grew on him after he became accustomed to it with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> after wearing that model for a while. As noted, along with the Dynamic Lug System, the big differentiator is the inclusion of a handy rotating bezel on this watch.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has a smaller 1.34-inch Super AMOLED sapphire crystal display with the same 3,000 nits peak brightness. It boasts both IP68 and MIL-STD-810H certification, but it isn’t quite as water-resistant for deep diving with “only” a 5ATM rating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-custom-Tile" alt="A custom "Morning" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing alarm and reminder info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery is also smaller at 445mAh, and while Samsung doesn’t note its rated battery life, you can expect to charge it at least every day or two if it falls in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Classic</a>, which has a slightly smaller battery.</p><p>There’s an LTE option with both watches as well as Bluetooth 5.3 and NFC for tap payments. While the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 is more expensive, there are trade-in deals with older model Samsung Galaxy Watches (not the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024 at the time of this writing) that can save you a few bucks.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Specs</h2><p>Let’s look at how these two smartwatches compare when it comes to basic specs.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>Android 11.0 or higher</p></td><td  ><p>Android 11.0 or higher</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (powered by Samsung) + Samsung One UI 6 </p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6 (powered by Samsung) + Samsung One UI 6 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver, Gray, White, Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Black, White</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Swappable Band</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>590mAh</p></td><td  ><p>445mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery Life</p></td><td  ><p>Approx. 4 days in power-saving mode, up to 2 days with heavier use</p></td><td  ><p>Approx. up to 2 days</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>App</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Health</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Health</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Heart Rate Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Stress Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Blood Oxygen</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPS</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (built-in)</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (built-in)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sleep Monitoring</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>10ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mobile Pay</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wallet</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wallet</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>64GB</p></td><td  ><p>64GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>1.5 inches</p></td><td  ><p>1.34 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED</p></td><td  ><p>Super AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>480 x 480</p></td><td  ><p>438 x 438</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Peak Brightness</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p>3,000 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1mm </p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.4 x 10.6mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>60.5 grams</p></td><td  ><p>63.5 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-vs-galaxy-watch-8-classic-health-wellness-and-smarts-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Health, wellness, and smarts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jXeftT7x2icLjEGWB5qB9L" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-2025-1" alt="Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXeftT7x2icLjEGWB5qB9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the internals of these two smartwatches, what they can track and what you can do with them are pretty much identical. Both run on an Exynos W1000 processor and come loaded with Wear OS 6. Both have 64GB storage (that’s double that of the 2024 edition of the Galaxy Watch Ultra) and 2GB RAM.</p><p>Both track all the usual suspects when it comes to health, wellness, and vitals, thanks to the inclusion of a Samsung BioActive sensor. This includes workouts, calorie burn, activity levels, sleep, stress, temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, and more. They offer tailored sleep coaching, an area where Samsung has been upping the ante. This includes the ability to detect moderate to severe signs of sleep apnea.</p><p>There’s also Vascular Load tracking, which monitors your stress levels during sleep, and Antioxidant Index to measure your carotenoid levels. These relate to dietary intake and metabolism, and the data can help you make more informed lifestyle choices.</p><p>To use the latter, you need to remove the watch and place your finger on the underside sensor, which isn’t ideal, but it’s worth doing if cartenoid level measurements are important to you. High Stress Alerts will ping you if either watch notices your stress levels are too high, prompting you to take a breath. There’s also a mindfulness tracker and energy score.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Basic-Tile" alt="The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VFuKoMtoPG68CouS2yfXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The "Basic" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing Weather, Calendar, and part of the Battery widget. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Runners will love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a>, which calculates your fitness level on a scale from one to 10 and delivers a customized and personalized training plan with real-time guidance and motivational insights to help you along on your journey. Using Together, you can also challenge friends and family for further motivation. Both also incorporate dual-frequency GPS for tracking your runs, hikes, walks, cycles, and other outdoor activities.</p><p>One big update with both the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> out of the box, replacing the outdated Google Assistant smart voice assistant. With this, you can summon Gemini with natural voice commands, whether that’s to initiate a workout, check on your calendar, or simply ask questions about what’s going on around you.

But even if you have the bucks to spare, is the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 worth it?</p><p>Let’s consider your biggest upgrades with that model compared to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. It’s lighter but also thicker, has a larger display, longer battery life, and is more durable. It’s really designed to be the adventurer’s watch. So, if you’re the type of person who participates in a lot of outdoor sports, especially underwater activities, you’ll find value in it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Health-Tile" alt="The Health Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing ECG and antioxidant index" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7rPpwAjeMWuGzc5rjP7EE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The extra battery life is appreciated as well, but if you are already used to charging your smartwatch every day or two, you might be used to that routine anyway. With that said, longer battery life is always appreciated, especially on those days when you’re at 2% right before you’re about to go for a run.</p><p>Design and feature-wise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as its smaller Galaxy Watch 8 sister, is starting to look more like an Ultra model anyway, with the same cushioned and squircle design. However, there’s a key advantage with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic to keep in mind if you would use it: the rotating bezel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMobxtNkLuvh7rQkVAeaSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We haven’t yet tested the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 but based on Michael Hicks’ review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> (2024 model), if the iterative update offers even slight improvements, it won’t disappoint. He calls that model “a great smartwatch that’s enjoyable to use,” applauding how powerful and reliable it is. We also named the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">the best waterproof smartwatches</a> you can buy, and chances are the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 will take its spot on the list.</p><p>Interestingly, Hicks said last year that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra falls between casual and serious users. Given this, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is even more skewed to the casual side, but with all the same features serious users will appreciate, minus the extra battery life and durability, and with a cool rotating bezel. It’s the more elegant-looking of the two watches without sacrificing too much. So, it will likely be the preference for most users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bottom line: if you have an older model to trade in and it brings the price of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 in line with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, it’s worth considering. But it’s not necessary for most people unless you’re heavy into water and other outdoor sports, or you’re a power user where every last minute of battery life counts. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is a lovely medium that affords all the same features at a more affordable price and with a similar yet more stylish design.</p><p>If you want something smaller, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8. If you already have the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024), don’t bother upgrading just yet. It’s not a big enough jump in features to warrant it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="daa7d483-4899-4f3c-9eab-beba42584e7f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9QYyvUty8JP4cTFKaTMJN.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Only if you need it</strong></em></p><p>The biggest upgrades with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 over the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the more durable and water-resistant design, the larger screen, and the extra battery life.

The phone isn't expected for another year, but it's never too early to speculate on what may be. After all, Samsung has likely already begun work on its next flip phone.</p><p>Based solely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">our brief time with the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, it's not hard to see where the strengths and weaknesses lie. This helps us speculate the areas where we could see improvements with the Galaxy Z Flip 8, as well as places where Samsung may not change anything at all.</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Z Flip 8, and what do we want to see? Let's take a look.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-price-and-release-date"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Price and release date</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Different Colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung only just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in early July</a>, meaning we probably won't expect the Galaxy Z Flip 8 until next July. While previous summer Unpacked events took place in August, Samsung seems set on July being the new launch month for its foldables. Thus, barring any changes, we can expect a similar time frame for 2026.</p><p>As for pricing, there's no reason to believe Samsung will increase the price on the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We saw a $100 increase with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, but the Flip 7 retained the same pricing despite the new chip and larger cover screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, if Samsung continues to launch new Galaxy Z Flip FE models, we do hope that it considers lowering the price to something that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>, for example.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-specs"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Specs</span></h2><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8 (rumored/expected)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, 2520 x 1080, FHD+, Dynamic AMOLED 2X,  LTPO (1-120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>4.1-inch Super AMOLED, 60/120Hz, 948 x 1048</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 17 (One UI 9)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Exynos 2600</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front-facing Camera</p></td><td  ><p>10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,300mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 10W wireless charging, 4.5W reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>---</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-design-and-displays"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Design and displays</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mS44iNV3AmA3o353vWNB76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is known to utilize smartphone designs over multiple years. Since the company just introduced a fresh design for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, we don't expect anything drastic for 2026. The phone will likely look very similar to this year's Flip, save for some minor cosmetic changes such as new colors and slightly different dimensions.</p><p>In fact, we hope Samsung doesn't make any drastic changes, as the company has seemingly perfected the Galaxy Z Flip 7 design.</p><p>Samsung was able to shave off some millimeters on the Z Flip 7 chassis, making the phone much thinner than its predecessor and its closest competitor. We hope that the Z Flip 8 is able to retain the same thinness, even with any potential changes Samsung makes.</p><p>One small change Samsung implemented from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">Flip 5 to the Flip 6</a> was a color-matched ring around the camera lenses. Samsung could make a similar change next year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the displays are likely to remain the same. That means that Galaxy Z Flip 8 could retain the 6.9-inch primary folding display and external 4.1-inch panel. An improved hinge design has resulted in a minimal crease compared to previous generations, something we expect Samsung to continue to improve.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung may introduce different colors with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. We do hope some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 7 colors</a> remain, such as the Navy Blue and Coralred, but we would like to see other bold and vibrant colors, like the green it introduced with the Galaxy S22 series.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was a notable departure for Samsung, arriving with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> instead of the Snapdragon chip powering the rest of the company's flagship phones. Although there was no explanation provided, it's likely due to cost and efficiency considerations, given the nature of flip phones.</p><p>Because of this, we expect Samsung may stick with Exynos for the Galaxy Z Flip 8. In fact, Samsung has reportedly been working on a 2nm Exynos 2600. According to reports, it seems <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.newdaily.co.kr/site/data/html/2025/06/11/2025061100145.html">yields for the new chip are pretty high</a>, and Samsung seems confident enough in its upcoming chip that it will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-exynos-2600-benchmarks-predict-an-exciting-clash-with-snapdragon/">Early benchmarks</a> also suggest that the chip could be quite impressive, which is good news for the Galaxy Z Flip 8.</p><p>Aside from an Exynos chip, we expect the phone to feature at least 12GB of RAM to power Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. It will also likely come with 256GB and 512GB of storage, as Samsung has yet to launch a model with 1TB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-charging-port" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Charging Port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A6ELLJLDS33kzrnJ3nxXHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 received a battery increase from 4,000mAh to 4,300mAh, which is impressive given the slimmer profile. Samsung could increase the capacity, which it often does each year for some of its flagships, but it may also have the same battery. We also expect the same 25W wired charging speed, although given the decrease to 10W wireless charging on the Z Flip 7, we're unsure about what the Galaxy Z Flip 8 will end up with in that regard.</p><p>Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-asks-users-sacrifice-thin-phonesbuilt-in-qi2-magnets-survey">questioning consumers</a> about whether or not they want Qi2 magnets on their phones, which could suggest the company is looking into implementing this on its future phones. However, it's unclear if this will work on the Galaxy Z Flip 8.

However, we can still wish for what we want to see based on the current (and even past) Galaxy Z Flip, with the hopes that Samsung will listen and deliver. Here are some of the features we hope to see:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 was already a bit of a downgrade on the charging front, which is unfortunate to see on a $1,099 phone. The 25W charging speed is simply okay, but with phones like the Razr reaching as much as 68W, it's clear Samsung is purposely holding it back.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 8, we hope Samsung will finally give us flagship charging speeds, at least as much as 45W wired and 15W or more for wireless charging. This way, it will at least match some of the company's midrange phones and keep up with the steadily increasing battery capacity.</p><p>Qi2 support will also be nice, especially if built-in magnets are involved.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI button</strong></p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 includes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key</a>, which is meant to be a handy way to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> at the press of a button (and freeing the power button).

While both smartwatches have the same goal of trying to help you improve your running, they try to do so at different price points. The Forerunner 970, retailing for $750, brings the Forerunner closer in capabilities to Garmin's highest-end smartwatches. Meanwhile, the Forerunner 570 attacks the midrange market.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970 are both somewhat flawed devices. The Forerunner 570 lacks a few features we've come to take for granted at the $550 price point, like ECG support.

They come with a somewhat loud design, but this is typically appreciated by runners. Each is offered in unique colorways that can emphasize a sporty look, or you can opt for black to try to remain subtle.</p><p>Still, the Forerunner 970's polymer case doesn't look the most premium, and that's to preserve a lightweight build. It does have a titanium bezel and metal buttons for durability, though. There's also a colored Forerunner metal accent piece on the side to emphasize the runner-first ethos of this watch.

That being said, they're both cut from the same cloth, so there are a ton of design similarities here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin upgraded the display on the Forerunner 970, doubling its peak brightness. The smartwatch features a 1.4-inch AMOLED touchscreen with a 454x454 resolution. The move to AMOLED adds clarity and color while preserving brightness, and it doesn't appear to come at the cost of battery life.</p><p>By comparison, the Forerunner 570 ships with either a 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch screen, depending on what size you get. It's also an AMOLED panel, but this watch doesn't last as long as the Forerunner 970. Both watches will be plenty bright enough for outdoor workouts.</p><h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-vs-forerunner-570-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Forerunner 970 vs. Forerunner 570: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mapping-route" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing a course route on a detailed city map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are slight differences between the Forerunner 970 and 570 in terms of hardware.  Both watches use the same Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor, which is the latest and most accurate version. However, the 970 takes that one step further, adding ECG support and a skin temperature sensor. The Forerunner 970 and 570 both have a blood-oxygen sensor, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, and gyroscope.</p><p>The pricier 970 comes with quadruple the available storage space, with 32GB onboard. Meanwhile, you only get 8GB on the 570 for music and workout files. Additionally, the 970 has a few more GPS bands, and both support multi-band GPS.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 970 </p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 570</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>47 x 47 x 12.9mm, 22mm QuickFit band</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 42.4 x 42.4 x 12.9mm</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47 x 47 x 12.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>56 g</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>:<strong> </strong>42g</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 50g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium bezel, polymer case, silicone strap</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum bezel, silicone strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, sapphire glass</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5 ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.4" (454x454) AMOLED touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 1.2" (390 x 390)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 1.4" (454 x 454)</p><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>15 days, 23 hours (SatIQ GPS), 14 hours (multi-band GPS w/ music)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 10 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-only GNSS mode)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 11 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-Only GNSS mode)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, ECG, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HR, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Flashlight</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic & speaker</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of battery life, the Forerunner 970 will get you further.

They just aren't entirely equal. There are a few features exclusive to the Forerunner 970, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">Running Tolerance</a>. This will calculate a biomechanical "impact load" for each mile you run, adjusting for things like elevation and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). It's aimed to help you avoid overexertion and overuse injuries.</p><p>There are other perks, like <strong>running economy</strong> and <strong>step speed</strong>, available if you happen to have an HRM-600 chest strap to add data points.

It does lack electrocardiogram (ECG) support, which has become commonplace on smartwatches and offline maps. Still, I'd bet that most runners don't use either of those features very often — I know I don't. It's an excellent, slim, and sporty watch for running that's versatile and available in multiple sizes.</p><p>On the other hand, the Forerunner 970 is for the runner who's envious of multisport watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and wants that experience on a Forerunner model. At $750, the 970 is expensive, but it's actually much cheaper than those top-tier models like the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Enduro 3</a>.

Pre-orders for the device are rumored to start that same day, with full availability beginning Aug. 28.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is tipped to start with 256GB of storage, with upgrades to 512GB or 1TB available. Since the phone might not be available in the smaller 128GB base capacity, it will reportedly start at $1,199, an increase of $100 compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's rumored to be sold in Sterling Gray, Light Porcelain, Midnight, and Smoky Green colorways.</p><p>Even with a rumored price hike, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will cost less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> at full price. The phone was announced on Jan. 22, 2025, and was officially released Feb. 7. Samsung sells the Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,299, and it starts with 256GB of storage, with upgrades up to 1TB available.

By this point, we've not only seen alleged renderings for the device but also real-life shots. If these turn out to be true, we're looking at a design language that's quite similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. There's a pill-shaped camera bar, a matte back, polished side rails, and rounded corners.</p><p>It's possible that the dimensions are tweaked slightly, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">early case samples support that prediction</a>. However, we still expect the Pixel 10 Pro XL to keep a similar form factor to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which measured 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm and weighed 221 grams. After all, both phones have a 6.9-inch screen and the same hardware, according to rumors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It'll likely be a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED panel capable of 120Hz refresh rates and at least 3000 nits of peak brightness. The resolution is said to be 2992 x 1344 pixels, which is the same as last year. Covering the display will be Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it'll also serve as the rear glass.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has a similar footprint, with dimensions measuring 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm. In fact, it'll likely be both thinner and lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That's despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra offering a bigger, 6.9-inch screen and space for an internally stored S Pen stylus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-16x9" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Home Screen - 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9XYxfiXSVoD97gT4q6rYZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is a 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED with support for 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and a resolution of 3120 x 1440 pixels.

Samsung opted for a titanium construction on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which helps with strength and weight.</p><p>Both the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Galaxy S25 Ultra are expected to sport an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-01" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Um3rLTAzHFeM7e73XBQocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is set to upgrade the internals of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, per reports, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which is no surprise. The bigger deal is that the Tensor G5 chip is said to be fabricated by TSMC, rather than Samsung Foundry, and will use the advanced 3nm process. As part of the switch, Google is said to be moving to more custom internal components, perhaps improving Pixel's optimizations and efficiency gains.</p><p>With a Google-designed chip, more custom components, and TSMC fabrication, the Tensor G5 could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL become the most efficient and smooth Android phone yet. The phone is expected to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra will still be the performance champion, despite all of Google's expected improvements. It is equipped with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the fastest available for Android phones. It's particularly excellent for AI tasks, and it will be interesting to see how the Tensor G5 compares.</p><p>Notably, the Galaxy S25 Ultra ships with 12GB of RAM, whereas the Pixel 10 Pro XL could launch with 16GB by default.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 3000 nits (peak)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP (wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.7 wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP Wide, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Ultrawide, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 5x periscope telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x Telephoto, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x Telephoto, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td><td  ><p>HDR Portraits, Selfie AI ISP, Nightography, High-res Macro, High-res Zoom, Log Video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>39W wired, 23W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse-wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and rear glass)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Armor (front glass), Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (rear glass), Titanium</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>221 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 w/ Android 15 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the camera department, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely win, at least on paper. It has four rear camera sensors, and the system is highlighted by a 200MP wide camera. On top of that, you get a 50MP ultrawide, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. Put simply, this may be the most versatile system available in the U.S. market, fit for any situation.</p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to keep things exactly the same as its predecessor. That would mean three rear cameras, starting with a 50MP, f/1.7 main camera. The secondary cameras would be a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP periscope telephoto lens, with the latter being capable of 5x optical zoom.</p><p>There's more than meets the eye here, as hardware is only part of the story. If you prefer Samsung or Google's computational photography and color science profiles, that may be reason enough to choose one phone over another.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-to-wait-or-to-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: To wait or to buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are sure to be competitors immediately after the former's release. With the Galaxy S25 Ultra getting older, it'll likely see discounts that will help it match or beat the $1,199 price point of the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Samsung's use of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset will ensure the Galaxy S25 Ultra has an edge, even over the Tensor G5 processor in the newest Pixel.</p><p>There will be clear reasons to pick the Galaxy S25 Ultra over the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Aside from performance, the Galaxy has a larger display and S Pen support. It also brings along five total cameras and a combination of Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>. All of these could be deciding factors for people in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great Android phone</a>.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will have plenty of reasons to exist. It's slightly more compact, runs Pixel UI over One UI, and has Google's efficiency and optimization. It'll just be hard for Google's highest-end flagship to beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra on paper.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3bb2d9ca-466d-4901-899b-e1c624b1fb74">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZEu2Ducm7W2oGBJ8EuUfC.jpg' alt="The leaked render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A promising upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL should be an enticing Android phone due to the Tensor G5 platform shift and other improvements.

It's the long-awaited successor to the Phone 2, a phone that debuted in 2023 at a more affordable price point. Now, the question is simple: did Nothing do enough to make the Phone 3 a great value at $800?</p><p>On paper, it seems like the answer is a firm "no." The Nothing Phone 3 lacks a flagship processor and key specs, like LTPO support. Still, the Phone 3 is the evolution of the Phone 2, so should Nothing fans upgrade? Let's see how the new Nothing Phone 3 stacks up against the Phone 2 and find out.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-pricing-and-availability-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLXeGu6zh4ov8NHNnNuAUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a> became widely available worldwide on July 15, 2025. The phone costs $799 for the 12GB/256GB version, and $899 for the 16GB/512GB model. It's also available in Europe, the U.K., and India. You can get it in white or black colorways, and both get the customizable and interactive dot matrix display.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> launched in 2023 and started at $599 USD / $929 CAD for the 8GB/128GB configuration. The smartphone could be equipped with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for a higher cost. Now, two years later, it's hard to find new Phone 2 models at reasonable prices. It's no longer sold through the Nothing store, so you'll have to look at third parties and used markets.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing phones have never conformed to conventional design standards, but the Phone 3 diverts from the brand's own storied designs. Every Nothing phone to date, up until the Phone 3, has had a Glyph interface — a system of light strips that can be used for everything from notification and call alerts to serving as a makeshift flashlight.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2 features the Glyph interface, but the Nothing Phone 3 leaves that design staple behind in favor of a dot matrix grid. It's a tiny display that's more versatile than the Glyph interface, showing things like battery life and fun elements like Glyph Toys.</p><p>Officially, Nothing calls this the Glyph Matrix. If you've seen the rear display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, you already have an idea of what to expect from the Phone 3's Glyph Matrix.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-05.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone (2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZW9nisNrTB4mXhX24fMLgL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Phone 3 and Phone 2 are quite similar in terms of form factor. The newer model is actually a bit smaller, sporting a 6.67-inch screen instead of the 6.7-inch panel found on its predecessor. Both use OLED displays with 1,600 nits of peak brightness and can hit 120Hz refresh rates. Unfortunately, neither phone is using advanced display technology like LTPO variable refresh rates or high brightness modes.</p><p>As such, the Nothing Phone 3 is more compact overall but is thicker, measuring 160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm. Meanwhile, the Phone 2 is thinner and lighter, measuring 162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm and weighing in at 201.2 grams. At 218 grams, the Nothing Phone 3 will feel noticeably heavier than the Phone 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing also made sure the Phone 3 stood out in a crowd with its unique rear camera arrangement. There are three lenses on the back, but they're all positioned individually across the top-left corner of the device. By comparison, the Phone 2 has two rear lenses neatly organized vertically, closely resembling an iPhone camera layout.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 received a much-needed durability upgrade, as it now supports IP68 dust and water resistance. With only an IP54 certification, the dust and water-resistance capabilities of the older Phone 2 lagged behind the competition.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-phone-2-hardware-and-specs-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Phone 2: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yv9zGEWQ8zj4AB8nhsXbPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing's positioning of the Phone 3 as a true flagship starts to fall apart when moving to the device's internals.

Without it, the Nothing Phone 3's peak performance is limited.</p><p>With that being said, this chipset will make the Phone 3 feel much faster than the Phone 2 it replaces. The Nothing Phone 2 is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 mobile platform, and it's an older processor that isn't positioned well for the AI era. Additionally, you could make the argument that like the Nothing Phone 3, Google Pixel phones and their Tensor processors will lose to Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered flagships in raw performance.</p><p>Still, when you can get phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> for only a few bucks more, it makes paying $800 for the Nothing Phone 3 a tough sell.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 3</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.67-inch 120Hz OLED, Gorilla Glass 7i, 1,600 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch 120Hz OLED (LTPO), 2142 x 1080 (394 PPI), 1,600 nits peak brightness, Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 2 based on Android 13 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, Adreno 825, 4nm node</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB or 12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Sony IMX890, ƒ/1.88, 1.0μm, 1/1.56-inch sensor size, OIS and EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP  f/2.7 ISOCELL JN5, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, Samsung JN1 sensor, ƒ/2.2, 0.64μm, 1/2.76-inch sensor size, 114-degree FoV, EIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ISOCELL JN1, 4K60 video</p></td><td  ><p>32MP, ƒ/2.45, 1/2.7-inch sensor size</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP54 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, Dual-band GPS, AptX HD</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Wi-Fi 6, 5G Sub-6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>In-display fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, 3 microphones with noise suppression</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery (5,500mAh in India), 65W USB PD charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm; 218g</p></td><td  ><p>162.1mm x 76.4mm x 8.6mm; 201.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Black</p></td><td  ><p>White, Dark Gray</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Compared to Phone 2, the Nothing Phone 3 has the key advantage of having more base RAM and storage.

Or, whether you have a Google Pixel phone that can tightly integrate with the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>If you're choosing between the Garmin Vivoactive 6 and the Google Pixel Watch 3, let's break down how these smartwatches compare.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-13" alt="A workout on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3JU9S5KGiex4sWQQFp7nXC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> have relatively muted and simplistic designs, at least compared to other smartwatches. Google offers the Pixel Watch 3 in two different case sizes: 41mm and 45mm, allowing you to choose the one that best matches your wrist size. This does come at an extra cost — the 41mm watch starts at $349, and the 45mm watch starts at $399.</p><p>Still, it may serve you better than the Vivoactive 6, which tries to find a middle ground as a one-size-fits-all watch with a 42mm case size. It's cheaper, retailing for $299, and also thinner. At 10.9 mm thick, the Vivoactive 6 will have a slimmer profile on the wrist than the 12.3mm Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-weather-tile" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing the Weather tile, with an hourly forecast for the evening." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's Vivoactive 6 is made using a fiber-reinforced polymer case with an anodized aluminum bezel and a silicone strap.

The Vivoactive 6 sports a 1.2-inch AMOLED screen with a 390x390 resolution, and if you're used to bigger smartwatch displays, this might feel a bit cramped. Surprisingly, Google crammed a bigger display into a smaller case size, as the 41mm Pixel Watch 3 comes with a 1.27-inch AMOLED panel with a 408x408 resolution.</p><p>Of course, you can always step up to the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 if you need a bigger screen. The larger variant has a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a 456x456 resolution.</p><h2 id="garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-google-pixel-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Google Pixel Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-12" alt="A workout animation on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nX3bKtM98uLsNbfyJyjBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4109" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Garmin Vivoactive 6 provides a robust health and fitness experience of the features it <em>does</em> support, there are some gaps. For instance, the watch includes the last-gen Garmin Elevate v4 heart-rate monitor, an accelerometer, a pulse-oxygen sensor, a compass, and a gyroscope. This, paired with Garmin software, helps paint a pretty full picture of your health and fitness data at the $299 price point.</p><p>Still, there are things missing, like a barometric altimeter — this means you can't track elevation during runs or hikes. Other key hardware omissions include a microphone and speaker, so you won't be answering calls on your watch with the Vivoactive 6.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel Watch 3 has a more well-rounded sensor suite, adding an altimeter, barometer, electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA) sensor, and a skin temperature sensor. It also supports ECG readings, if you care about those. The tricky part about this comparison is that the Pixel Watch doesn't always make the most of this data because its software features are limited.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Vivoactive 6</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer (Case); Anodized aluminum (Bezel)</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen, 390 x 309</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass 3; 5ATM</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>20mm quick-release band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS, BeiDou; All-Systems mode (No dual band)</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v4 HRM; Pulse Ox (SpO2); accelerometer; ambient light sensor; compass; gyroscope</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Garmin Pay (NFC), Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic and speaker</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Smartwatch mode: 11 days</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/ 420mAh, 24 hours with AOD, 36 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Music storage</p></td><td  ><p>8GB; Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music, or own music files</p></td><td  ><p>32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42.2 x 42.2 x 10.9 mm</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight / with strap</p></td><td  ><p>23g / 36g</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 55g/63g; 45mm: 61g/69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$299.99</p></td><td  ><p>$349.99 (41mm), $399.99 (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Additionally, the Google Pixel Watch 3 does support LTE connectivity, but you have to pay extra for that model.

Both excel in their own key areas. Despite having fewer sensors, the Vivoactive 6 has a better health and fitness software suite.</p><p>It can track more than 80 different kinds of workouts, which is great if you train outside the box. Garmin's software will also suggest daily walks for you to keep you active and moving. There are workout videos viewable right on the watch and specialized features like workout tracking. This will detect your weightlifting reps and rests automatically during and between sets.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 uses Fitbit primarily for health and fitness software. It's not as great an experience as Garmin's robust suite, but it may do the job if you only track casual workouts. Crucially, the Pixel Watch 3 runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, which means you have a large suite of third-party apps and smartphone integration available.

GPS tracking is more consistent, and there are extra non-running features for those who prefer the gym to the track. If that sounds like you, the Vivoactive 6 will probably serve you better than the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>However, the Pixel Watch 3 has a similar advantage — it runs Wear OS. If you need tight integration with your Android phone, like the Fitbit UI, or rely on third-party smartwatch apps, the Pixel Watch 3 is your pick. It all depends on your individual needs. For health features, go with Garmin. For smart features, choose Pixel.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="75b5b5c4-3808-4a3c-b02b-217891e7919c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/secwvVBDhnoMFv8tL5mbJ6.jpg' alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Vivoactive 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All about fitness</strong></em></p><p>While the Vivoactive 6's health and fitness suite is relatively tame by Garmin standards, it's robust compared to Wear OS watches.

While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">Ear 1</a> had issues with tonality, Nothing resolved these with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, and subsequent products have been nothing short of incredible. So when the brand said it was venturing into headphones, I was obviously excited. I prefer over-ear headsets to earbuds, and the Headphone 1 is positioned as an alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> and Sony WH-1000XM6.</p><p>Obviously, design is a key tenet of all Nothing products, and the Headphone 1 looks like nothing else available today. As much as I like the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a>, I think the Headphone 1 is Nothing's best-looking product yet. The unique rectangular design with a stylized outer shell that evokes memories of cassettes is just plain cool, and the novelty doesn't really wear off even after using the Headphone 1 for a while.</p><p>The white model in particular looks gorgeous, and the distinctive design is backed by good build quality. The shell is made out of aluminum, and it's joined by a plastic headband. At 329g, it is on the lighter end of the scale, and I like the comfort quite a bit — I didn't have any issues wearing the Headphone 1 for hours on end.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtXA9S5zweEBqfxPJZbSVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The retro-futuristic design combined with a comfortable fit makes the Headphone 1 a better choice than the Sony WH-1000XM6, and I like the attention to detail.

The bundled case is pretty good as well, and it doesn't take up too much room. The Headphone 1 gets a 1,040mAh battery, and it lasted just under 30 hours in my testing. That's more than enough, and you get a fast charging mode that delivers two hours music playback with just a five-minute charge; a full charge takes over two hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHT6sEjrt8d4pNjhVvVdWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing did a good job dialing in the noise isolation as well, and I didn't have any problems in this area. My QuietComfort Ultra still has the edge, but the Headphone 1 does a good enough job tuning out ambient sounds. You can easily customize settings via Nothing X, and there's also an 8-band EQ that allows for granular customization of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2moWzQ9nbUGymTHjAmkjVZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the sound, the Headphone 1 is made in collaboration with British audio powerhouse KEF.

The Headphone 1 has a custom 40mm driver with sound tuned by KEF, and it sounds amazing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfDzv7ozBPiYUjKcTt92VZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's good low-end energy and vibrancy, and bass-focused tracks have a delightful rumble.

KEF's unique sound signature is evident in the tuning of these headphones, and if you want a neutral sound, you can easily tweak the EQ to your liking.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed using the Headphone 1 much more than I thought; if anything, I like the headphones more than the Phone 3. The design is sure to turn heads, it's comfortable to wear, sounds great, and is a better deal than its equivalent Sony and Bose rivals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5ac4b34e-edac-4c9d-97be-1dd875f0706e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:145.07%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWqC28UuSUoU6CKNKeXqn5.jpg' alt="Nothing Headphone 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Headphone 1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Headphone 1 is a standout product; it looks distinctive, has a fantastic sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It is an AI-powered app that effectively stores all your vital information. The company is now introducing additional features, making it even smarter.</p><p>Late last week, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/37461-essential-space-updates">rolled out an update</a> that incorporates Google Calendar. It allows users to sync their to-dos lists directly into Google Calendar.

Users who prefer to record meetings, interviews, or conversations will now be able to fix AI summaries with the edit feature. Further, these recorded moments are now shareable as well. They can be shared in notable formats like via an image, PDF, or Markdown, One tap, or fully packaged.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM" name="Essential-Space-editable-memory" alt="Essential Space editable memory" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABpMzfgF4sc94mTmZ2BnVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record" alt="Essential Space Flip to record" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux5ziiyNHFVGidG6DGJkVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM" name="Essential-space-flip-to-record-share" alt="Essential Space flip to record sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPxcZEM7jzg8pm6Cp82bVM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="who-gets-it-first-2">Who gets it first?</h2><p>As mentioned, the Essential Space feature is available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro</a>, and even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a> has a new color option, and comes with 64GB of internal storage; other than that, it is identical to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024.</p><p>With Samsung choosing to not make any changes this year, any potential upgrades are only likely to show up on the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-Funny-Faces-watch-face" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a white counter, showing the Funny Faces watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NdQkVLAHgipErUWueKZi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has a distinctive design with the Galaxy Watch Ultra that makes it stand out quite a bit from the regular Galaxy Watch, and that's set to continue in 2026. I don't see the brand making any considerable tweaks to the design next year, but I would like to see the rotating bezel make its way onto the device.</p><p>The bezel makes interacting with a smartwatch that much more convenient, and it's a clear point of differentiation with Samsung. Another limiting factor is that the Galaxy Watch Ultra doesn't use standard lugs, and that needs to change; as it stands, there's a limited selection of bands you can use with the smartwatch.</p><p>The 47mm sizing makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra the ideal size, and I don't want that to change in 2026. Samsung does a good job with the chassis itself with the titanium casing clearly built to last, and it's a given that the brand will continue using the same material next year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2026-features"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026: Features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra features the Exynos W1000 platform that's built on a 3nm node, and it delivers significant gains from previous years. I want slightly better efficiency with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 that allows the smartwatch to last at least three days between charges.</p><p>Outside of that, the only other feature I want to see is tighter AI integration. Samsung will ideally need to use a new platform based on the foundation of the W1000 but with a powerful NPU to deliver this, and it's likely we'll see just that in 2026.</p><p>On the feature side of things, Samsung really needs to make ECG available to other devices — having this limited to Samsung phones is a huge drawback. I routinely switch between phones, and not having all features available with a smartwatch is a deal-breaker.</p><p>Similarly, I'd like to see better activity tracking with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026; there are enough built-in workout modes, but the current iteration of the smartwatch just doesn't do as good a job as its Garmin rivals when it comes to accuracy.</p><p>Considering the lack of any meaningful upgrades with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, I'd suggest getting the 2024 model if you're interested in switching to a new smartwatch. It has the same feature-set, and it continues to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> around — and there are great deals to be had right now. If you're willing to wait, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2026 should deliver decent gains next year.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0f600266-e8d2-486d-a420-234922bf4b3b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqnudFCbUPtb4UpBK5ztT6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'> </span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra 2024 continues to be just as good as the 2025 model, and it's a much better value now that it's on sale. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung delivered plenty of upgrades with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>; the foldable has a thinner and lighter design than its predecessor, and it holds its own against its Chinese rivals in this regard. That's no small feat considering brands like Vivo and Honor have pushed the boundaries in this area in recent years.</p><p>That said, Samsung continues to lag behind when it comes to the battery and cameras, and it misses out on other extras that are standard on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>. I'm just getting started with my Z Fold 7, and this is what I want to see in next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming in at just 4.2mm when unfolded, the Z Fold 7 is one of the thinnest foldables around. That makes a clear difference when using the device next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Samsung did the right thing by increasing the cover panel to 6.5 inches. This was a major point of contention in the past, and it's thankfully not an issue on the Z Fold 7.</p><p>It's unlikely Samsung will alter the design next year — it has shown that it wants to retain a similar aesthetic year after year — but what I want to see is a slight tweak that makes the device easier to hold. The flat sides are a smidgen uncomfortable, and the addition of bevels like on the Magic V5 and Vivo X Fold 5 should make the Z Fold 8 that much easier to hold and use.</p><p>While Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, the Z Fold 8 is limited to IP48 ingress protection, with the Magic V5 and X Fold 5 featuring IP58 and IP59 dust and water resistance as standard. With Google set to deliver IP68 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Samsung needs to deliver better durability next year if it wants to maintain its position in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-battery"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Battery</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UERVtfPwoYACWPo9TKawo3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I like that the Z Fold 7 is considerably thinner, the foldable has the smallest battery of any device I used in 2025. The 4,400mAh battery is just pitiful when even smaller phones like the Vivo X200 FE have a 5,300mAh cell, and I don't really know what Samsung was thinking by putting such a small battery in its latest foldable.</p><p>Clearly, that needs to change in 2026. The Z Fold 8 needs to have at least a 5,000mAh battery, considering this year's Magic V5 has a 5,850mAh battery and the X Fold 5 comes with an even bigger 6,000mAh battery. Switching from the X Fold 5 to the Z Fold 7, there's a clear difference in battery longevity, and this is something Samsung has to rectify with the Z Fold 8.</p><p>On that note, 25W charging just isn't enough any longer on a device that's pushing $2,000. All other foldables I used this year at least have 66W charging, and Samsung is lagging behind by quite a big amount in this area. The biggest advantage of a foldable is the increased real estate made possible by the inner panel, but that's meaningless if the device doesn't even manage to last all day.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 8: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-29" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung did the right thing by upgrading the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a 200MP unit. This allows the foldable to hold its own against Honor and Vivo, and while it is undoubtedly a positive move, Samsung didn't lavish the same level of attention on the auxiliary cameras.</p><p>The 12MP wide-angle lens is decent enough, but the 10MP tele lens leaves much to be desired, and it just isn't as good as what you get on the X Fold 5 and Magic V5. Samsung clearly needs to address this shortcoming with the Galaxy Z Fold 8, because it's not just the main camera that differentiates a foldable, but the overall package.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7 just now starting to become available, we'll have to wait until July 2026 to see what the Z Fold 8 has in store. Thankfully, we should get plenty of details of Samsung's 2026 foldable before that time, and I'll update this post as and when new information becomes available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You fill out a quick survey with your age, height, weight, and gender, then log the furthest distance you've run — None, 5K, 10K, half marathon, or marathon — and how fast you finished.</p><p>You must then complete a 12-minute "running test," starting at a "comfortably hard pace" before building to "full speed," and are lastly timed on how quickly your heart rate recovers during cooldown. It's Samsung's equivalent to the lactate threshold test.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nh16o10JOR4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Based on your survey and test results, Samsung gives you a 1–10 rank; each level has a target distance and pace that you must hit to level up. Levels 1–3 focus on finishing a 5K, 4–5 on 10Ks, 6–7 on a half marathon, and 8–10 on a full marathon.</p><p>For each level, you're given a 3-to-5-week training plan, with tailored runs each week to build up your speed and endurance. Only after you've completed most of your workout plan can you take the "level test" and graduate to the next tier.</p><div ><table><caption>Samsung Running Coach levels</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Level</p></th><th  ><p>Goal</p></th><th  ><p>Test</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>1–3</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 5K under 35 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 1: </strong>0.93 miles under 10:22 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 2: </strong>1.86 miles under 20:45 (11:09/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 3: </strong>3.10 miles under 34:34 (11:09/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>4–5</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a 10K under 1:10</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 4: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:09:09 (11:08/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 5: </strong>6:21 miles under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>6–7</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a half marathon under 2:30</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 6: </strong>9.32 miles under 1:42:43 (11:01/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 7: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:24:08 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>8–10</p></td><td  ><p>Finish a marathon under 5:00</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Level 8: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:20:38 (10:44/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 9: </strong>13.1 miles under 2:17:07 (10:28/mile)</p><p><strong>Level 10: </strong>26.2 miles under 4:48:15 (11:00/mile)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Each workout plan is "designed to help users train safely for marathons" or shorter distances through "optimized intensity and injury-preventive routines." Samsung says an "experienced runner" should find a program that's right for them, even if Running Coach is "ideal for beginners."</p><p>While the lower levels focus on walking, jogging, and low-intensity runs to build endurance, the higher levels have a wide range of activities: Fartlek runs, repetitions, high-intensity intervals, buildup runs, long slow distance runs, and jogging, among others. That kind of complex variety is vital for increasing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Kro5Gg67rCeJ8yjD4BEVr3" name="Samsung-Running-Coach-workout-plan-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic" alt="A Galaxy phone showing a Level 7 Samsung Running Coach training plan, with Week 1 showing one workout completed with a 96/100 score and three upcoming workouts.

Samsung knows that "serious" runners already gravitate towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatche">fitness watches</a> with long battery life. So it's focusing on amateurs, with a gamified system that introduces them to a wide range of workout types, without overwhelming them.</p><p>Running Coach has you complete 3–4 activities a week, but on your own schedule instead of Samsung's. This gives running newbies the leeway to recover from tough runs or give themselves an off-day without worrying about failing the program. You don't need to finish every workout before taking a level test, just enough to improve.</p><h2 id="samsung-running-coach-doesn-t-know-how-to-rank-experienced-runners-2">Samsung Running Coach doesn't know how to rank 'experienced runners'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-level-data" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic worn on a wrist outside, the display showing where Level 7 ranks on a distance timeline and the words "Beginner's half marathon: Level 7" underneath." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCmciXRe4BbQSj5DTMJUvS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I took the Running Coach survey, I gave Samsung my last half-marathon pace (1hr:54m), then finished my Watch 8 running test at a 7:09/mile pace. It wasn't my best, as I had to run it on a rolling trail, and I ran too fast at the start, but I figured it would be enough to satisfy Samsung.</p><p>Instead, Samsung placed me in Level 7, the "beginner's half marathon tier," with a target of running a half in 2:24 — 30 minutes slower than I ran during a fairly mediocre (for me) race a month ago. Aside from stinging my ego, my workout training plan just isn't tailored to me.</p><p>My first recommended workout was a 5.5-mile "pace run" with a 3/5 difficulty score at 10:11 pace; I finished it at a 9:52 pace, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> on my other wrist graded it a "low-aerobic run," meaning not that hard. My next run of "high-intensity intervals" will max out at 9:07 pace for five 0.62-mile splits. Trust me, that's mid-intensity for me, at best.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-running-coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Running Coach workout, with a distance of 3.1 miles and a target pace of 9:07." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CGu26zRViJYT3Qwp5nZdtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand that this level-7 training plan isn't for me; it's intended for intermediate runners. However, Samsung needs to do a better job of ranking me or adapting to my average pace, as I can't manually level up. Instead, I would need to retake the 12-minute placement test or complete another 17 workouts at slow paces to qualify for level 8.</p><p>If Samsung let runners choose an HR zone instead of pace as the workout criteria, this would solve the issue and let runners target the intensity that's right for them.</p><p>For now, this Running Coach really is meant to, well, coach slow novice runners. It's a promising beta that <em>could</em> eventually help experienced runners. But so long as it focuses on building up mileage at a slow pace, those who want to get faster at their current race distance will be out of luck.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-has-some-fundamental-issues-for-runners-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has some fundamental issues for runners</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout-main-screen" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdSZ42pfWvjFAVcANTCmAh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Running-Coach-workout" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a wrist showing a Running Coach workout screen with current pace, distance, average pace, heart rate, and time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A7raUJXYZo5DkyXtH9BdCh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Most smartwatches have guided workouts that buzz your wrist if you fall out of the target pace or HR range. Samsung's Running Coach workouts follow this system, but not very well!</p><p>The photos above show the default workout screen, with your current pace, distance, average pace, and HR. The color changes if your HR average is too high or low, but it doesn't say anywhere what the target range <em>is</em>, or say if your current pace is outside the zone.</p><p>Worse, my "current pace" was erratic and incorrect for most of the run. The final tracked pace was 9:58/mile (Garmin measured 9:52), but the watch display usually showed me much slower than that (around 10:20–40), even as I got notifications saying I was on or above pace. Without my Garmin to ground me with actual pace data, I wouldn't have known how fast I was moving at any given moment.</p><p>The <em>most</em> annoying part was how the Watch 8 told me I was "on pace" over and over. I expect a notification when I go off pace and when I'm back on; that's it. Instead, every minute or two, I'd be told whether I was on pace, and I had to check every notification in case I wasn't. It distracted me from my rhythm and rarely conveyed useful info.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-5" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhRNeu5RNenA4azq2pM3QW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-1" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApCPDupunpPbP7Ca7xDzSW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-2" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXqFQ64DzsAt5fdKsEnqPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-3" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yQ7ursMmxxb7mTjRXCEPW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-GPS-test-4" alt="A Google Earth satellite map showing the GPS path of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (blue) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange) worn by the same runner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bobqBFDN3EXWWiNYbb9UJW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I wonder whether inconsistent GPS data led to the erratic pace data.

Maybe it's for a new album. Maybe it's for nostalgia. But rarely would you expect to enjoy a cover band better than the original.</p><p>That's how I feel about the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, a phone that looks identical to its predecessor, yet still somehow packs all the wonder and fun of the original without introducing anything new. Even stranger, it's the small cover display that I found enjoying the most, not the large, beautiful inner display that folds in half like liquid glass magic.</p><p>This isn't the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> I've reviewed for Android Central, by any means. I've spent ample time with Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip line since the second iteration, and I've used camera-focused alternatives from Chinese brands like Vivo. But none of them make a flip phone quite like Motorola, and so much of that is wrapped up in how the cover screen works and how it transforms the flip experience.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2025-specs-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 specs</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640x1080, HDR10+, LTPO 165Hz, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640 x 1080, HDR10+, 165Hz LTPO, 3000 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO, 2,400 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO 2400 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="the-cover-is-the-headliner-2">The cover is the headliner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-in-pocket" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025's cover screen hanging out of a pocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJLFMy2Mtb6yPUxpxWUfbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike book-style foldables — think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> — the cameras on the flip phones are basically attached to the cover display.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, Samsung still makes you jump through several hoops to get any app you want on the cover screen for a flawed experience. Motorola's implementation just works like a normal phone, including an app launcher, but it's the notification support that really makes a difference.</p><p>On a Galaxy Z Flip, when you receive a notification and tap it on the cover screen, the phone will often prompt you to unfold it to interact with that app or notification. On a Razr, the app just opens on the cover screen. That's it. Nothing complicated. No unnecessary extra steps or weird apps to install. It's as user-friendly as it gets, and it blows my mind that Samsung still hasn't fixed this problem with its Flips.</p><p>Because of this, I was able to fully enjoy the <em>tiny </em>size of the Razr Plus 2025 instead of getting annoyed that I had to open it constantly. It felt like a true pocket-friendly companion rather than something that was convenient when <em>it </em>wanted to be.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-01" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7nkzqH8scAMK2gEXz6QBi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-mocha-mousse-02" alt="The Glamorous back of the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wsjnadk3hhipceYTc4V7i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-flex-mode-camera-tented" alt="The Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025 tented on a stump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzg5XXeBEBXuv5QbjxGh8i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I prefer Motorola's design and build over Samsung's models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and 7 are overly flat phones, and I simply do not like flat phones. Having a curve to the edge of a device makes it nicer to hold, easier to open, and better looking overall, in my experience.</p><p>Not only that, but Motorola's use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">Pantone-certified colors and materials</a> is second to none.

In benchmarks, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is slightly faster than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> but slightly slower than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip <strong>5</strong></a>.</p><p>While that sounds concerning, real-world performance tells me that it doesn't matter. The only time I ever thought the phone felt slow was when I rebooted it after an update, and it was busy finalizing the update in the background. Most phones have a lag period after updating because of the app optimization process, so this isn't a cause for concern.</p><p>Having a "slower" processor ultimately means that the phone prioritizes battery life over performance, ensuring you won't run out of battery before the day is over. This was once a problem with flip phones, but Razrs solved that problem a while back. Plus, the 45W charging speed leaves Samsung's flip phones in the dust, with a full charge (0-100%) taking only 45 minutes in my testing.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL" name="IMG_20250701_192000634_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gSXwJoExFqrGWMRX7PT9iL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL" name="IMG_20250628_163501430_HDR_PORTRAIT" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hz6Db8FvnVBnwBSumQ88jL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2250" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL" name="IMG_20250626_074335664_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsT8p7soUhgGeicMgLJpyL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL" name="IMG_20250617_190131183_HDR" alt="Photo samples taken from the Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJbDHd4sa76CCsjLLrF5vL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>More often than not, the camera quality from this phone exceeded my expectations, which, to be frank, were low given Motorola's less-than-stellar reputation for camera quality. I should have expected good quality given the shots my wife has been able to pull off on her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/one-year-with-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> over the past year, but it's still nice to be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>I <em>love</em> taking portrait photos with this phone, especially since the cover display makes it so effortless. Taking group photos with this phone using portrait mode is nothing short of stunning, and everyone will regularly say "wow!" when they see the viewfinder on the cover screen. Seriously, it happens every time.</p><p>Motorola included a 2x telephoto camera on this year's model again, opting for moderately better zoom detail over the more useful ultrawide angle lens from the 2023 model. I would still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">prefer for Moto to revert to having a standard and an ultrawide lens</a> for the 2026 model, especially since the other two Razr 2025 models have this configuration.</p><h2 id="the-moto-ai-quotient-2">The Moto AI quotient</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-moto-ai" alt="Moto AI running on the Mocha Mousse Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tikBTKmmXsniXi77hjaF8i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the big highlights of this year is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, a suite of new tools designed to be "helpful," as all AI things are marketed to be. The reality is that most of these features sound cooler or more useful than they actually are. Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/how-use-moto-ai-playlist-studio">AI-generated playlists feature</a>, for example. It'll generate a playlist of songs based on your request, but it's limited to 10 songs in length and currently only works with Amazon Music.</p><p>Then there's the 'Catch Me Up' feature, designed to summarize your notifications when you've put your phone away for a while. I tried this several times when my phone accumulated dozens of notifications, but overall, it didn't seem particularly helpful.</p><p>The 'Remember This' feature sounded like something I would genuinely love to use. "Save screenshots, notes, and images to your Memory with AI-generated summaries and object recognition technology so that you can recall them later." The problem is that I had no idea where to find them after I saved them, and even after I figured it out, I stopped using the feature when I realized it took several steps to find what it saved.</p><p>There are many great ideas in here, and I think the suite could become <em>very</em> good with more development time. For now, though, it feels half-baked and more like a user study than a final product.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-2">Should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-green-with-motorola-plus-2025-mocha-02" alt="The folded backs of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in Green and Motorola Razr Plus 2025 in Mocha" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgE9fPA9nYMHdvcf6JbhTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're currently on a Razr Plus 2024, there's no reason to upgrade. Yes, Motorola has upgraded the hinge with titanium and improved dust resistance, but almost everything else about the phone remains the same.</p><p>The cameras are still excellent and often surprise me with their quality, particularly when using portrait mode. The phone features the same 4-year update guarantee as its predecessor. And while I commend Motorola for some of the ideas in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, I found nothing in the suite that I used daily.</p><p>Motorola sells the Razr Plus 2025 for $100 less than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. While Samsung offers seven years of software updates for its phone, I don't believe for a minute that any flip phone will last seven years without something breaking. I love foldables and can vouch for their durability, but I've seen numerous folding tests, and none of them suggest that a flip phone will last longer than five years at most.</p><p>Because of that, I recommend grabbing the Razr Plus 2025 over the Z Flip 7.

While the Google Pixel Watch 3 is a fan favorite among Android users, it still pales in comparison to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> from Samsung and OnePlus in key areas.</p><p>That's why we're looking forward to the upcoming Google Pixel Watch 4, which aims to address some of these pain points, potentially bringing the smartwatch into true flagship territory. The Pixel Watch 4 hasn't been officially revealed yet, but early rumors and leaks give us an idea of what the next Google Watch might bring. Here's a speculative breakdown of how the Pixel Watch 4 might improve upon the Pixel Watch 3.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> is expected to launch alongside the Pixel 10 series, which will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">debut at an August 20 event</a>. For reference, the Pixel Watch 3 was announced on August 13, 2024, and became available as of September 10, 2024.</p><p>As for pricing, no current rumors or leaks point to a price change for the Pixel Watch 4. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260">a recent leak</a> suggests that the price will remain the same in Europe, which is good news. That would mean you'll pay $349 for a 41mm watch and $399 for a 45mm watch, with optional LTE versions costing another $100 on top of that. However, these prices are unconfirmed and could certainly rise due to inflation and other supply chain factors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is currently available in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with prices starting at $349 and $399, respectively. Each size has three colorways: Matte Black and Polished Silver for both models, Champagne Gold as the 41mm exclusive, and Matte Hazel as the 45mm exclusive. The upgrade to cellular connectivity costs an extra $100.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">Leaked Google Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> might give us an early preview of Google's upcoming smartwatch. Put simply, the Pixel Watch 4 appears to have a questionable design, of these renders turn out to be accurate. They depict the Pixel Watch 4 as being about 2mm thicker than its predecessor, and without rear charging pins visible.</p><p>These design changes could be divisive among Pixel Watch fans. A positive of this change is that the Pixel Watch 4 could switch back to a wireless charging puck for power, rather than the contacts and pins on the Pixel Watch 3. On the flip side, this would mean that the Pixel Watch has changed charging methods three times in four generations, which isn't ideal for continuity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same "waterdrop" design language as its predecessors. This time, the bezels might be even slimmer, helping make the newer model feel more modern. If the case size remains roughly the same, we could see the Pixel Watch 4 displays slightly grow compared to the 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays on the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 measures 12.3mm thick, so if these rumors are true, the newer model could be close to 15mm thick.
