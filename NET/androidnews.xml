This new division of Reality Labs, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-gets-top-level-firepower-to-combat-android-xr">just one month ago</a>, was created to cleanly split Reality Labs into more tangible business goals, and it was clearly put in place ahead of the big moves we saw in the past two weeks.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/meta-s-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-for-metaverse-efforts" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report, Meta may be making 30% cuts to the division starting in January. That was enough for plenty of outlets to circle the wagons and cry that "VR is dead" once again, a mantra that far too many tech-forward publications love to scream year in and out. But the reality doesn't fit that narrative at all. In fact, reality is exactly the opposite of what these places purport.</p><p>Meta <em>just</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">hired two top-tier designers from Apple</a> right before this news broke, and that news came just days after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025">fresh leaks pointed toward</a> a gaming-focused, high-end Meta Quest 4 in the works. Unironically, this is all happening as CTO Andrew Bosworth's promise that 2025 will be “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure" is about to expire, signaling that the company's focus on Horizon Worlds as the go-to "metaverse" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-its-time-to-kill-horizon-worlds-before-it-kills-the-meta-quest">was the problem all along</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Since then, this division has been responsible for developing VR headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses" target="_blank">smart glasses</a>, Horizon Worlds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG gesture bands</a>, the Horizon operating system, next-generation realistic avatars, and more.</p><p>Meta spends billions on Reality Labs technology investments each quarter, with spending growing from about $2 billion in Q4 2020 to a whopping $6.05 billion in Q4 2024. Since 2022, over 50% of Reality Labs' budget has been spent developing true AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, though the closest Meta has come to releasing a consumer product is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a>.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-cuts-employees-in-its-biggest-lay-off">the end of 2022</a>, Meta has been cutting spending in most divisions by around 10% per year to get costs under control. Because of Reality Labs' unbridled spending growth, Zuckerberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reality-labs-spending-cuts-by-2026/">reportedly requested</a> a 20% spending <em>cut </em>by the end of 2025. That apparently never happened.</p><p>Now, the division needs to cut spending by 30% to match the 10% annual cut plus the 20% 2025 cut that didn't happen. That's not a deep cut; that's an alignment with every other division within Meta.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC" name="meta-quest-2-pro-3-straight.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta isn't abandoning VR at all, far from it. But I do believe the company is making important shifts away from failed projects like Horizon Worlds and toward the development of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-reportedly-pushes-the-release-of-new-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027" target="_blank">a new pair of mixed-reality</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-reportedly-pushes-the-release-of-new-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027"> glasses</a>. The December 4 report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-metaverse-reality-labs-ai-2025-12">Business Insider</a> aligns with this view, and new leaks about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025" target="_blank">gaming-focused, ultralight Meta Quest 4</a> further complete the picture of what's happening at Meta.</p><p>Now, does that mean Horizon Worlds is going away tomorrow? Absolutely not. Meta has significantly redesigned the operating system that powers the Meta Quest (called Horizon OS) to revolve around using Horizon Worlds as a central social platform. Some elements of this transition have proven to be a boon to the Quest's OS, such as easier ways to connect and chat with friends and less friction for new users.</p><p>Instead, I think Meta will now begin to focus more on game developers again as it attempts to rekindle relationships it tanked when it went all-in on Horizon Worlds integration. VR games <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">have been obscenely difficult to find</a> on the official Meta Quest store because Horizon Worlds content has been front and center for the past 15 months or so, causing real problems for developers and Meta Quest game sales.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AVJKoSUjRxT8VdcTsmYK4S" name="meta-quest-VR-prototype-holocake-2-render.jpg" alt="Meta Holocake 2 VR prototype from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVJKoSUjRxT8VdcTsmYK4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With all of that now in focus, it paints a much clearer picture of what Reality Labs is doing and what Meta's future products are going to look like. For now, Meta Quest headsets, along with smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, are going to continue pulling in around a billion in revenue each quarter, with Meta hoping for more growth in these segments as it starts to significantly trim spending.</p><p>That's not Meta giving up on VR or "the Metaverse," as many like to purport.

U.S. customers can also find it at Verizon, Total Wireless, Straight Talk, Simple Mobile, Tracfone, Walmart Family, and Visible starting December 11, 2025.</p><p>Motorola is selling the phone for an impressively low $199, matching last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> price while feeling snappier in the process. While it retains the same MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC and 4GB of RAM, the phone sings along with Motorola's version of Android 16, which is preinstalled when you power it on for the first time. Even though it's a budget price, Motorola is still promising two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates, so you can use it safely for years to come.</p><p>While last year's phone marked a huge improvement in the historically lackluster Moto G line, this year's takes that up another notch with notably better everyday performance and a better camera experience. That 50MP rear camera loads quickly and takes surprisingly decent pictures. Plus, the new Pantone-certified vegan leather colors feature unique textures and colors, especially the Cattleya Orchid pink phone I have for review.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

While the Mate XT is so much more than a technical showcase, Huawei still makes regular book-style foldables, and its latest model — the Mate X7 — brings a bigger battery and better cameras.</p><p>Huawei unveiled the Mate X7 in China on November 25, and introduced the foldable globally at a launch event in Dubai on December 11. The foldable will go on sale in select regions in Southeast Asia in the coming weeks, where it will cost the equivalent of €2,099 ($2,459).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FG5FKWp9kmNx5uMyEmQjjc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FG5FKWp9kmNx5uMyEmQjjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've always liked Huawei's design aesthetic, and the Mate X7 looks similar to its predecessor.

The foldable has a great in-hand feel, and at 235g, it isn't heavy in the least; Huawei somehow managed to bring down the weight by 4g while adding a bigger battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J8pJyxEPnyTNrKvkvySbkc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8pJyxEPnyTNrKvkvySbkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the red variant of the Mate X7, and it has a vegan leather back that's terrific to hold and use.

I like the in-hand feel thanks to the rounded edges and beveled sides, and the weight distribution is ideal.</p><p>The Mate X7 also gets IP58 and IP59 ingress protection, making it that much more durable — only Google delivers better protection on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Coming in at 4.5mm unfolded and 9.5mm folded, the Mate X7 isn't quite the thinnest foldable around, but honestly, it feels just as great to use as the Z Fold 7 or X Fold 5.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KwETKf8j8TNp5kJvt49ahc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwETKf8j8TNp5kJvt49ahc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where the X7 differentiates itself is the panel; both the 6.49-inch cover screen and the inner 8-inch OLED panels have better brightness than previous years, and it makes a genuine difference in outdoor use. Color rendition is better as well, and there's increased vibrancy. You get 120Hz refresh on either screen, and they both include 1,440Hz PWM as standard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9ybTNWwQNa9zWqFt4tGeic" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ybTNWwQNa9zWqFt4tGeic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The hinge itself has a smooth articulation and stays unfolded at various angles, and this hasn't proved to be an issue at all. Huawei has been making foldables for well over half a decade now, and continual tweaks to the hinge over the years has resulted in a lighter and better design. There is a marginal crease along the inner panel, but it isn't as evident as previous years, and with just a day of use, I don't notice it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you will notice is the cameras. Huawei always did a great job in this area, and the Mate X7 takes things to another level. The foldable gets a new 50MP main camera and 50MP 3.5x tele lens, with both modules featuring OIS. The 40MP wide-angle lens is the same as last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

I didn't see any issues in the day I used the Mate X7, and to Huawei's credit, it did a great job optimizing the foldable to the platform. But there's no denying the fact that it isn't as powerful as the Z Fold 7 or X Fold 5; I'll test how it holds up in gaming and other intensive tasks in the review.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="seZeGhKTULv4g8g2qHoShc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/seZeGhKTULv4g8g2qHoShc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tXhusVBYDxPNEaUz2FqFhc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tXhusVBYDxPNEaUz2FqFhc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ovqVDbYV6moQqrYSxYHhc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ovqVDbYV6moQqrYSxYHhc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Where it does a better job is the battery; even with heavy use that involved taking hundreds of photos and a few dozen videos, the Mate X7 managed to last the entirety of the day.

It has a clean UI with plenty of usable features, and you don't see any AI-assisted utilities on the device — which in itself feels refreshing. The software build I'm using isn't final, and while Huawei's devices don't include the Play Store, the brand lets you pre-install MicroG and GBox while setting up the Mate X7, and that makes it easier than ever to then sideload the Play Store and install all the Google services you use.</p><p>I'm just getting started with the Mate X7, and will have more to share on the phone over the coming weeks. There's clearly a lot to like with the foldable, and Huawei isn't letting trade limitations come in the way of delivering a fabulous overall device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Anyone in the U.S. can sign up for early access and get an invitation within a day starting Wednesday, Dec. 10.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Expanding-early-access-to-the-Gemini-for-Home-voice-experience/ba-p/771970" target="_blank">Google Nest community post</a>, Google says it is "going to start sending out invitations more rapidly." Additionally, any Google Home user with a U.S. address can sign up for the Gemini for Home early access program and get invited within 24 hours. Users can sign up for early access by opening the <strong>Google Home app</strong>, tapping their <strong>Google Account profile picture</strong>, pressing <strong>Home settings</strong>, and tapping <strong>Early Access</strong>.</p><p>In the past, Google tested new features through the Public Preview program for the Google Home app. This time, the Gemini for Home rollout has its own early access program, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/this-gemini-for-home-hack-lets-you-hear-the-new-assistant-early-with-a-catch">it has been very limited</a>. That is, until now. If you've been eager to get Gemini on your Google Home and Nest products, now is your chance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2i6tu6nKuChmFRbMtTsqPg" name="Google-Home-app-redesign" alt="The Google Home app for Android updated as of October 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2i6tu6nKuChmFRbMtTsqPg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini is available on every Google Home or Nest smart speaker and display released since 2016. The full experience, including Gemini Live support, is coming to the Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen), Nest Audio, Nest Mini (2nd-gen), and Nest Hub Max. The basic Gemini experience without Live is available on Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub (1st-gen), Home Max, Home Mini (1st-gen), Google Home, and third-party speakers.</p><p>Notably, this is the first time Google has confirmed Gemini will replace Assistant even on third-party hardware.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The next innovation in the phone industry is tri-folding devices, and Samsung is unveiling its efforts in this category with the Galaxy Z TriFold, which is slated to hit the U.S. in Q1 2026. While Samsung still doesn't have review units to give out to the media, it is selling the tri-fold in South Korea and the UAE. Incidentally, I'm in the UAE this week, and I was able to go hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold at the Dubai Mall, where Samsung is showcasing the foldable and taking pre-registrations ahead of the sale later this month.</p><p>As someone who used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> for the better part of the year, I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, and while I used it in a demo setting, the device is nothing short of incredible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold feels like an oversized model of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and that's a good thing; it has the same svelte design, and while it is thicker when folded because of the increased real estate, it is just as thin at 4.2mm when you unfold it to the full 10 inches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CZBYeHz5XDZ9eGBjSwxuGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZBYeHz5XDZ9eGBjSwxuGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, the Galaxy Z TriFold doesn't feel flimsy in the least; the hinges are just as smooth to articulate, and it feels great to hold in-hand when unfolded — it's basically a tablet that you can take anywhere. There's no visible crease either, and that makes a genuine difference.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HsqTCvrxkFaZ4QAipEebHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsqTCvrxkFaZ4QAipEebHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold may not have the biggest panel — the Mate XT goes up to 10.2-inch — but Samsung did an arguably better job with the inner and cover panels. Both panels go up to 120Hz (instead of 90Hz on the Mate XT), and they get brighter. Although it isn't using the latest Qualcomm silicon, the Snapdragon 8 Elite has plenty of power, and this isn't going to be a limiting factor in the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qov5DgfnEt4So3yJYemZHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qov5DgfnEt4So3yJYemZHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of differentiation is that the Galaxy Z TriFold gets a similar 200MP module as the Z Fold 7, so it should take decent photos — not that I was able to test it in the limited time I used the tri-folding device. The Kevlar texture on the rear feels great, and is different to what you get on other Galaxy Z devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="njnhBJECn9NxnnRAELRxGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njnhBJECn9NxnnRAELRxGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung went with an interesting design choice where the cover screen is sandwiched between the two sections that fold in, so when you're holding the device unfolded, your fingers inevitably come into contact with the cover panel, and it gets coated in smudges without any effort (as you can see in the photo above).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CC2bwUqpqPKmJbznwSyGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CC2bwUqpqPKmJbznwSyGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what's even more egregious is that the Galaxy Z TriFold isn't as versatile as the Mate XT. You can use it in just two configurations: the tablet-sized 10-inch inner panel, and the 6.5-inch cover panel. There's no way to use it as a traditional book-style foldable — unlike the Mate XT. This is annoying to say the least, as I use my Mate XT regularly with one section closed, and the 7.9-inch size comes in handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2hV9GjZypdL7Kr3CL4yGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Samsung, you don't have that choice. The touch layer shuts down when you close one of the folding panels, and there's even a correct way to close the foldable. You'll need to fold the left panel, and then the right. If you mistakenly close the right panel, you immediately get an alert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYGSigR9byuags95qRrUEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYGSigR9byuags95qRrUEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why is this, you ask? It's because the Galaxy Z TriFold's outer sections close inward, and the rear of the right panel houses the camera island. The U-styled design of the outer panel is fundamentally different to Huawei's Z-style design, and while it means the outer panel isn't at risk of taking damage, it is limited to one configuration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Out of the two tri-folding devices, I prefer Huawei's design better. I like the versatility of having three devices in one, and I don't like the positioning of the cover panel on the Z TriFold — it comes in the way too much when using the inner panel. That said, there's no arguing that the Z TriFold has better durability; it even gets IP48 ingress protection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung also does a great job with software, and the little I used of the Z TriFold was enough to see that it's similar to the Z Fold 7 in this regard. While I can only talk about battery life once I get my hands on a review unit, it's good to see Samsung going with a 5,600mAh unit on the device — its biggest battery on a Samsung phone yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2KiAryXnzDMUtCsz9EWQEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2KiAryXnzDMUtCsz9EWQEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Foldables are close to an inflection point; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> are just 4.2mm thick, and there really isn't much more than can be done with the design before limitations with the physical thickness of the USB-C port become a factor.</p><p>It's no wonder, then, that brands are now turning to new form factors. Huawei proved it can deliver a tri-folding device in the Mate XT, and while I thought it would be akin to the early wave of book-style foldables that debuted seven years ago, it was astonishingly easy to use — and durable. It held up to close to a year of use without any problems whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mNX9nRSfbGsqp3mqHtPcHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNX9nRSfbGsqp3mqHtPcHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Galaxy Z TriFold is a bold new vision for Samsung, and it's evident that the brand is testing the waters with the device. Samsung only plans to have 500 units of the tri-folding device on sale in the UAE, and it's likely that it will be the case in other countries where it will go on sale in 2026. Considering the foldable costs well over $3,000, it's understandable that Samsung isn't manufacturing it in bulk, but even then, it's good to see a legitimate rival to the Huawei Mate XT.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims that the phone's specifications (at least, what was listed) have been "certified" recently for the Verizon Network ahead of its launch. With that, the Pixel 10a is allegedly preparing to support 5G network connectivity, as well as a ~6.3-inch FHD Plus display.</p><p>The supposed listing then hits a few more "key" areas, like its camera, which could feature a 48MP wide-angle main lens.</p><p>This could be joined by a 13MP ultra-wide camera to round out its dual-array, leaving the display to house a 13MP selfie lens. For its battery, the tipster alleges a 5,100mAh capacity. The leaks end by claiming the Pixel 10a's RAM/storage might truly walk that affordable line with an 8/128GB configuration.</p><p>Aside from the alleged certification, no launch details were speculated; however, there's one important note with these specifications: we've seen them before.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Look what just got certified for use on Verizon's network. pic.twitter.com/OS5mTa9Zg5<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1998673588740563151">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The tipster's leak has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/caschy/status/1998677122689143061">spurred some discussions on X</a> with users, as some have noticed how similar they are to the Pixel 9a. This is true, as the Pixel 9a also featured a 6.3-inch display with a 48MP main camera lens, a 5,100mAh battery, and an 8/128GB configuration. It's probably not <em>too </em>strange, considering the true changes will likely come via its software—and its chip of choice. While users on X speculate that Google could pack the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 10a once again.</p><p>The device's specs aren't the only thing looking same-same, as earlier rumors suggest the Pixel 10a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-surfaces-in-a-new-leak-with-a-nearly-identical-to-pixel-9a">could even keep the design going</a>. A rendering leak from earlier this year showed off the new A-series Pixel with the same design as the Pixel 9a. That is with a dual camera array that's flush to its back panel and slightly thinner bezels.</p><p>The phone's chip has continued <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/looks-like-the-google-pixel-10a-might-be-a-total-snooze-fest">to be an object of discussion</a>, as even older rumors from September theorize that Google could place the exact same Tensor G4 in the 10a. However, rumors have gone back and forth on this, with some suggesting a "boosted" version, while others say it'll be a "downgraded" variant. Either way, it looks like we'll have to wait until next year to see what's really going down.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These new plans aren't set to kick off until "early 2026," per the post; however, it's teasing what's to come by revealing the contents of its YouTube TV Sports Plan. In this, consumers are set to receive access to major sports broadcasters through its service, such as NBC Sports Network and FS1.</p><p>The platform states this plan will also include "all" ESPN Networks and ESPN Unlimited.</p><p>While the aforementioned broadcasters and services are the meat and potatoes of the Sports Plan, YouTube TV says it will provide a few add-ons, as well. If you're looking for more, consumers can add the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> and RedZone to the Sports Plan for even more NFL action, likely in preparation for the 2026-2027 season next September. Multiview, unlimited DVR, and more will be included.</p><p>As YouTube TV stated, the goal of these new "plans" is to give users the ability to tailor their viewing experience. The platform plans to expand this with 10 genre-specific packages next year. This Sports Plan is just one of them, as the post teases the consumer's ability to combine sports and news, focus on family entertainment, focus on sports, or anything else that grabs your attention.</p><h2 id="this-could-ve-been-different-and-it-probably-is-2">This could've been different, and it probably is</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua" name="YouTube-TV-Disney-Plus-apps" alt="YouTube TV and Disney Plus apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isjGcKtXArcr87cxJ9vkua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to gloss over what's transpired between YouTube TV and Disney (after that whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">negotiation battle</a>), as ESPN is a major part of this Sports Plan. While talks have concluded positively for the viewer, there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tvs-espn-unlimited-win-has-one-major-catch-for-baseball-fans">a huge catch for baseball fans</a>: the MLB.TV package is gone. YouTube TV is allowed to keep ESPN after settling with Disney, but a strong catalyst for viewing baseball games was excluded.</p><p>The MLB.TV package is headed into the ESPN app next year; however, this integration removes its offering from third parties, like YouTube TV. The new rights agreement with MLB gives ESPN full control over out-of-market games.</p><p>If things went differently, perhaps MLB.TV would've been included in YouTube TV's Sports Plan, but who knows. It's also quite timely that YouTube TV has announced this Sports Plan (and its new plans in general), considering it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disneys-channels-return-to-youtube-tv-after-intense-negotiations">Disney's channels returned</a> roughly a month ago.</p><p>After two long weeks, the two finally reached an agreement, bringing back 21 channels to consumers who were growing tired of the back and forth.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Mosseri, this will let users "see and control" what content is produced for them in Reels. Instagram reportedly leverages its AI software to show users what it believes they're interested in. If you're ever wondering<em> why </em>you're seeing the Reels you are, this will give you the insight you need.</p><p>In Mosseri's video, he explains that users can head into "Your Algorithm" and fine-tune this as needed.</p><p>This feature is rolling out today (Dec 10) for the U.S., and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/reels-algorithm-control">a subsequent blog post</a> went further, detailing more. When in Reels, users will soon notice an icon at the top right (it looks like two hearts on separate tracks). From there, you can see "Your Algorithm," a quick overview of what Instagram's AI believes you like to see. Users will notice two important categories: "what you want to see more of" and "what you want to see less of."</p><p>The former includes everything the AI already thinks you like, and you can add or subtract topics from there. The latter, what you want less of, is for topics you don't want to see while scrolling through Reels. The recommendations Instagram gives you will "adapt" to whatever you've set in Your Algorithm. Lastly, the post states users can "share" their interests, which is the short AI-generated blurb that sums it all up.</p><p>Mosseri adds that there's interest in a "world where there's transparency and control" with what the user sees on Instagram.</p><h2 id="it-s-your-algorithm-2">It's your algorithm</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1091px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="cVJ7EzT8sxxLZsu9TpdeQh" name="instagram-your-algorithm-announced" alt="Instagram rolls out "Your Algorithm" for users to see and even alter what its AI software thinks they're interested in, for an app that shows exactly what they want." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVJ7EzT8sxxLZsu9TpdeQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1091" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is just the beginning for Instagram. Mosseri's announcement post adds that while Reels is the first, there's work to be done to bring "Your Algorithm" to the main Instagram feed and the search tab. The inclusion of the search tab is said to specifically show things you've added.</p><p>U.S. users are the first to receive this in Reels today; however, the company is already looking to bring it to more English speakers globally "soon."</p><p>Instagram's AI has been busy recently, as the platform started leaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">on its software to identify teen users</a>. The purpose is to help activate its teen-focused protections for younger users on the platform. It was stated that the AI would flag underage users even if their birthdays claim they're an adult. If flagged, Instagram's Teen Account settings will be automatically applied, closing off who can contact them and controlling the content they see.</p><div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media"  data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSFa4TvEgUU/" target="_blank">A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div> ]]></dc:content>

Several long-running fitness programs are being pulled as Samsung prepares to roll out a new version of the app.</p><p>As first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-health-lose-some-content-with-new-version-app/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the tech giant is releasing a new update this December that not only adds features but also removes some existing ones. The company has started notifying Samsung Health users that specific content within the Fitness tab is on the chopping block.</p><p>The company hasn’t offered a warm explanation, but the move aligns with Samsung’s gradual pivot toward streamlined Health integrations across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> and Galaxy Watches, as well as upcoming AI-driven features.</p><p>As a result, most of the content being removed is older material and downloadable files. Notices to users say the new Samsung Health app, coming this month, will stop offering "programs offered through downloads" in the Fitness Program section.</p><p>Also, any programs uploaded before December 31, 2022, will be removed from the service. This points to a major cleanup, as Samsung clears out old data to make space for new, likely cloud-based features.</p><p>Don’t worry about losing all your favorite routines. The notice makes it clear that content available for real-time streaming will stay. If you use the newer streaming classes from Samsung’s partners, those will still be there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="FB5XE7mASvbahSqpE2JvUb" name="Samsung-Health-app-notification" alt="notification in the Samsung Health app about the removal of downloadable content services" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FB5XE7mASvbahSqpE2JvUb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="YEhsp4a9UXtVMBqf9DnNVb" name="Samsung-Health-app-notification" alt="notification in the Samsung Health app about the removal of downloadable content services" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEhsp4a9UXtVMBqf9DnNVb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="why-this-is-happening-now-2">Why this is happening now</h2><p>This update is happening alongside the launch of One UI 8.5, Samsung’s latest software version.

I'm talking about RAM (Random Access Memory), which is used to store data for processes running right now, not for storage like a hard drive. Some need more memory than others.</p><p>The data centers that power AI (including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-phone-hardware-does-it-take-for-good-fast-ai">tiny one that lives inside your phone</a>) are <em>especially</em> hungry for memory. They need it to store parts of a solution in progress while the rest is being calculated, as well as to prefetch data from storage that a piece of AI software might need fast access to. That's why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have so much RAM inside them now. They need it.</p><p>Turns out AI data centers are demanding so much memory that some manufacturers are even leaving the consumer business to focus on the giant orders that can make a lot more profit. Google might only need 12GB of memory to make a phone, but it needs hundreds of megabytes for every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-carbon-capture-initiative-a-savior-or-a-smokescreen">data center server</a>. It makes sense for companies to try to supply bigger clients.</p><p>The problem is that this is not the same type or configuration of RAM used in things like a phone or even a consumer PC.  Semiconductor suppliers have to focus on what's profitable.</p><h2 id="supply-and-demand-2">Supply and demand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XB3dqe5yoQBH2eooh6WDhR" name="Ultrahuman-factory-tour-quality-control-scan" alt="An Ultrahuman factory worker sits at a station for examining the external components of a Ring Air for defects." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XB3dqe5yoQBH2eooh6WDhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone still wants or needs a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a>. That's never going to change unless technology advances to a point where something else can tackle everything your smartphone can do.</p><p>Let's use some easy numbers for an example here. There are 100 people who want to buy a new phone. There are 500 data center computers that need memory. A semiconductor manufacturer can only make 500 products in total.</p><p>Existing contracts say it has to supply a phone maker with 85 modules. It's going to fulfill that contract, then focus on the data center orders because they are more profitable. It's also going to raise prices because the entire company has to work harder to fulfill <strong>every</strong> order, so component prices are going to increase.</p><p>Your favorite phone maker can only make 85 of the phones it wants to sell; those cost more to manufacture, and since fewer are made than customers want to buy, demand will be high.</p><p>In the end, you will pay more.</p><p>A substantial amount more, according to companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/advanced-memory-prices-likely-to-double-as-dram-crunch-spreads-on-nvidia-pivot-structural-factors">Counterpoint Research</a>, which says that memory prices will climb another 30% in the last part of 2025 and an additional 20% early next year. If the memory inside your next phone costs 50% more, that's going to lead to a noticeable price increase. You know the consumer is <em><strong>always</strong></em> the one who pays price increases in the end.</p><p>Some, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53965725">IDC, </a>claim this will affect sales, and demand is expected to decrease in 2026. That makes sense; fewer people will buy a new phone if it's too expensive and their current phone still works.</p><p>Unfortunately, cheaper budget models will be hit the hardest because there just isn;t a lot of pre-built profit margin in them. According to IDC, "<em>the average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $465 in 2026, compared to $457 in 2025,  putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $578.9 billion</em>."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Cheap Android phones</a> are consumer staples. Enthusiasts are fine with paying upwards of $1,000 or more for the latest and greatest, but for most people, that's overkill. A good, cheap Android phone will do everything you need a smartphone to do, it just lacks a few bells and whistles. Starting at the tail end of this year, those phones won't be as cheap because they cost more to make. For there to be any profit in manufacturing an inexpensive phone, prices have to rise to account for it.</p><h2 id="i-think-this-will-only-get-worse-2">I think this will only get worse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DeUXUdZ4RHNJfzA6Mh79VY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-deals-money-01.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 with US dollars" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeUXUdZ4RHNJfzA6Mh79VY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thirst for AI is unlikely to diminish in 2026. We're also unlikely to see any new companies with the capacity to manufacture millions of DRAM modules spring up in just a year.</p><p>I'm betting prices will keep climbing as demand grows. A small decrease in smartphone shipments won't make much of a difference. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are going to keep spending trillions on new data centers until they have a reason to stop, which isn't likely to happen in just a year.</p><p>And we can't lay the blame on any one thing. It's hard to build data servers and equally hard to fabricate memory for them all. It's easy to hate AI for this, but there is demand for the useful things it can do now and in the foreseeable future. Things like medical research or safer aircraft, not just for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">fixing your blurry pictures</a>.</p><p>That doesn't change any of it, though, and we should expect phone prices to climb until they reach a point where we stop buying them. Are you willing to give up using a smartphone because it costs $100 more than it did when you last bought one? How about $200? Or are you going to use what you have for another year and grumble when the time to buy finally arrives?</p><p>I know that I'm going to try and shop smarter and be a little more frugal because of rising prices, and I expect many of you to feel the same way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, Google rolled out a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-it-easier-to-see-stories-from-sites-you-trust">allowed users to mark their favorite news</a> outlets and publications as Preferred Sources, so they would appear higher in search results when users looked up trending topics.</p><p>The feature was originally limited to the United States and India. Today, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/tools-partnerships-web-ecosystem/">announced</a> that it's expanding Preferred Sources to all English-language users starting this week and to all languages early next year. The company says that when someone marks an outlet as a Preferred Source, they tend to click that site twice as much on average, so now more users will benefit from this feature.</p><p>By the way, if you love Android Central's coverage, you can easily mark us as a Preferred Source in Google by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com">clicking this link</a>.</p><h2 id="preferred-sources-expand-to-all-english-language-users-2">Preferred Sources expand to all English language users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XsQsjJWTb9jswCPgdmAXx5" name="google-ai-mode-contextual-results" alt="Contextual text section in AI Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsQsjJWTb9jswCPgdmAXx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, Google will start surfacing the websites you're paying for more often across Gemini, AI Mode, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-overviews-led-users-astray-some-phone-numbers-are-scams-report">AI Overviews</a>. The company says it's rolling out a new feature that highlights links from your paid subscriptions, making them easier to spot when you're using AI Mode or asking Gemini about a trending topic.</p><p>Google has also been criticized for reducing users' clicks to websites they used to visit but now rely on AI Mode for. To address this, the company is rolling out an update that will more prominently highlight links to the web in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-just-made-searching-on-mobile-a-lot-more-chatty">AI Mode</a>. Google says it's launching updates to how links appear in AI Mode so users can interact with those pages more easily. You'll also start seeing more inline links.</p><p>In simple terms, with these updates, Google is giving users more control over how they consume news and from which sources while also helping ensure those outlets see more engagement, even if you primarily use AI Mode to stay informed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A little over six years later, the South Korean behemoth has done it again with the (somewhat) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">surprising unveiling</a> of the Galaxy Z Trifold. Samsung's first dual-hinge foldable, the Galaxy Z TriFold, represents the next evolution of the foldable form factor. While it's not the first device of its kind (that honor belongs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a>), it's undoubtedly the first that'll be available in multiple regions around the globe.</p><p>That's all very exciting, but just how big of an upgrade is it over the Galaxy Z Fold 7? Does it really make sense to get a first-generation product just for a bigger screen (and a few other improvements), or should you buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has been perfected over the years and is arguably the finest dual-screen flagship smartphone currently available out there?</p><p>Let's take a speculative look at Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Galaxy Fold 7 and see how the chaebol's two heavyweights stack up against each other.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-design-displays-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7: Design, displays, and hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-7" alt="Two Galaxy Z TriFolds next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> share many similarities in their overall design, to the point that the two are nearly indistinguishable when folded. Both have the same boxy yet sturdy construction with flat sides, an 'Armor Aluminum' frame, and a 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED LTPO cover display that's secured by a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2.</p><p>The triple-lens primary camera setup is also the same on both foldables, with the three lenses housed inside a vertical pill-shaped island. The Galaxy Z TriFold comes with a 'ceramic-glass fiber reinforced polymer' back that Samsung claims is more resistant to cracks, although we don't know (yet) how durable it is when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> rear of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. You also get an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-waterproof">IP48 certification</a> with both smartphones for dust and water resistance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4710px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HrjiJTBsqCCTWYUXcbaxXf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deck-ledge-angled" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 bridge angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HrjiJTBsqCCTWYUXcbaxXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4710" height="2649" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to weight and dimensions (when closed), the Galaxy Z TriFold is quite a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is to be expected. However, once you open those two inward-folding side panels, you realize just how impossibly slim Samsung's freshest foldable is. Due to each of its three panels varying slightly in their thickness, the TriFold measures just 3.9mm at its thinnest point. That is plain bonkers, even if the Fold 7 with its 4.2mm thickness is no less impressive!</p><p>That being said, the biggest highlight (quite literally!) of the Galaxy Z TriFold is its gargantuan 10-inch inner display. Although it comes with a lower pixel density and peak brightness than the 8-inch inner screen of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the larger panel gives you a lot more visual real estate for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">split-view multitasking</a>, multimedia consumption, gaming, and just about everything else.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (Closed)</p></td><td  ><p>159.2 x 75.0 x 12.9 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (Opened)</p></td><td  ><p>159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9-4.2 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (Cover), Ceramic-Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (Back), Armor Aluminum Frame</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 (Cover), Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (Back), Armor Aluminum Frame</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>309g</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Inner)</p></td><td  ><p>10.0-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1584x2160 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>8.0-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1968x2184 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Outer)</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080x2520 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1080x2520 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite (for Galaxy)</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite (for Galaxy)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyroscope, Geomagnetic sensor, Hall sensor, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyroscope, Geomagnetic sensor, Hall sensor, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), LTE, Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, and USB 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), LTE, Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, and USB 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Dual-SIM/Multi-eSIM, Knox Vault, Samsung DeX standalone, Galaxy AI</p></td><td  ><p>Dual-SIM/Multi-eSIM, Knox Vault, Samsung DeX experience, Galaxy AI</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>5,600mAh (Li-Ion), 45W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, reverse wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh (Li-Ion), 25W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, 12MP ultrawide | 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, 12MP ultrawide | 8K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP | 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP | 4K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Color Options</p></td><td  ><p>Crafted Black</p></td><td  ><p>Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow, Jetblack, and Mint (online-exclusive)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Driven by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> (for Galaxy) chipset, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a powerhouse that can make quick work of just about anything you throw at it, something that Android Central's Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">noted in his review</a>.

You get a 200MP wide-angle primary sensor, a 10MP telephoto module with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide unit, complete with usual goodies such as optical image stabilization, up to 8K video recording, and more shooting modes than you can shake a stick at. Photos and videos pack plenty of detail, with colors and contrast levels on point.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold should deliver equally stellar performance, as the foldable carries over the same primary camera array with no changes.

Then you have the standalone DeX support, which means you no longer need to connect the phone to a monitor to get a desktop-like experience.</p><p>Thanks to its larger 16:11 aspect-ratio inner display, the Galaxy Z TriFold can double as a monitor whenever you want. In summation, this phone-tablet hybrid is the ideal device for on-the-go productivity.

Representing a huge leap in mobile computing, it's a premium hybrid that lets you not just consume content but also create it.</p><p>But even with all that, it's still a first-generation product. Moreover, it's likely to cost a fortune at launch, even if Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-might-cost-way-less-than-expected-leaker-claims" target="_blank">prices</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-might-cost-way-less-than-expected-leaker-claims"> it conservatively</a>. The Galaxy Fold 7 isn't exactly cheap either, but it's a far more refined foldable that doesn't have a lot of compromises. So, which one should you get?</p><p>The answer depends on what you really use your smartphone for, and of course, your budget. If you're a casual user who sometimes wants to have access to a bigger screen for things like watching videos and editing a document or two, the Galaxy Fold 7 is the right choice. It's still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> (regardless of form factor) in the business and has just about everything you could want from a flagship.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're often juggling multiple devices (e.g., a tablet and a laptop) on the go and want to streamline your workflow a bit, the Galaxy Z TriFold might just help you do so.

While these are certainly the best pair Viture has made to date, a few missing features are holding them back from true greatness.</p><p>But before we jump into that, let's go over what Viture Luma Ultra is and how it's different from the rest of Viture's crowded smart glasses lineup. In summary, Luma Ultra upgrades the Luma Pro experience by adding a brighter display, two additional cameras, and 6DoF tracking. Viture launched its Luma series first with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist">Viture Luma Pro back in July</a>, marking the first pair of smart glasses from the company to ship with a built-in camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Viture Luma Ultra upgrades the experience with three total cameras: one in the nose bridge and two on the outer sides of each lens. This enables Viture Luma Ultra to provide full 6DoF spatial tracking, so virtual screens float in place no matter how much you move or walk around. The trick is that you have to use Viture's Spacewalker software to make 6DoF work.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="39x9WVRarhwDHjaZdyssbB" name="viture-luma-ultra-wearing-02" alt="Wearing Viture Luma Ultra smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39x9WVRarhwDHjaZdyssbB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, it feels like Viture is still stuck in the past, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> can do 6DoF with <em>any</em> device that outputs video, no software required. You need the extra Xreal Eye camera on those glasses, but the final cost is still less than Viture Luma Pro, making it tough to recommend Luma Pro if you're just going for a straight plug-and-play pair of smart display glasses.</p><p>This plug-and-play nature makes Xreal One a better recommendation for nearly anyone, though some folks may prefer Viture for a few reasons. Viture Luma Pro sports the brightest Sony micro-OLED displays on the market, with up to 1500 nits of DC-dimmed brightness (no PWM). That's great for specific scenarios where the automatic lens tinting isn't enough to offset bright environmental light, but I haven't found a scenario in my personal life where this is needed.</p><p>Viture's Spacewalker software is also substantially more full-featured than anything Xreal offers, so while Xreal One is a better plug-and-play pair, Viture Luma Pro offers more options for power users through the smartphone or PC/Mac apps, like quick shortcuts and multiple tracked windows. That makes it feel more like a VR headset because of the capability.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

around with but is mostly relegated to the company's own tech demos and short games for now. I wouldn't buy the glasses for this feature, even if it turned out to be cool.</p><p>The real reason for buying Viture over the competition is twofold: automatic 3D videos and wide ecosystem compatibility. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW/">Viture's Pro Mobile Dock</a> makes it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">use these glasses with a Switch 2</a>, something <em>no other smart glasses brand</em> can claim, thanks to Nintendo's infamous hardware lockdowns. Xreal should soon have an answer to this with the Xreal Neo adapter, but that isn't available yet and doesn't have an official release date.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTE2qJktBmR7iSGuJFd5if" name="viture-luma-pro-front-center-camera" alt="Viture Luma Pro's single camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTE2qJktBmR7iSGuJFd5if.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FDxfBm9jJrqimU4RDGWmgf" name="viture-luma-ultra-cameras-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra's side cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDxfBm9jJrqimU4RDGWmgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AJa2Ls2R335RZomHVYJGhf" name="viture-luma-ultra-diopter-adjustment-wheels-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra diopter adjustments" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJa2Ls2R335RZomHVYJGhf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9zvRFso8LEHvLqJLNt9gif" name="viture-luma-ultra-front-center-camera" alt="Viture Luma Ultra's center camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zvRFso8LEHvLqJLNt9gif.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hHvVXXuvcvoShSAEvYpYif" name="viture-luma-ultra-with-box-01" alt="Viture Luma Ultra smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHvVXXuvcvoShSAEvYpYif.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The other reason to get them is Viture's Immersive 3D video, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">which I tested a few months ago</a> and found to be utter voodoo magic. Viture's Spacewalker app automatically converts <strong>any</strong> video to 3D using onboard AI processing, and it works almost flawlessly. The UI is a bit clunky at times, but nothing else on the market offers this functionality, and it's phenomenal for anyone wanting 3D content without an official source.</p><p>If you want easy plug-and-play spatial tracking that works with any device, Xreal One or Xreal One Pro are the best picks. If you want broader ecosystem compatibility and more power-user settings for features like 3D video or multi-monitor support, Viture Pro or Ultra are great choices. I just wish Viture could support spatial tracking without requiring additional software.</p><h2 id="viture-luma-x-cyberpunk-2077-2">Viture Luma x Cyberpunk 2077</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eBCQ9QxTJf8E4ccZAYpBx4" name="viture-luma-cyberpunk-2077-official-render-02" alt="An official product render of Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eBCQ9QxTJf8E4ccZAYpBx4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cyberpunk fans may be thrilled to know that Viture and CD Projekt Red have teamed up to make a limited edition Cyberpunk 2077-themed pair of Luma glasses.

The headset was pretty much tailor-made for newcomers to VR gaming, boasting the same graphical processing power as the standard Quest 3 at a significantly lower cost.</p><p>In fact, as described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Quest 3S is "quite literally a Quest 3 with the Quest 2's lenses and display". Starting at $299, the beginner-friendly VR headset also boasts upgraded hand tracking and low light tracking capabilities, next-gen controllers, and complete access to the same library of games as the more-expensive Meta Quest 3. Furthermore, the device is powered by the cutting-edge Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and comes with 8GB of RAM straight out of the box.</p><p>Sure, if you directly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">compare the Meta Quest 3S with the standard Quest 3</a>, you'll notice that the more affordable model has a lower-res display and narrower field-of-view than its premium counterpart, but you're also paying at least $200 less for it. In other words, if you're trying to get into VR gaming for the first time, the Meta Quest 3S is the best way to do it for cheap, <em>especially</em> when you slap on a $50 no-strings discount from Walmart.</p><h2 id="holiday-deals-2025-quick-links-2">Holiday deals 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Both of these specifications are shocking when you consider that the tablet barely weighs over a pound (469 grams). </p><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 also comes with an S Pen stylus, while the first-party keyboard case (included with your purchase from Samsung.com) is a quick and easy way to convert your tablet into a laptop whenever you want. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XdX3gXQJnkFxVyvvcPWmgX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 in between two Samsung Galaxy S25 FE models." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdX3gXQJnkFxVyvvcPWmgX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-galaxy-tab-s11-from-samsung-or-amazon-2">Should I buy the Galaxy Tab S11 from Samsung or Amazon?</h2><p>While Amazon may be offering the Galaxy Tab S11 at the same price (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Android-Display-Performance-Note-Taking/dp/B0FGKN976K"><strong>$759.99 without trade-in</strong></a>), there are a few reasons you should consider buying the tablet directly from the source.</p><p>As I mentioned above, purchasing the device through <strong>Samsung.com</strong> will get you a free Book Cover Keyboard Slim case.

When a user makes an emergency call, the connected dispatcher now has the option of requesting a live video feed from your Android phone. This can help emergency dispatchers better assess your situation, send the right first responders, or guide you through live-saving steps, according to Google.</p><p>Emergency Live Video is enabled by default, and requires no manual setup. The tool is available any time an emergency call or text is initiated from an Android phone. Emergency Live Video is requested by the dispatcher when necessary, and when requested, Android users will see a <strong>Share live video?</strong> prompt on their device. They can choose <strong>No thanks</strong> or <strong>Share</strong> to start streaming video from their camera with a single tap.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QUjM7w3whU2sYtyxZx8hqW" name="Android-Emergency-Live-Video-3" alt="The steps for using Android Emergency Live Video." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUjM7w3whU2sYtyxZx8hqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once shared, Emergency Live Video is a live feed with an interface that can be minimized while users take other important actions on their device. Emergency Live Video supports flipping the camera to show emergency dispatchers the best angle, and there's a large <strong>Stop sharing</strong> button that can end the live feed immediately.</p><p>Google says Emergency Live Video is built to be "simple and secure," and it's completely optional. "The feature is encrypted by default, and you are always in control of whether your video is shared, and can stop sharing instantly at any time," the company explains.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iAdW6LF5RyFbkxTDRHzrRi" name="Android-Emergency-Live-Video-2" alt="Android Emergency Live Video on a Pixel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iAdW6LF5RyFbkxTDRHzrRi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Emergency Live Video is the Android equivalent of Apple's Emergency SOS live video, which was added to the iPhone 14 and later with iOS 18.

The feature will work on Android phones running Android 8 or higher with Google Play Services, meaning it's supported on most models still in use today.</p><p>Emergency Live Video expands the emergency video recording feature available on Google Pixel phones, and brings the versatile option to all Android phones.

So, if an important app sends a generic promo code, the system can mark it as junk but still let urgent messages through.</p><p>You get four primary categories where these low-priority pings are sequestered: Promotions and News are enabled by default, while Social and Suggested options require a manual toggle. Rather than filling up your main feed, these notifications are grouped in the Silent section of your shade, marked with an AI sparkle icon.</p><h2 id="flagship-exclusive-for-now-2">Flagship exclusive for now</h2><p>Although the feature is part of the December 2025 rollout, it is exclusive to the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> lineups, with the budget-friendly Pixel 9a excluded.</p><p>Before searching for the feature, check that you are in a supported region. The rollout is happening in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Japan, and it only works if your system language is set to English.</p><p>If you have a supported device, the option might not show up right away, even after updating your software. Restarting your phone can make the feature appear.</p><p>Once it is available, go to Settings, then Notifications, and then Notification Organizer to adjust your preferences. You can turn on extra categories or enable 'Always expand bundles' if you want to see more at a glance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung will also reportedly equip all accessories with magnets for wireless charging and for attaching mounts.</p><h2 id="a-closer-look-at-samsung-s-new-qi2-accessory-plans-2">A closer look at Samsung's new Qi2 accessory plans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-caseborne-case-01.jpg" alt="The Caseborne clear case with MagSafe magnets for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with every Galaxy S launch, you can expect a wide range of accessories to debut alongside the S26 lineup. According to the leak, Samsung will introduce a premium-feeling Magnetic Carbon Case for the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>In addition to the carbon case, you can also expect magnetic clear cases, magnetic rugged cases, and, for the first time, magnetic silicone cases for all Galaxy S26 phones. However, it appears that the Magnetic Carbon Case will be exclusive to the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S26 Plus, and will not be available for the baseline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26</a>.</p><p>There's also mention of a "dual magnet holder ring" for all models, though for now we don't know what it will be used for.</p><p>Quandt also mentions a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-qi2-charger-leak-suggests-a-magsafe-rival-could-finally-come-to-the-galaxy-s26">new Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack</a> with Qi2 support (model number EB-U2500) that will work similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe power banks</a> we've seen for iPhones. The external power bank will reportedly offer a 5000mAh capacity.</p><p>In addition to this, Quandt says the Galaxy S26 series will also come with a Bluetooth S Pen as an "optional accessory or spare part." Samsung removed Bluetooth support from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-bluetooth-support">Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen</a>, but it appears it might be making a comeback, although it's possible the company may sell the Bluetooth version as an extra purchase.</p><p>The leak also mentions that Samsung will sell anti-reflective screen protectors for all Galaxy S26 models. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> is expected to feature anti-reflective Gorilla Glass out of the box, it's good to see Samsung selling anti-reflective protectors for all models so users can get a similar feel across the lineup.</p><p>The Galaxy S26 series isn't far away now, with the leak mentioning that Samsung is reportedly planning to launch the phones near the end of February 2026, which is different from what we've previously heard. This could be due to the Galaxy S26 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead">replacing the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> late in development. That said, we're only a couple of months away, so things should become clearer as we get closer to launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After sifting through a recent Play Services beta, AssembleDebug was able to (in a way) activate Google's version of Apple's contact sharing feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Y2-LxVx62x0">tipster's video evidence</a> shows how this could work between devices, as they hold one phone atop the other.</p><p>There appears to be some distance between phones; however, an almost creamsicle-colored animation appears shortly after.</p><p>The lights appear along the top portion of both phones, rolling through their rounded corners and down the display partway. The animation will likely appear, alongside the contact information you've shared and received. The animation recedes to the punch hole selfie camera once the process is completed.</p><p>NFC still appears to play a major part in this contact exchange, but, as the tipster states, it's unclear just how reliant on it the feature will be. As development progresses, the tipster speculates that NFC could simply kickstart the feature before throwing things over to a user's Bluetooth or even Wi-Fi connectivity for the rest.</p><h2 id="one-tap-done-2">One tap, done</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG" name="android-apple-namedrop-like-feature-progress-leak" alt="Google's version of Apple's NameDrop leaked again, showcasing bright, cream-colored animation along the top portion of the phone during the sharing process." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second time Google's version of Apple's NameDrop has appeared in rumors.

The code called the feature a "Gesture Exchange," while other important code bits highlighted its reliance on NFC.

The post alleges some details about the tracker's upgrades, stating the Moto Tag 2 could boast a stronger, longer-lasting battery than its first iteration. Moreover, the company could equip the next tracker with increased location precision, alongside "better button tactility."</p><p>Ultrawide band connectivity (UWB), IP67 dust and water protection are rumored for the next tracker. The publication reportedly obtained the alleged promotional material for the Moto Tag 2, showing off its updated design.</p><p>Per the image, the Moto Tag 2 is seemingly preparing to arrive in two colors: a peach option and an almost cream-colored version, too. Additionally, the rendering suggests the main body of the tracker could remain the same. The render shows a raised portion on the tracker's button (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">like the first model</a>). The image then highlights a punch hole at the top.</p><p>What's unclear about this is whether it's a loophole for a string to slide through or, perhaps, a more pronounced tiny speaker.</p><h2 id="tagged-but-with-a-2-2">Tagged, but with a 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:471px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.39%;"><img id="KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH" name="motorola-moto-tag-2-alleged-render" alt="An alleged rendering of the Moto Tag 2 from Motorola, which retains a similar design to the first iteration with a raised portion for its physical button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="471" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot of interest around Motorola's first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">Bluetooth tracker when it launched</a> in the summer of 2024. The company sought to make a bold statement in a market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">with multiple options</a>. The original launched with a small and sleek design, which we're expecting Motorola to continue with the second generation, if the rumors are to be believed. Motorola launched its Tag with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">Find My Device network</a> compatibility, meaning Android users anywhere could utilize its capabilities.</p><p>The Tag's battery is estimated to last users a whole year before needing a replacement.

The phone's alleged renders make it look similar to its 2025 counterpart, though it might swap its glass back for an "eco-leather" material. The same mid-range RAM/storage options are suspected, but there could be more in store for its battery capacity. The publication claims that this Moto Tag 2 might even debut with the G Stylus in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Kicking off the phone's reveal is the "Made Together" campaign, which Nothing states, "celebrates the design process and collaboration within the Nothing community." The design language of this campaign represents "making tech fun to inspire human creativity." It credits campaign winner, Sushruta Sarkar, for taking charge here.</p><p>According to Nothing, the winning design for the Phone 3a goes to one of its campaign creators, Emre Kayganacl. This was "stage one" in the development process, as Kayganacl spearheaded the Phone 3a's new aesthetic with a "late 90s and early 2000s technology" theme. The Phone 3a's Community Edition takes on this light blue color, which Nothing says reminds it of old game toys (think Game Boy).</p><p>Joining the Phone 3a is an accessory: dice. Nothing states that while dice typically represent chance in gaming and more, it paired this Phone 3a'a accessory with dice that feature its Ndot 55 font. Ambrogio Tacconi and Louis Aymond took charge of this particular development aspect.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMYoXTO4mHI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The final aspect of the Phone 3a, bringing it all home, is its lock screen and wallpaper design. Nothing states the device's new design, led by Jad Zock, "reduces visual clutter and guides the eye intuitively to the key components." The company also states that consumers interested in the phone will find that the design still ensures users get all the information they need quickly without forgetting.</p><p>Nothing credits Jad Zock's design as one that seamlessly merges the rear design with its digital aesthetic. Users will find four versions of this wallpaper available (two blue, two purple) as well as a few easter eggs.</p><h2 id="the-community-edition-is-here-2">The Community Edition is here</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-dice-accessory" alt="The Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition is paired with an accessory: dice, which features the company's classic font for the numbers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-wallpaper" alt="Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition wallpaper blends its rear design with its digital screen seamlessly for a retro aesthetic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As stated previously, Nothing is only creating 1,000 Phone 3a Community Editions for consumers in a 12/256GB variant.

Android Central's Senior Editor, Nicholas Sutrich, got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. This package did give us a peek into what Motorola could have in store at CES, a possible new flagship device that could look a lot like a book-style foldable, much like the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now hear us out, there were several clues within the package that just screamed that this new form factor could be in the works. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device also might feature a wooden finish, suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY" name="motorola-ces-2026-fold-teaser-01" alt="Motorola sent us a teaser package that screams something exciting is brewing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Considering, Motorola is the only company that likes to experiment with unique materials such as bamboo, teak, ebony, and walnut wood in its smartphone designs, since the <em>Moto X</em> days (starting around 2013-2014), where the company allowed users to fully customize their devices. And more recently, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025,  Mountain Trail edition</a>, which featured thin wood inlay.</p><p>The lamp's mechanism is such that it unfolds end-to-end, with its pages illuminated in a red hue; however, it remains unclear whether the foldable device will operate just like the lamp, which only time will tell. Until then, we're just letting our imaginations run wild about the kind of device Motorola is brewing for us(a Fold with a wooden back?), set to be unveiled on January 6, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From using ready-made templates, a redesigned video editor, to adding music and custom text, the tech giant is bringing five new features to make these reels more personal.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2298px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.40%;"><img id="u67pFnVwivG7sKDFZdgWvk" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos' video editor gets a glow up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u67pFnVwivG7sKDFZdgWvk.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2298" height="1342" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2298px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.40%;"><img id="tKJmsHs9v6tfyLbhaf3j2m" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos' video editor gets a glow up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tKJmsHs9v6tfyLbhaf3j2m.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2298" height="1342" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Photos will show you different templates to pick from, giving you a creative push for your highlight reel if you don't know where to begin. The platform has significantly updated its editor to be more user-friendly and intuitive, giving it a major glow-up.  The enhanced editor supports multi-clip editing and storytelling, and also includes an "adaptive canvas" to simplify the editing process, like switching around clips within the video or adjusting the length of the video clip, all in one place.</p><p>Additionally, users will be able to edit and customize each video clip within the reel by adding music or custom text to it as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LGrEzFj8o2WP8L6z8YYJMC" name="Google-Photos-video-update" alt="Google Photos brings nifty video editing tools" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGrEzFj8o2WP8L6z8YYJMC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of having it all in one place, users will also be able to add audio from the Photos’ music library and pick the perfect track that adds "emotion or brings out the right vibe to your highlight video on Android and iOS."</p><p>Google Photos is adding text editing features, basically ditching the need to switch to other applications like Instagram or TikTok. Users on Android can now utilize "stylish text overlays" for their highlight videos, with customizable options for fonts, colors, and backgrounds to make their message prominent.</p><p>Google says these editing tools will begin rolling out today (Dec.9), so you can give them a go within the Photos app.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you bought one, you likely did it for the cameras or the AI smarts, not because the Tensor G5 would beat the Snapdragon 8 Elite in speed tests. But the Pixel 10 is apparently getting faster, not from new hardware, but thanks to some quiet software changes.</p><p>The latest round of updates, including the December Android 16 QPR2 release, is apparently giving the Pixel 10 a noticeable boost in day-to-day responsiveness, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr2-performance-test-3622602/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>It’s an interesting twist for a phone that launched with promising hardware but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">caught early criticism for GPU performance</a> that lagged behind Snapdragon-powered rivals. Now, Google seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">clawing back some of that ground with pure software optimization</a>, and some folks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pdyykp/something_has_changed_pixel_10_gpu_performance/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> seem to have noticed it too.</p><h2 id="more-than-a-tune-up-2">More than a tune-up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android 16’s QPR2 update might not seem major at first, but it does more than just change the look of the interface. Early tests show that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> with QPR2 gets about a 5% boost in both multi-core CPU and peak GPU scores.</p><p>The real surprise is in everyday use: PCMark Work 3.0 scores went up by nearly 20%, which suggests Google improved task scheduling in ways users will notice.</p><p>The changes aren’t dramatic, and the Pixel 10 still isn’t built for gaming, but the phone does feel smoother, according to the report. Performance isn’t the only improvement, though. QPR2 also adds system-wide refinements like customizable launcher icon shapes, a better widget panel, improved HDR brightness control, and many fixes for battery, Bluetooth, camera, and display issues.</p><p>This December patch bundles in over 30 security and bug fixes, tightening up the software foundation the Pixel 10 runs on.</p><p>The bigger takeaway is what this means for Google’s update strategy. Rather than waiting for yearly Android releases to boost performance, Google is now adding real improvements in quarterly updates. If this continues, the Pixel line could hold up much better over time than the first-generation Tensor devices did.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/902/631.htm" target="_blank">new report</a> from China suggests the company is quietly tightening its regional strategy and pulling back from a global rollout of its in-house chip (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_now_said_to_be_using_the_exynos_2600_in_the_galaxy_s26_series_in_just_one_market-news-70592.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>This change probably has to do with how the Exynos 2600 is performing in development. The chip should use Samsung’s improved 3nm GAP process, with a custom CPU and a new Xclipse GPU made with AMD. Samsung hopes this mix will finally deliver better thermal stability, stronger on-device AI, and improved power management.</p><p>But none of those improvements may reach buyers outside Samsung’s home market. Instead, only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> and S26 Plus in Korea are expected to be Exynos-powered, while global variants switch entirely to Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.</p><h2 id="competition-could-have-forced-samsung-s-hand-2">Competition could have forced Samsung's hand?</h2><p>The reasoning behind this pivot is unclear, but it’s not hard to guess. The company has been working to restore trust in its Exynos chips after past issues with battery life and heat. By limiting the Exynos 2600 to Korea, Samsung can test its progress at home without risking more criticism from global users.</p><p>Competition may be another factor. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, with its new Oryon CPU, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-benchmarks-reveal-qualcomms-dominance-yet-again">is a big upgrade</a>. Using Snapdragon worldwide could help Samsung keep performance steady across all S26 models, especially in benchmarks and heat management, which are crucial in the high-end market.</p><p>If the report is accurate, the Galaxy S26 will launch with two different chips again. Korean customers will get Samsung’s latest Exynos, while everyone else will see Qualcomm’s flagship. Still, it’s rare for Samsung to limit Exynos to just one country, since it usually sells Exynos phones worldwide, especially in Europe. So, the final decision on this strategy is still up in the air.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But as the browser becomes more like a personal assistant, Google is working hard to prevent security problems. After all, assistants can be fooled, and that risk is at the heart of Google’s new security changes.</p><p>When Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">first landed in Chrome for U.S. desktop users back in September</a>, it marked the beginning of “agentic browsing,” Google’s term for letting AI take meaningful actions online. Instead of simply responding to prompts, the browser could actually carry out a workflow across pages and tabs.</p><p>However, allowing AI to click buttons and read websites for you is exactly what security experts have warned about. Some malicious sites can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/turns-out-gmails-ai-email-summaries-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought">hide secret instructions in their code or page elements</a>, a method called indirect prompt injection, and use it to control the AI without you knowing.</p><p>To address this, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/architecting-security-for-agentic.html" target="_blank">adding a new safety feature</a> called the user alignment critic, which acts like a built-in gatekeeper for Gemini’s proposed actions. Before the AI executes anything, the action is routed to this model. Instead of reading the webpage directly, the Critic only receives structured metadata that describes what the action will do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.78%;"><img id="wstVSYroo5GrQtpKDDHdLE" name="Chrome-user-alignment-critic" alt="A flow chart that depicts the User Alignment Critic: a trusted component that vets each action before it reaches the browser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wstVSYroo5GrQtpKDDHdLE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1269" height="619" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="action-must-match-intent-2">Action must match intent</h2><p>Isolating the Critic from raw web content prevents a hostile site from manipulating the safety system itself. If an action doesn’t match your stated intent, the Critic blocks it outright. This extra layer in Chrome helps keep the AI working as intended, even if some websites try to interfere.</p><p>This new architecture also expands Chrome’s origin isolation rules so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> can only interact with the specific domains involved in your task. It can’t wander off to unrelated sites or make unexpected network requests.</p><p>Alongside that, Google has layered in threat detection tools, user confirmations for sensitive operations, and aggressive red-teaming before new agentic features roll out. Each piece is meant to reinforce the others, creating a defense-in-depth model that treats AI decision-making as a high-risk environment rather than a novelty feature.</p><p>Google is also putting money on the table to prove it works. The company has updated its Vulnerability Rewards Program, offering up to $20,000 to any researcher who can bypass these new agentic security layers.</p><p>The upgrades arrive as Chrome prepares to ship more agentic capabilities, which means users will soon see Gemini taking more initiative online.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OnePlus went backward on ergonomics with this release and even replaced the trademark OnePlus Alert slider with a generic AI button. Yuck.</p><p>Thankfully, Thinborne's minimalist case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667">is finally available at Amazon</a> and solves several problems that I have with the design. First off, it's a minimalist aramid fiber case, which means its primary function is to provide scratch resistance and add grip to an otherwise slippery phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> isn't slippery by any means — the Micro-Arc Oxidation metal frame has a semi-rough ceramic-like feel — but the boxy nature means it's less comfortable to hold and harder to pick up from a table. This case almost completely fixes that, as the aramid fiber material is more tactile and is just easier to grip and hold, plus the slightly rounded edges make the phone feel more natural in my hands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

All of OnePlus's official cases do too, but this one does it without adding a bunch of bulk to the phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> is still the only major Android phone series with MagSafe built in, and while that's certainly annoying for other brands, at least a minimalist case solves the problem.</p><p>Now, if you've never used a minimalist case before, know that these are <em>not</em> made for dropping. While the IP65/68/69/69K/ABCZYX ingress protection on the OnePlus 15 will protect against all sorts of crazy situations, it won't keep your screen from cracking if it falls down a flight of stairs.</p><p>Now that the display is fully flat — one of the <em>only</em> good design changes this time around — tempered glass protectors work perfectly on the phone and will keep your screen from breaking in most situations. The case also comes with a tempered glass screen protector in the box, but you can always grab some backup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-oneplus-15-screen-protectors">OnePlus 15 screen protectors.</a>  So grab that case, slap on a screen protector, and enjoy a better OnePlus 15 experience for years to come.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f8458d5c-fd17-46aa-90e2-95dd5dc2109a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension48="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension25="$69.69" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:119.02%;"><img id="2NWTPWLfv5QNHrQa3PB5EB" name="thinborne-oneplus-15-case-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NWTPWLfv5QNHrQa3PB5EB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1167" height="1389" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f8458d5c-fd17-46aa-90e2-95dd5dc2109a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension48="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension25="$69.69">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

It felt like the perfect gameplay adaptation of one of my favorite TV shows, and it helped that I could tag along with friends and beat the heck out of the bad guys plaguing NYC.</p><p>Fast forward several decades, and now I'm actually embodying those same Ninja Turtles in a new VR game for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vr.meta.me/s/1L2KRVYie9Nqfgj" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bit.ly/3ZbZwLR" target="_blank">Steam VR,</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bit.ly/4ov46OM" target="_blank">Pico</a> headsets. You can wishlist the game via those links, which is scheduled to come out sometime early in 2026. TMNT: Empire City has been teased since August, and now we finally have the gameplay to understand what you'll be doing in the game.</p><p>In a nutshell (halfshell?), this one's a near-perfect translation of the classic 2D gameplay into a 3D space, giving you full autonomy over your Turtle of choice via freedom of movement offered by a VR headset. Slicing Footclan members with Leo's swords, smacking them on the head with Michaelangelo's nunchucks, wacking them with Donatello's staff, or stabbing them with Raphael's Sai felt as authentic as a comic book come to life could be. It was cathartic in every way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

The storyline in this portion of the game involves all four turtles "gaining ingress" into a building, as Leonardo so eloquently put it, only to have three of them get captured by a heinous villain who works for The Shredder.</p><p>The Turtles apparently think the Footclan and Shredder were supposed to be defeated, but it turns out some dark art is keeping Shredder and his minions from properly entering the afterlife. That's where the turtles come in, although the demo cuts off right as the boss's plans are thwarted.</p><p>You play as each turtle in the tutorial, learning movement tricks, how each weapon works, and how to utterly kick the butts of every Footclan member you come across. You'll climb pipes and walls, jump higher than any human could, and unleash kicks and a fury of weaponry that make you feel exactly like the arcade beat-em-up, just translated into 3D movement.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

sewers of NYC. All the classic moves are here, including the flying jump kick that sees you hopping into the air and pressing the dash button to unleash a devastating thwack to the bad guys.</p><p>The remaining 10 minutes or so of the demo was spent in the Turtle's lair, which acts as the central hub for this pseudo-open-world game. The lair is unmistakable in its design, meticulously crafted and fun to roam around. You can check out all four Turtle's rooms, chat with Master Splinter, plan the next mission with April O'Neal, and head upstairs to craft unlockables throughout your adventures.</p><p>While none of the levels were open for this demo, heading out into the sewers takes you to different parts of the city for butt-kicking mayhem. Based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOJ7vMJxHGY">previous parkour video</a>, it looks like a notable amount of space is traversable, with climbable buildings and fun parkour everywhere. I'm super stoked to play this one with friends and couldn't be more excited to finally get the chance to embody a Ninja Turtle next year!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung first introduced its pinching shortcut on Galaxy Watches with Wear OS 5, while Apple Watches also have a Double Tap shortcut.</p><p>Google seemed to acknowledge this in the press release, noting that "unique to Pixel Watch" will be "helpful context hints right on screen" for when to use the gesture. When you look at an incoming phone call, for example, the green phone button will temporarily switch to an animated pinch gesture.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN" name="Pixel-Watch-4-double-pinch-answer-call" alt="A render of the Pixel Watch 4 showing an incoming phone call screen, with the green Answer button showing a Double Pinch gesture animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2088" height="1175" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="Jbsn5sTFtVJHwRbYHW2BJj" name="Pixel-Watch-4-wrist-turn" alt="A screenshot of the Pixel Watch 4 showing a guide for using the the Wrist Turn one-handed gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jbsn5sTFtVJHwRbYHW2BJj.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-knock-knock-gesture" alt="The Knock Knock gesture screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, worn on the wrist of someone doing the gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Knock Knock gesture on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second new Pixel Watch 4 gesture is Wrist Turn, which silences notifications or incoming calls; this, too, is similar to Samsung's "Shake" gesture and functionality.

The company already has a good track record with its foldables, particularly the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and it appears Samsung is taking what it's learned to deliver an impressively thin phone with impressive specs.</p><p>It measures only 3.9mm at its thinnest point and 12.9mm when folded, making it less than a millimeter thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and slightly thicker than its closest competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">Huawei Mate XTs</a>. It features a 6.5-inch AMOLED cover screen, but flip it around, and it opens to a 10-inch display that looks like a small tablet.</p><p>In fact, while other large-screen foldables are often compared to tablets, this may be the closest thing to one given the wide, rectangular aspect ratio. This should improve the video-watching experience and possibly gaming, too, as there will likely be little or no letterboxing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Galaxy Z TriFold unveiled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> (not the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">8 Elite Gen 5</a>) and 16GB of RAM, which should prove more than enough for most people.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>AI products are often only as good as the prompts a user provides, and crafting the perfect prompt isn't an exact science. It's rare that we hear about what makes a successful AI prompt from an expert on the subject, but Google DeepMind UX Engineer Anna Bortsova is pulling back the curtain in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/meta-prompting-veo-gemini-tips/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Bortsova, whose background is in visual arts and engineering, use a little-known technique called meta prompting to create videos with Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">Veo 3 video-generation model</a>.</p><p>Bortsova doesn't create her own prompts at all — she uses meta prompting to refine prompts with Gemini that are inputted to Flow or the Gemini app, which use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">Veo 3</a>. Instead of writing a detailed video-generation prompt, Bortsova writes a prompt for Gemini.</p><p>Then, Gemini creates detailed video-generation prompts in bulk. By using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, the video-generation prompts used with Veo can be much longer than one a human would create. They can be "multiple pages" and are occasionally generated five to ten at a time, according to Bortsova.</p><p>Here's an example of how the DeepMind engineer creates gen-AI prompts with meta prompting in Gemini:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.40%;"><img id="uyzeS5kZvd66AMnYkopjT4" name="Google-Meta-Prompting" alt="A meta prompting example from Google for Gemini and Veo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uyzeS5kZvd66AMnYkopjT4.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="664" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bortsova says there are "no rules" when it comes to meta prompting, but there are keys to success.</p><div><blockquote><p>You want to define a very specific task: ‘write a detailed prompt that an LLM will understand.’ And you want to be clear about your format and style: say, an 8-second stop-motion animation of paper-engineered scenes. Then give it constraints, like foil paper or shiny paper, rather than just general paper. Then let it do its thing.</p><p>Anna Bortsova, Google DeepMind UX Engineer</p></blockquote></div><p>After the initial prompt, users may want to steer Gemini in the right direction with follow-ups. The best exchanges with Gemini are collaborative, and are back-and-forth in nature. Bortsova also recommends getting emotional in your prompts by suggesting "the feeling you want to evoke."</p><p>Meta prompting is a technique that can be used in a variety of applications beyond video generation. Any time you want to achieve something with AI, it's a good idea to simply ask an AI model how to achieve it. Instead of painstakingly brainstorming the perfect prompt, use meta prompting. Ask Gemini for help creating the prompt that will eventually be re-inputted into the chatbot to complete the task at hand.</p><p>The one tip Bortsova thinks everyone should know? "Pick a subject you love and just start experimenting."</p> ]]></dc:content>

For a long time, if you wanted to keep a photo private, you had to move it to the Secure Folder. The Secure Folder is great for protecting banking apps and important documents, but using it just to hide a few pictures feels unnecessary. You have to unlock a separate, secure area, move the file, and if you want to edit or share it later, you have to move it back to the main gallery.</p><p>Thankfully, that friction might finally be disappearing. With the upcoming One UI 8.5 beta, Samsung is introducing a native "Private album" feature directly inside the Gallery app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-8-5-private-album-feature-explained/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports.</p><h2 id="google-photos-style-security-2">Google Photos-style security</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.24%;"><img id="Wu66RbscoKDJfxkq58q6kR" name="Samsung-Gallery-private-album" alt="An option to move a picture to the private album in Samsung Gallery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wu66RbscoKDJfxkq58q6kR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feature blends the security you need with the convenience you’ve been missing, and it looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">"Locked Folder" trick</a> Google Photos users have enjoyed for a while. Instead of migrating files to a completely different partition of your phone, you simply open an image or video, tap the "More" menu, and hit "Move to private album." You can even select multiple items and toss them in at once.</p><p>To view these hidden files, you just head to the Gallery’s menu and tap "Private Album." It is protected by your fingerprint or screen lock, so your secrets stay safe even if you hand your unlocked phone to a friend to swipe through vacation pics. Plus, Samsung disables screenshots inside the album.</p><p>But keep in mind, this is still a beta feature and is pretty basic for now. For example, you can only sort files by date and can’t rearrange them. The options are limited too — you can share, delete, or move files back to the main gallery, but that’s about it.</p><p>Since this is currently spotted in the One UI 8.5 beta, you will likely need to wait for the official rollout to see it on your device. Either way, this is the feature Samsung Gallery needed to truly compete with Google Photos on usability.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If anything, it's an achievement that devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> managed to be just 8.3mm even with a massive 7,500mAh battery.</p><p>Infinix is doing its part with the Hot 60 Pro+; the phone isn't new, having made its debut in August, but it stands out for being an entry-level phone with a thickness of just 6mm. Of course, that nets it the moniker of the thinnest budget phone, and it isn't like the device is hobbled with a small battery — it still gets a 5,160mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5055px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8HnbeCUxGQ8iGaB53Umw3f" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8HnbeCUxGQ8iGaB53Umw3f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5055" height="2847" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If anything, Infinix did a great job with the design of the Hot 60 Pro+. The phone gets a polycarbonate mid-frame and a fiberglass rear, and it's even available in eco leather. The vibrant colors and etched lines give it a decent amount of character, and I like the yellow hue of my unit — it reminds me of POCO's devices.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7JbEmW3bZAWyRZcPmtg6ue" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JbEmW3bZAWyRZcPmtg6ue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="RqV7KoxU329bKcJE7ptote" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RqV7KoxU329bKcJE7ptote.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="MFQseidN4GYLLYbcniQXqe" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFQseidN4GYLLYbcniQXqe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CDSdoqf5pe92Xo7WEPXite" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDSdoqf5pe92Xo7WEPXite.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Another way the Hot 60 Pro+ stands out is the profile; the phone has dual-curved sides, and that's just not something you see these days.

It has a 6.78-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel, and the MediaTek Helio G200 is decent. It's running ancient Cortex A76 cores, so you will see noticeable lag even in mundane tasks, and it is strictly designed for casual gaming — it doesn't handle any demanding games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="85Ddp9PfnzviyYdAzSwH4f" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85Ddp9PfnzviyYdAzSwH4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 50MP camera is strictly average as well, and I don't know when was the last time I used a phone that didn't have Wi-Fi 6 — the Hot 60 Pro+ is limited to Wi-Fi ac. Look, this thing won't win any awards, but it is a sleek phone, and it is pretty durable thanks to IP65 ingress protection. The battery life is quite good, and the panel gets bright enough in outdoor use. Considering it costs $200, the Hot 60 Pro+ is a decent enough device, with a design that rivals phones priced thrice as high.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the update adds a number of features to the new flagship lineup, including auto-themed icons and AI-powered notification summaries, it also seems to have killed support for the Pixel Stand wireless charger.</p><p>Google debuted the Pixel 10 series as the first flagship Android phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 wireless charging support</a>. Alongside native Qi2 charging, Google also launched its own lineup of Qi2 accessories called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which includes a new wireless charger and stand designed for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Naturally, Google ended support for the older Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) for the Pixel 10, considering the company needed to push its new wireless chargers and the fact that the second-gen Pixel Stand topped out at 7.5W, leading to slow charging speeds and overheating, while the new Pixelsnap chargers deliver up to 25W.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-update-quietly-breaks-pixel-stand-support-2">Pixel 10 update quietly breaks Pixel Stand support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-XL-pixelsnap-charger-02" alt="Qi2 25W charging using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, many users found that at the perfect angle, the Pixel Stand still worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. But now, users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pe68ty/pixel_stand_gen_2_not_working_after_update/">Reddit</a> are reporting that after the Android 16 QPR2 update, the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works with their devices.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/08/pixel-stand-charging-broken-for-pixel-10-10-pro-after-december-update/">PiunikaWeb</a>, users say that after the update, the Pixel Stand flashes orange and white whenever a Pixel 10 is placed on it. This wasn't the case earlier, but the charger now reportedly throws an error when attempting to charge. This means that Google has intentionally broken support for Pixel Stand in the latest Android update.</p><p>It's worth noting that the issue is limited to Pixel 10 series devices, and Google has always stated that the Pixel Stand doesn't officially support the Pixel 10. It worked until now, but the latest update seems to have introduced a change that breaks compatibility.</p><p>If you're looking for a new wireless charger, you might want to pick up one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">new Qi2 wireless chargers</a> to make sure your device charges at maximum speed without any issues.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fossil, one of the biggest Wear OS brands before Samsung, lagged a year behind when it released Wear OS 3.5 in 2023, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">abandoned smartwatches</a> entirely a few months later. It offered another year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-gen-6-watch-november-2024-update">small updates</a> before fully abandoning the brand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1189px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZakdJG7CAUoUCGnWqeHjsc" name="Mobvoi-TicNote-AI-gadget" alt="A press photo of a woman sliding a Mobvoi TicNote recorder into her shirt pocket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZakdJG7CAUoUCGnWqeHjsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1189" height="669" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, OnePlus is our favorite Wear OS alternative, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> offering impressive battery life and fast Wear OS 5 performance. But its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, is months overdue to receive its promised Wear OS 5 update.

According to the study, the earlier a kid owns a smartphone, the greater the risk they have of adverse effects on their sleep, emotional state, and health.</p><p>We had several options, ranging from ages 5-7 to age 14 and older. Somewhat surprisingly, of the hundreds of responses we received, most were from older ages. In fact, <strong>ages 14 and up</strong> was the most popular response with 53% of the votes, followed by ages 11-13 with 36% of the votes, ages 8-10 with 10% of the votes, and ages 5-7 with the remaining votes.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-WlkAve"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/WlkAve.js" async></script><p>Enjoy our content?

This would fall somewhere in the 10 to 14 age range, and is considered, to many, an important time for kids, socially. With the advent of after-school programs, social activities, and a growing need for independence as they navigate their pre-teen years, having an easier way to contact your child and keep track of their whereabouts may become a necessity for some parents.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think 13/14 is a good age for kids knowing how to act online and 16 for all other cases<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996827061319880945">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We gave our granddaughter one when she stated middle school.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1997734976037806385">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>However, some were not as open to smartphone use for younger children, especially as the cost of owning one continues to go up and phones become more expensive.

Google denies such claims.</p><p>This afternoon, Marvin posted on Google's official Ads Liaison X account, stating that, "In short, there are no ads in the Gemini app, and there are no current plans to change that." Marvin reiterates the company's work to place ads in AI Overviews, a feature that is meant to be "helpful" to users, as it should only display products "relevant" to your query. The social media post states that U.S. users have this available in AI Overviews; however, there are plans to expand this to more (English-speaking) regions.</p><p>The original story can be read below.</p><p>A recent development in the AI chatbot space reports that Google is preparing to slip even more ads into an app that Android users may lean on.</p><p>Word broke on X via a post by Walter Bloomberg (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1998077960964768244">DeItaone</a>), which states that Google is seeking to bring ads to its AI chatbot, Gemini. The social media post states that the company has "told advertisers" that it will bring ads to Gemini in 2026. What's unclear here is whether or not these ads would appear on the mobile app alongside the web app, though it's hard to imagine one without the other.</p><p>More importantly, the report doesn't state in what capacity users could see ads appear in Gemini next year.</p><p>The Gemini app is currently quite clean, offering an easy-to-use chatting space with the AI, as well as a sidebar with additional options on the left. There's a chance ads could appear within chats themselves, potentially as a footnote, or in that sidebar for more "creative" ad space. Aside from the theories, the X post adds that this report was the result of "agency buyers familiar with the conversations," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/">Ad Week</a> (paywalled), which published the exclusive.</p><p>The publication adds that, in a few calls with advertisers, Google has expressed its intent to roll out "ad placements" in Gemini next year. Supposedly, this new venture for Google for ads in Gemini is separate from what it's trying to do with AI Mode, though the details are still being hashed out.</p><h2 id="entering-another-new-era-2">Entering (another) new era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google and ads seem like familiar territory for many users, especially those targeted by their recent searches. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">announced that it would bring ads</a> to its bite-sized search results, AI Overviews, in 2024. During that time, Google said that it would only display ads if they were "relevant" to what the user had searched. If you're looking to compare cleaning products, it's likely you'll see ads for those same brands the AI compared for you.</p><p>We're entering an interesting juncture, as Google, at the time, stated that ads in AI Overviews were "helpful." This was a statement facilitated by user studies and tests where the company offered ads depending on the search and AI results. Perhaps these ads are more "helpful" or "accepted" in a web or search form, but to see them in Gemini, a chatbot and chatting space, might be a different story.</p><p>Regardless, this is seemingly the future we're staring at.</p><p>This report, highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, comes a few days after rumors claimed that OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/signs-in-chatgpts-code-suggest-android-users-are-in-for-an-influx-of-ads">was looking at rolling out ads in ChatGPT</a>. This would affect its mobile app experience, and it seems that ChatGPT could show ads based on its "memory," essentially, what it remembers about the user through their ads and frequent asks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At first glance, the proposed renderings claim that next year's stylus will look similar to Motorola's design from 2025, as well as a few of its other phones this year. The phone's rear panel hosts a square (rounded corner) camera array in the top left corner. Its corners, around its frame, remain quite soft, rounded for better in-hand comfort.</p><p>Supposedly, Motorola is interested in equipping the phone with an "eco-leather" material on its back panel, rather than glass. This material rolls over that camera housing for a seamless aesthetic.</p><p>The publication adds that the G Stylus 2026 could feature a triple camera setup, though the specifics of those lenses are unknown. When it comes to potential upgrades, the rumors allege that it could see a battery slightly over 5,000mAh. We can stay hopeful with this, but it's worth noting that the G Stylus has kept the same 5,000mAh battery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">for the past two iterations</a>. Charging strength is expected to remain the same as its 2025 iteration, much like its RAM/storage.</p><p>As far as colors go, the Moto G Stylus 2026 is allegedly keeping the same colorful back plus frame design. The leaked renders show off the phone in a supposed Lavender and black option, both of which see that same color applied to its side rails. The leak dipped into its potential power, which suggests a mid-range Qualcomm chip could get the gig.

Each device was equipped with the MediaTek 6300, a mid-range chip that offers pretty decent capabilities, good enough for daily tasks.</p><p>They'll likely struggle a little with the FPS in more intense mobile games, but they can get the job done in other areas. This is where Moto's G Stylus usually takes things up a little, at least, chip-wise. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">2025 version</a> included the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which was good at running games, but, as previously stated, mid-range chips often falter slightly with more graphically intense games.</p><p>The Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 was announced earlier this year, and Qualcomm said the chip was upgraded with an 11% faster CPU and 29% better graphics. <em>If </em>Motorola is looking at this chip for its next Stylus, maybe it'll hold its own a little better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One area where Samsung is particularly lacking is portable chargers. The brand doesn't have a first-party magnetic power bank available yet, and that makes topping up ultra-thin phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge tricky. If you recall, Apple basically marketed the new MagSafe Battery as an essential accessory for the slim iPhone Air.</p><p>That looks to be changing, as a new Samsung magnetic power bank has appeared on the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi2 database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/08/samsungs-qi2-magnet-wireless-battery-pack-leaks-fixes-a-galaxy-phone-problem/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's called the "Magnet Wireless Battery Pack," and has a certification date of Dec. 5, 2025. The power bank uses the magnetic power profile (MPP), according to the database listing, which means it features magnets for snap connection with Qi2 devices and cases.</p><p>Samsung's Magnet Wireless Power Bank supports Qi2.1, and it'll max out at 15W charging speeds as a result. It doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2 25W</a>, so it can't deliver 25W speeds to supported devices. However, this is unlikely to become an issue, as most chargers and accessories cannot sustain wireless 25W power delivery for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The Magnet Wireless Power Bank has a Samsung model number of <strong>EB-U2500</strong>, per the listing. This follows a separate leak that revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-qi2-charger-leak-suggests-a-magsafe-rival-could-finally-come-to-the-galaxy-s26" target="_blank">Samsung Qi2 magnetic charging dock </a>last week.</p><p>All together, it looks like Samsung will indeed add embedded Qi2 magnets directly inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. The current Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">require a compatible case</a> to unlock full magnetic Qi2 support.</p><h2 id="addressing-a-unique-galaxy-design-flaw-2">Addressing a unique Galaxy design flaw</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one interesting bit about the Samsung Magnet Wireless Battery Pack — the design. It mostly features a rectangular shape, from the one render available on the WPC database. However, there are clearly cutouts on the corners that curve around the Qi2 magnetic ring. This makes for an odd visual design, but it's there for a reason.</p><p>Samsung's rear camera lens arrangement can interfere with Qi2 charging accessories. While Apple and Google phones have more compact camera arrangements near the top of the devices, Samsung's single-lens arrangements protrude deeper into the body of the phone. This can prevent Qi2 chargers from sitting flush. It certainly looks like the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack is designed to address this compatibility issue once and for all.</p><p>Samsung hasn't confirmed the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack on its side of things yet. We could see it debut alongside the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, we spotted this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank"><strong>40% off discount on the Fitbit Versa 4 at Amazon</strong></a>, bringing it down to just $120.</p><p>The Versa 4 is our top pick for mid-range Fitbit options, despite Google recently pushing more of its advanced features toward the Pixel series. Regardless, the Versa 4 will still get users GPS, a 24-hour heart rate monitoring system, and a variety of exercise modes to choose from. It's also a bit smaller than most smartwatches, which makes it a worthy option for sleep monitoring when compared to the many bulkier options available.</p><p>The Versa 4 also includes access to apps like Fitbit Pay, Amazon's Alexa, Google Wallet and Maps, as well as offering daily stress management and readiness features. It also sports a long-lasting battery, 50-meter water resistance, and additional health metrics such as menstrual health tracking, guided breathing sessions, mindfulness programs, and still more. At the time of writing, this deal is available for the Black, Pink Sand, and Waterfall Blue versions of the smartwatch.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU" name="Fitbit Versa 4" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Fitbit Versa 4:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$199.95</del> <strong>$119.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Fitbit Versa 4 is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit#section-best-midrange">best mid-range Fitbit</a>, though the current $120 price tag makes it even more appealing amongst some of its competitors.

However, that only tells part of the story. Apple earned the top four spots, and four of its five best-selling smartphones were "premium" models. Meanwhile, Samsung didn't have a single premium handset on the top charts, instead earning its five places on the best-selling list with midrange Galaxy A models.</p><p>The best-selling smartphone in Q3 2025 was the base-model iPhone 16, by a wide margin. It had a 4% volume share, and this helped the iPhone 16 keep its first-place spot for the third consecutive quarter. Surprisingly, the top four spots were held by the iPhone 16 series — the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and iPhone 16e, in that order — which usually experiences a seasonal sales decline before new models come out.</p><p>Another surprise was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, which earned the 10th-place spot despite going on sale at the tail end of the Q3 2025 tracking period. This suggests there is strong demand for the iPhone 17 series, and specifically, the most-expensive iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.05%;"><img id="jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh" name="Q3-2025-Counterpoint-Research-Sales" alt="The Counterpoint Research smartphone sales data for Q3 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2404" height="1083" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint Research)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's bread and butter in Q3 2025 was the midrange market. It held the fifth-place through ninth-place spots with its latest Galaxy A-series phones. The best-seller of the bunch was the Galaxy A16 5G, followed by the Galaxy A06, Galaxy A36, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56</a>, and Galaxy A16 4G. Samsung didn't have a single premium smartphone on the list. Last year, Samsung had the base-model Galaxy S24 on the Q3 2024 best-sellers list.</p><p>Counterpoint Research thinks Samsung's addition of AI features to the Galaxy A series via "Awesome Intelligence" could be driving sales.</p><p>"The mid-price segment’s presence in the top-10 best-selling smartphones is expected to remain strong, driven by the growing integration of GenAI features," the report explains. "These advancements make the segment more competitive, deliver greater value to consumers, and further bridge the user experience with flagship models."</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 could be experiencing an early seasonal decline as buyers look ahead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>. However, its absence from the list is a big deal for Samsung. With only the Galaxy A-series appearing on the best-sellers list, Samsung doesn't have a single phone with a wholesale price of over $600 here.</p><p>Additionally, 5G phones covered all of the top five spots for the first time, with Counterpoint Research calling the technology "a key consumer preference across regions" as of Q3 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During the show, Google offered a glimpse into the progress it has made with its Android XR smartglasses, and also announced some new capabilities coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Samsung's Galaxy XR</a> headset starting today(Dec. 8).</p><p>Starting off with Galaxy XR's new tricks, which Google says are designed to "help you fully experience the spatial capabilities of Android XR and allow you to fit your headset naturally into the things you do every day."</p><p>With the Galaxy XR's new "PC Connect" ability, users will be able to expand their workspace beyond the desktop to the headset, then pull in their desktop or a window from their computer and place it side-by-side with native apps from Google Play. This feature is super cool for when you need a multi-screen view to get things done, or if you'd like a more spatial view of the game you've been playing on the PC.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9xPC_FoaG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Next up, Google is introducing "Travel mode," which is designed to transform any small area, such as a flight cabin, into an immersive workspace or personal home theater when you're stuck in the same space for several hours, allowing you to stay connected while on the go.</p><p>Speaking of work, the tech giant is also bringing "Likeness," a feature that will create a" realistic digital representation of your face that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time." This means that even though you're wearing the Galaxy XR headset, others will be able to see your reactions and expressions in real-time, making interactions feel more natural.</p><p>All of these features for the Galaxy XR Headset are currently in the Beta phase, and users can head to the Help center to get more information on how to try these tricks out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="project-aura-by-xreal-2">Project Aura by XReal</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh" name="Aura_3_TAS_XR_ Nov 06 2025_110 (1)" alt="Google shows off Project Aura XReal glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5871" height="3914" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is giving us the first look at Project Aura from XREAL, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. These glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.  For instance, giving you a "floating recipe video while you cook or seeing step-by-step visual guides anchored to an appliance you are fixing," all this without blocking off your surroundings. Ofcourse, all with the help of Gemini.</p><p>That said, these XReal smartglasses come wired and are synced to a phone-sized device with a trackpad that handles the computing, according to Android Central's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">who was able to demo these glasses</a>. Google states that the glasses are set to launch sometime next year.</p><p>However, it is important to note that these XReal prototypes aren't the design that Samsung will use; Hicks says it'll be using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">Warby Parker and Gentle Monster </a>designs, which will be compatible with both Android and iOS, and that they will be wireless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, in a press release to Android Central, Google says it is currently working on two pairs of glasses. One being the screen-free AI glasses, which have in-built speakers, microphones, and cameras to allow you to talk to Gemini, take photos, and get help. The second, display AI glasses, which add a small screen to show private, helpful information when you need it, such as navigation or translation. The former is set to arrive next year.</p><p>Google is also releasing Developer Preview 3, giving developers to build new experiences for AI glasses and wired XR glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>
