                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Wireless audio is great — the convenience is top-notch, and it's freeing to be able to do <em>anything</em> without snagging a cable. The problem is, wireless audio is also expensive. If you're on a tight budget, it's almost always smarter to pick up a great pair of wired earbuds or in-ear monitors (IEMs) rather than waste money on a cheap pair of truly wireless earbuds.</p><p>If you want to upgrade your audio during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a>, you can do so while spending less than $20 by picking up one of these in-ear monitors. You'll get excellent sound quality and a detachable cable on all three of my picks, and two of them have optional microphones. I love Prime Day deals that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sony-wf-1000xm5-under-usd200-prime-day-limited-time">cut the prices of the best wireless earbuds</a>, but it's still hard to beat good old-fashioned wired earbuds.</p><p>Whether you need wired headphones for traveling, gaming, or just streaming music on your phone, these are the Prime Day deals you NEED to see before they run out.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1124689220047358064-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow!

The fit is excellent, with a tangle-free cable that wraps around your ears for comfort and security. Best of all, the 10mm dynamic driver inside the ZSN Pro X earbuds produce a ridiculous amount of bass for something of their size.</p><p>You can grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">microphone-free version for just $19.19, </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHTF69/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">get the microphone version for only 80 cents more.</a></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a91d7db4-597e-4046-99cf-a79fe96e70d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension48="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:679px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.83%;"><img id="YdDYWZT58L3dFJB8YNBYHG" name="KZ ZSN Pro X iem" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YdDYWZT58L3dFJB8YNBYHG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="679" height="705" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>KZ ZSN Pro X: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monitors-Headphones-Fidelity-Detachable-Tangle-Free/dp/B08DNHYQTL/?th=1" data-dimension112="a91d7db4-597e-4046-99cf-a79fe96e70d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension48="KZ ZSN Pro X: $23.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$23.99</del> <strong>$19.19 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>KZ's ZSN Pro X set the bar for cheap, quality audio.

These are a lot smaller and lighter due to their plastic construction, but you still get a standout 10mm driver. You also have a sleek design with neat gold accents and a replaceable cable. I love seeing that feature on a pair of IEMs, because if the cable wears out, you can swap one in for dirt cheap.</p><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Moondrop-CHU-II-Performance-Interchangeable/dp/B0CB8HHS8V/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">only $18 on Prime Day</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Moondrop-CHU-II-Performance-Interchangeable/dp/B0CB8HHS8V/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"> </a>I might buy a pair of these myself, and I have way too many pairs of headphones and earbuds already.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="58b88b7b-d81e-4b7f-871d-4f3330f4a5c9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Moondrop CHU II: $22.99" data-dimension48="Moondrop CHU II: $22.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Moondrop-CHU-II-Performance-Interchangeable/dp/B0CB8HHS8V/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fozEfHTwWupwGDpcPZzK4D" name="Moondrop-CHU-II" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fozEfHTwWupwGDpcPZzK4D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Moondrop CHU II: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moondrop-CHU-II-Performance-Interchangeable/dp/B0CB8HHS8V/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="58b88b7b-d81e-4b7f-871d-4f3330f4a5c9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Moondrop CHU II: $22.99" data-dimension48="Moondrop CHU II: $22.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$22.99</del> <strong>$18.39 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Moondrop's CHU II are a cheaper and more compact pair of in-ear monitors that still manage to feature a high-quality, detachable cable.

They're great for throwing in a bag as a backup plan in case you forget your primary audio gear at home. If you grab a microphone-equipped version, you can take Google Meet or Zoom calls on the go without relying on your phone or laptop's awful mic quality.</p><p>I also like wired earbuds because they're cheap — you can be a bit reckless with them, not worrying about damaging gear worth hundreds of dollars. Sometimes I'll take these on a run or hike, or while traveling, because it won't be the end of the world if they get lost or damaged. All three of these options have detachable cables, which is great for repairability.</p><p>After you've picked up a pair of wired IEMs, don't forget to buy a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. I wish the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> still had a headphone jack, but that's a story for another day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF" name="UGreen-USBC-Audio-Adapter" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$9.99</del> <strong>$7.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>This tiny and cheap adapter will turn your device's USB-C port into a 3.5mm port for easy, wired connection to any of the earbuds on this list. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7144284460815907008-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day ENDS tomorrow: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1125421941494451889-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2331615209002580149-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9655087999259234463-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3558196267450012492-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

And it's even worse when you combine the two, such is the case with a lot of these newer retro gaming handhelds. Since there are so many to choose from, and Prime Day 2025 in full swing, I figured it'd be a good time to share five of my current favorites.</p><p>The great thing about having so many options is that there are a bunch of different designs to choose from. Especially since we've been seeing a resurgence in clamshell handhelds since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG35XXSP-Handheld-3-5-inch-Simulators-Protector/dp/B0F2T4JFQ5/">RG35XXSP</a> last year. Now, we have options like the RG34XXSP, which includes dual joysticks, an excellent hinge, and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG34XXSP-Foldable-Handheld-Joystick-Bluetooth/dp/B0F6KCMWB2"><strong>on sale for 15% off</strong></a> on Prime Day.</p><p>But that's not the only option, as we have the classic Miyoo Mini Plus, which has been around for the past few years and can be had for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Console-Classic-Consoles-Wireless-Handheld/dp/B0DC6QHQ3Y/"><strong>under $50</strong></a>. Then there's the TrimUI Brick, which is more powerful than the Miyoo Mini Plus and has one of the best screens I've ever used on a retro handheld. Oh, and it's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Console-Multiple-Classic-Emulators-System-Purple/dp/B0F3D7GMGQ"><strong>on sale for 10% off</strong></a> over at Amazon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9067931038562183873-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><em><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow night!

The camera tech is also largely unchanged from the Galaxy S24, and folks with PWM sensitivity may have an issue with the S25&apos;s AMOLED display.

SBC, AAC, LDAC, and LC3 are all available on the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. Specifically, LDAC is a proprietary Sony codec that can handle 24-bit/96kHz sample rates at a bitrate of up to 990kbps.

But that front clip-on and cable tether will stand out, like a strip of tape on a movie nerd's broken glasses, so it's best suited for (say) a long nature walk where you don't care as much about style.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to extend your Ray-Ban Meta battery life, don't mind carrying the charging case around with you, and have a darker pair on which the cable won't stand out too much.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You'd rather buy the version that drains your phone battery, or you'd rather let your glasses die then make them look too dorky with a cable attached.</p><p>I obviously can't tell you if this mod will work without having tried it myself, nor if the cable is long enough to keep the charging case in your pocket as you walk. But I appreciate this unique and clever approach to solving the battery problem with my glasses, and I'm hopeful it'll solve my problems.</p><p>Eventually, I'm going to look into Meta Oakley glasses, which have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">doubled battery life over the Ray-Ban Metas</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">leaked 3rd-generation Ray-Ban Metas</a> that are supposed to have "significantly longer battery life" than my current pair.

According to this executive, the company is looking at launching its next tablets, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, "shortly." The unnamed source didn't give specifics; however, they state the tablets will see a launch timeframe close to Samsung's "traditional cadence."</p><p>The publication's source stating the launch adheres to Samsung's "traditional" cadence seems a little strange. It sounds like they're referring to its launch timeframe but, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">other than the Galaxy Tab S10</a>, its recent tablets have launched earlier in the year.</p><p>The last series debuted in September (Sept. 26 to be specific), which was a one month shift from the Galaxy Tab S9 and seven month difference for the S8 series. The latter debuted in February 2022, while the former appeared in August 2023.</p><p>The publication speculates we should see the Tab S11 in September again this year, which sounds more plausible, unless Samsung stuns us with an August reveal.</p><h2 id="the-tab-s11-could-switch-up-the-series-again-2">The Tab S11 could switch up the series (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 rumor trail goes back a few months, but its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">leak claims the Ultra model</a> will debut with a powered-up chip. The Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted running through Geekbench for its performance test; however, it was listed with a MediaTek chip: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC</a>. This is MediaTek's refreshed response to Qualcomm's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Strangely, reports said the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" despite rocking this flagship chip. The SoC features a strong GPU that helps facilitate "PC-like" graphical performance on mobile devices.</p><p>Also, with the Tab S11 series (hopefully) coming up, rumors have stated Samsung is switching things up by returning the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">and dropping the Plus</a>. We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already looking around</a> for the base Galaxy Tab S10 after Samsung only gave us a Plus and Ultra. Now, we're just confused. Regardless, Tab S11 is rumored to feature a 8,160mAh battery, while the Ultra could jump to  ~11,374mAh this year.</p><p>Earlier rumors suggested Samsung would save the Tab S11 series for a launch after Unpacked, meaning sometime in the fall. So, perhaps its debut will mirror the Tab S10 after all.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16126339?hl=en&ref_topic=16079905&sjid=14845917384801852633-NA&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">support page</a>,  Google says users can then add a text description into the box, informing the AI of <em>how </em>they want the video to be generated.</p><p>The post states users should be as descriptive as possible, detailing the scene and "any audio instructions" to Gemini. After finishing, users should navigate beneath the text box to <strong>More > Veo > Submit.</strong></p><p>These clips won't be full-length YouTube-esque videos, mind you. Gemini will only generate video clips that are eight seconds long. Additionally, it may take Gemini a minute or two before you receive your clip.</p><p>There are some limitations here, such as the number of videos subscribers can create.</p><h2 id="gemini-veo-3-2">Gemini & Veo 3</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqaKDhwTW1Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>After completing, Google says users can download Gemini's generated video and share it with others. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers "globally" can expect the feature to start appearing today (July 10) in Gemini. What's more, the post says users can expect these same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">photo-to-video capabilities in Flow</a>, too.</p><p>Google also highlights its commitment to safety with its AI tools, stating that it's taken "significant steps" to ensure an "appropriate experience."</p><p>What's funny about this "new" feature rolling out in Gemini today is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-to-debut-google-cloud-powered-ai-image-to-video-feature">we've seen before</a>. In May, Google launched five second clip generation capabilities using its Google Cloud AI-powered software for the Honor 400 series. The feature works the same way as what you'll find in Gemini, turning regular photos into animated clips. What key difference was the launch on Honor's 400 series came with the Veo 2 model, and later required a Google subscription for continued use.</p><p>Veo 3 was shining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-youtube-shorts-integration-creator-creativity-report">highlight during I/O 2025</a>, as Google detailed its audio capabilities and lifelike video strength. As Gemini picks up its prowess for breathing animation into photos, YouTube was also interested in bringing Veo 3 into the fold for Shorts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, I'm not really a fan of using a mouse and keyboard, as a good controller goes a long way. For the better part of the past year, there's been one controller on my desk, and it's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZhttps://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>$20 off</strong></a><strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>for Prime Day</strong></a>.</p><p>Obviously, we're not strangers to GameSir, but until I got the Super Nova, I never really considered them for anything other than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>. At the time, I was using my Xbox Elite Series 2 Core, but the rubber grips had started to wear off, and something was going on with the left joystick.</p><p>But I've always been a sucker for Xbox controllers, so I figured I would end up just buying another one to replace it. Almost a year later, and that has not happened, with the Super Nova still being docked right on my desk.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1316556028087985621-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE: See the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4" name="gamesir-super-nova-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>GameSir Super Nova:</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCLD9PLY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1329189071882698668-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension25=""> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>$59.99</del> <strong>$39.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>There are a lot of controllers out there, even from GameSir itself, but the Super Nova remains my favorite of the bunch.

It probably won't take long to realize why I might like this, since it's basically the same design as Microsoft's controller, down to the rubberized grips.</p><p>The controls are all nice and responsive, and I don't even feel the need to install GameSir's Nexus app on my PC. Part of that is because I'm pretty basic and don't really use things like the paddle controls on the back. What I do use, however, are the trigger switches. This shortens the travel distance before the input is recognized, and is an absolute necessity when I'm playing Call of Duty.</p><p>And on top of all of that, I never have to worry about plugging in or replacing batteries, as the Super Nova comes with a charging dock. So when I'm done playing, I just put it back on the dock until the next gaming session rolls around.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-27">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9764014712696558246-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6188859583910098122-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3325142520077420800-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4166824583098299148-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1424464865141903563-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company highlights this channel as an "experimental new option for developers" interested in getting early glimpses at in-development Android features and APIs. This first release is rolling out for Pixel owners ranging from the Pixel 6 series up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">to the Pixel 9</a>, including the Pixel Fold and Tablet.</p><p>Developers with an eligible Pixel phone can begin downloading the ZP11.250606.010.A1  build to test the latest Android version contents.</p><p>However, even though this is for developers, Google stresses that these early Android API builds are deep in their testing era. Builds, such as the first one via the Canary Release Channel today, "may contain bugs or issues that could affect your device's normal operations." These builds aren't "suitable for everyday use," so developers might want to have another device on standby as their daily driver.</p><p>In a separate newsletter, obtained by Android Central's News Editor, Nandika Ravi, developers can help "build for new foldables and wearables." The letter highlights the ability to help build new adaptive apps for phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">like the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7</a> for more "immersive experiences" that "adaptively" respond to these unique devices. Moreover, developers can also get their hands on the tools required to build new, refreshing features in Wear OS 6.</p><h2 id="android-s-soaring-with-canary-2">Android's soaring with Canary</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1lwjvwh/introducing_the_android_canary_release_channel">Introducing the Android Canary Release Channel!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The Reddit post states developers can flash the latest Canary build onto their Android device or they can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/canary#on_emulatoroper.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds">Android Emulator</a> via Android Studio. Once it's installed, your device becomes eligible for future Canary patches and updates. These are expected to occur "once a month." Be warned: if you're looking to leave the Android Canary channel, your device will have to undergo a full data wipe.</p><p>If the name "Canary" sounds familiar, it's because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Google's Chrome Canary</a> test environment for users and developers. Anyone can download Chrome Canary to try out the latest advancements, features, and more headed for Chrome before anyone else (using Stable) see it. Google sees it as a way to squash terrible bugs <em>before </em>they become an issue.</p><p>One key difference is that Chrome Canary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-release-channels">is updated far more frequently</a> than Google's plans for Android Canary. According to its dev doc, Chrome Canary is updated once a day and, at times, multiple times a day. Of course, some of these more frequent updates in a single day is because Canary "can (and does) break," per Google.</p><p>The company's been busy testing a wide range of Chrome features, ranging from AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-password-data-breach-help-spotted">protect users from data breaches</a> to better enhancements from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">phishing attempts/scams</a>.</p><p>It's also been a little over two weeks since Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-2-1-starts-rolling-out-to-pixels-with-some-bug-fixes">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2.1</a> to Pixel testers. The minor patch was filled with a few fixes that were plaguing devices following the more substantial 2.0 update. Users on Reddit are awaiting the 3.0 update, as are we.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you’ve got a good memory, this isn’t totally out of the blue: back in 2022, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-sets-the-new-standard-with-four-generations-of-os-upgrades-to-ensure-the-most-up-to-date-and-more-secure-galaxy-experience" target="_blank">promised</a> up to four years of One UI Watch and Wear OS updates for the Watch 4 lineup.</p><p>However, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-beta-3-rolls-out-for-galaxy-s25-and-galaxy-watches-see-their-first-beta">Samsung dropped the One UI 8 Watch beta</a>, it kind of looked like the Galaxy Watch 4 was being quietly pushed aside.

After some confusion and plenty of speculation online, the company has now officially confirmed that the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup is getting the same fresh coat of software paint that's rolling out to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">newer Galaxy Watches</a>.</p><p>This marks the last major update for these four-year-old watches, which originally rolled out with Wear OS 3 and One UI Watch 3 out of the box.</p><p>One UI 8 Watch packs in a bunch of upgrades you’d think were just for the newer model, like better health tracking, deeper sleep data, and Galaxy AI tricks that Samsung won’t stop talking about.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 series is powered by the 4nm Exynos W920 with just two Cortex-A55 cores, so it’s anyone’s guess how well One UI 8 Watch will actually run on it. It's highly probable that some of the fancier, newer features destined for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> series might not make it to the older hardware.</p><p>Still, it’s a nice move for anyone sticking with their Galaxy Watch 4. Instead of being left behind, the watch is getting a refresh and a few upgrades to keep things feeling new again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's what you need these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J"><strong>$16 controller grips</strong></a>, on sale until the end of Prime Day on July 11, 2025.</p><p>The wrist straps included with the controllers will keep them from flying across the room, but these grip straps keep them from falling off your hand at all in the first place. Not only that, but the adjustable wrist strap fits all hand sizes — from kids to adults — and helps balance the controllers better in your hands.</p><p>That makes them <em>far</em> more comfortable for long play sessions and even helps you better throw objects while playing in VR. When you can actually let go of the controllers and not worry about them ending up in the drywall, you gain serious confidence and skill that'll get you to the top of those leaderboards.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3s-prime-day-deal-2025" target="_blank"><strong>The best Meta Quest 3S sale we've ever seen is live during Prime Day</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="08e8f7b8-d771-4dfd-a15a-8c2ae02fce8f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension48="AMVR controller grips:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qHaL56gPUWPTg2sgbK4H6" name="amvr-meta-quest-3-controller-handles.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qHaL56gPUWPTg2sgbK4H6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AMVR controller grips:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J" data-dimension112="08e8f7b8-d771-4dfd-a15a-8c2ae02fce8f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension48="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension25=""><strong> </strong><del>$23.99</del><strong> $15.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>These minimalist grips fit on Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S controllers, replacing the battery door with a grippy texture and an adjustable hand strap that keeps your controllers in your hands, even when you completely let go.

Plus, since the straps just replace the battery door, it's dead simple to swap out the batteries when they get low. Just pop the door out like usual and snap it back in when you're done!</p><p>But not everyone likes the feel of the smooth plastic of the Meta Quest Touch controllers. That's why Kiwi Design's choice of grips is a great choice. They're a bit more expensive than the minimalist AMVR strap, but the soft-touch silicone material covers your entire Quest controller (with cutouts for the tracking LEDs), preventing hand sweat and adding extra grip in the process.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.07%;"><img id="vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS" name="meta-quest-3s-kiwi-design-g4-pro-controller-grips-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1411" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$34.99</del><strong> $27.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Kiwi Design's upgraded controller grips envelop your controllers in a comfy silicone bumper, preventing slippage and sweat. The new cloth hand strap is far more comfortable than the pleather strap from the old design, and the handy battery door makes it simple to swap out those batteries instead of taking the entire grip off. Plus, this <strong>$7 discount</strong> makes them far less painful to invest in during the Prime Day sale.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Kiwi Design notably improved this design over the original by swapping out the rigid pleather straps with soft, cloth straps that stretch with your hands. They're so much more comfortable, you have to wonder why this material wasn't used the first time around!</p><p>The handy battery door opens up when you want and makes it simple to swap out batteries, too, so you don't need to remove the whole grip just to charge. Kiwi Design was also careful not to cover any of the tracking LEDs, including the hidden one on the inside bottom of the controller itself, so these don't negatively affect tracking.</p><p>But folks with bigger hands should choose Kiwi Design's other controller grips for maximum comfort.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e9466fec-0388-4653-8412-44db75e67e54" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design G4 Max controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design G4 Max controller grips: $34.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DK4LG7T4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1427px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.89%;"><img id="wg5WDxGvLonoPqYeQvorhQ" name="kiwi-design-g4-max-meta-quest-3-grips" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wg5WDxGvLonoPqYeQvorhQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1427" height="1454" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Kiwi Design G4 Max controller grips: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DK4LG7T4/" data-dimension112="e9466fec-0388-4653-8412-44db75e67e54" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design G4 Max controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design G4 Max controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$34.99</del><strong> $27.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Love the Meta Quest controller design, but don't like how short the handles are?

During a press interview with Roh, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says">The Korea Times</a> highlighted a part of the discussions where the long-rumored "Galaxy G Fold" was brought up. According to Roh, the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year."</p><p>Roh spoke about those Galaxy G Fold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet.</p><p>With this, we can probably expect the phone sometime between now (July) and December. However, Roh's statement might pit the tri-fold closer to a year-end release. The publication cites Roh's estimation in saying the phone might launch "at the end of this year."</p><p>Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't yield any other specifications or neat features about the tri-fold. We'll have to wait a little while longer, but there should be some official Samsung teasers when we get close.</p><h2 id="needs-a-little-longer-2">Needs a little longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During Galaxy Unpacked in January, Samsung teased what consumers can expect from it following the Galaxy S25 series launch. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">in its "roadmap,"</a> there was a unique device: a tri-fold. While a surprise, Samsung has shown off its tri-fold device prototypes a few times, especially during the CES 2025 event. The company opted to focus more on its Android XR device, instead, perhaps hinting that the phone wasn't anywhere near completion.</p><p>Shortly after, in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">rumors started coming out</a>, stating Samsung was looking at naming the phone the Galaxy G Fold. There's speculation that a new "display and film" could be found on the device's alleged 10-inch display. And it seems it might not top Huawei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a> level of thinness.</p><p>More importantly, early rumors claimed Samsung could debut the device anywhere between late 2025 and early 2026. With Roh's recent comments, perhaps it's the former we should keep our eyes on.</p><p>Anyway, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">Unpacked event yesterday</a> (July 9) brought us the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Flip 7 FE, Fold 7, and its latest Galaxy Watch 8 series. The Flip 7 has been upgraded with a more immersive edge-to-edge 4-inch display, while the Fold 7 slims down quite a bit after ditching the S Pen. Even the base Galaxy Watch 8 became a bit thinner, as Samsung packed loads of new health and sleep-focused features into the series.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You don't need to spend more than $20 to get the highest quality screen protection for your foldable's internal and external displays.</p><p>There are a few names that keep popping up time and time again when it comes to screen protector brands. IMBZBK and Milomdoi in particular always deliver, both in terms of quality and value. The three-pack from IMBZBK is the most comprehensive kit available for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Getting three sets of three items along with two frames for under $20 is a magnificent bargain. Both easy-install frames enable perfect at-home installation. The lens protectors are an added bonus.</p><p>If you're not comfortable replacing the internal screen protector off of the folding screen, you don't need to step out of your comfort zone. Simply get a cover display protector alone, which will be more cost-effective too. Spigen's upgraded GlastR EZ Fit Pro for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a good option. It comes with a frame that also acts as a dust-removing tool, simplifying the installation process. This kit includes two pieces for about $17, but if you want a cheaper alternative, consider the three-pack from Mr.Shield that only costs $7. There's no assistive frame or tool included, however, so take that into consideration before going forward with your purchase.</p><p>After grabbing a solid screen protection kit, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> for advanced impact absorption.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the naming scheme, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic doesn't really come in a dark color like black, charcoal, or graphite. If that's a deal breaker, perhaps you'll be happier with the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 in Graphite</a> instead — sans rotating bezel, though.</p><p>Don't knock the Black variant of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic until you've seen it up close and personal. I know many people only buy black tech. In fact, my husband is one such individual. However, variety is the spice of life. So spice things up with this silver-and-black combo for once! It looks really cool and matches well with various styles and materials of watch bands.</p><p>If the non-monochrome look bothers you, then the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in White will fit your tastes. This option is silver throughout and comes with a bright white band.</p><p>I do have a bone to pick with Samsung over the limited case colors. My favorite hue for wearables is usually gold, rose gold, or champagne gold. This is because it's much easier to match such shades with accessories and jewelry. It's a missed opportunity on Samsung's part to skip a warmer colorway for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're stuck with these options for this generation, so there's not much to do but complain. Hopefully, Samsung will heed our grievances with its next smartwatch lineup. If not, then people like me will probably stick with the Google Pixel Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, if you were hoping to waltz into a Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile store and add it to your existing plan with convenient financing, you're out of luck.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/you-cant-buy-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-from-carriers-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">U.S. carriers</a> have collectively decided to give the Z Flip 7 FE a wide berth.</p><p>Right now, your choices are slim. You can grab the unlocked model straight from Samsung’s online store or try your luck at places like Best Buy or Amazon. Either way, you're looking at paying full price or hopping on Samsung’s payment plan, neither of which quite hits like those sweet carrier promos.</p><h2 id="some-underdogs-step-up-2">Some underdogs step up</h2><p>Now, before you completely despair, there are a couple of small-time players who are actually offering the device. Boost Mobile and Xfinity Mobile are apparently offering the Z Flip 7 FE for free with certain postpaid plans, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/z-flip-7-fe-carrier-3576231/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>So, if you've been looking for an excuse to switch carriers, Samsung might have just given you one, albeit for a phone that the big players are apparently side-eyeing.</p><p>It’s not like Samsung didn’t try to give the FE some shine. It comes with all the expected trimmings of the Flip series, minus a few high-end frills to keep the price down. That makes it a sweet deal for anyone curious about foldables but not ready to drop flagship cash.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-the-cold-shoulder-2">Why the cold shoulder?</h2><p>There’s no official explanation yet, which just fuels the confusion. Maybe Samsung didn’t want to cannibalize its flagship foldables. Maybe carriers weren’t thrilled with the specs-to-price ratio. Or maybe the logistics didn’t pan out in time for launch.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that if you want the Z Flip 7 FE in the U.S., you’ll need to skip the carrier stores and go straight to the source.</p><p>On the bright side, unlocked buyers won’t have to deal with bloatware or the usual maze of carrier-specific delays when it comes to updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3219eac3-88d6-43d9-9891-128ad440b605">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is definitely a step-up from its predecessor, especially if you've been eyeing the competition with a bit of envy.

The machine-translated description box says the seller is offering the motherboard of the phone in question, which looks similar to what we've seen in past leaks. The alleged Pixel 10 still sports those rounded corners and flat edges, just like Google's past-gen.</p><p>The back, which furthers its prototype nature, displays the "G" logo and a horizontal camera bump with an extra lens. The photo of the motherboard features a bolded "G5," which likely indicates the phone's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC.</p><p>There appear to be three lenses inside the Pixel 10's camera island and its LED flash. The Chinese seller states this device is in its EVT stage, which the publication notes indicates the "final stage" before mass production for the market. However, 9to5 picked up on an oddity, which is the phone's fastboot mode screen that displays DVT (Design Validation Test) instead of the seller's alleged EVT stage.</p><h2 id="an-earlier-pixel-10-2">An Earlier Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:781px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.90%;"><img id="PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL" name="google-pixel-10-chinese-auction-site-leak" alt="An alleged Pixel 10 in black on sale on a Chinese auction website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="781" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GooFish)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trail of Pixel 10 leaks about its camera upgrade started in March, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a batch of renders</a> showcased it with three, not two. Aside from the seemingly identical design to the Pixel 9, there was speculation that this third lens would bring the base model closer to its Pro and Pro XL siblings.

Still, we've always called these phones flagship killers, as they feature a really nice balance of affordability and overall performance, and this price point makes the phone even more appealing.

Do you pick from only what's in your budget, or do you look for specific features that work best for you? I've found that RayNeo Air 3S is a fantastic pair of smart glasses with an ultra-comfortable display and a price tag that doesn't sting, especially with this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4"> <strong>$44 off</strong> <strong>Prime Day deal</strong></a>.</p><p>We already named RayNeo Air 3S the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best value smart glasses</a> at its regular price of $269, but this Prime Day deal brings it down to an unheard of $225, making them <em>the</em> most affordable pair of 2025 smart display glasses you'll find anywhere. I take a pair of smart glasses on every work trip, and I've been finding myself using RayNeo Air 3S most often because of the comfortable display with 3840Hz PWM dimming and hardware-level blue light blocking.</p><p>Like other smart display glasses, you'll plug the RayNeo Air 3S into basically any computer, console, smartphone, or tablet with a USB-C port and be presented with a giant projected virtual screen that only you can see. This one is a 1080p display, so it looks as crisp as a TV hanging on your wall and helps eliminate neck pain caused by looking down at a laptop or handheld gaming system for too long.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.41%;"><img id="PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL" name="RayNeo Air 3S" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>RayNeo Air 3S 😎</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$"><del>$269</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank"><strong>$225 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"With the Air 3S, RayNeo crafted what may possibly be the best budget XR glasses.

RayNeo added useful eye protection features, and the glasses connect easily to your phone, tablet, Windows and macOS machine as well as handheld gaming console. The design isn't the most comfortable around, and the glasses let in ambient light, but if you're curious about what XR glasses have to deliver, you should get your hands on these." — Harish Jonnalagadda for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you use a lot of portable devices. Whether it's around the house or while traveling, these devices can hurt your neck, but a pair of smart glasses like RayNeo Air 3S put the screen right in front of your face, so you can relax and give your neck a break without cutting out any of the fun or productivity.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a high-end pair of smart display glasses. Brands like Xreal and Viture offer better specs and more premium features, but are more expensive and often weigh more.</p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/rayneo-air-3s-ar-xr-smart-glasses-with-201-micro-oled-dark-grey/6626541.p?skuId=6626541">$225 at Best Buy</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.rayneo.com/products/rayneo-air-3s-xr-glasses">$225 at RayNeo</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses with myopia adjustments - </strong><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>RayNeo Air 3S comfortable display is powered by a pair of HueView 120Hz micro-OLED displays, giving each eye a 1080p display. Unlike most smart glasses, these use 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage brightness, ensuring comfort for the vast majority of people. For reference, your Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel phone uses 240Hz or 480Hz PWM dimming. The higher that number goes, the more comfortable it is for your eyes long-term.</p><p>These glasses use a classic "birdbath-style" lens to reflect the micro-OLED display in the glasses toward your eyes. Think of them as tiny mirrors hanging just inside the glasses' frame. Because of the way the optics work, your eyes perceive this display as a huge TV projected a few feet away.</p><p>Folks who need prescription glasses can order a custom pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://honsvr.com/product/custom-rayneo-air-2s-prescription-lenses-by-honsvr/">through HonsVR for $50</a>. I use these inserts in my smart glasses to ensure I don't have any eye strain, and they're super easy to install since they just clip into the dedicated slot between the nose pads.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch 2 gamer, you should also check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">this Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> to play your Switch 2 on the go with these OLED glasses. Steam Deck folks or anyone wanting to use their glasses <em>while</em> charging their phone or laptop should pick up one of these little dongles, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Guermok-Glasses-Converter-Portable-Monitors/dp/B0F3XC8LS3/"><strong>on sale for $19 on Prime Day</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="why-choose-another-pair-2">Why choose another pair?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wyf8hXZNXNFraTzUXUqSJS" name="xreal-one-wearing-angle" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One smart glasses to show off the fit and size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wyf8hXZNXNFraTzUXUqSJS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I said earlier, the choices in the smart glasses world are seemingly endless, but I'll narrow this down to two alternatives you might want to consider. You can get Viture Pro smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>on sale for $349</strong></a> for Prime Day, which will give you a sharper, brighter display with lenses that can dim themselves when the environment around you gets bright.</p><p>RayNeo Air 3S doesn't offer any kind of light blocking, so they can be sometimes difficult to see if you're using them outside or in a super bright room. If you're just using them in an airport, on a plane, or in our own home, you don't really need this feature. Still, Viture glasses have full support for Viture's extensive system of accessories and add-ons, which is a great reason to pick Viture over other companies.</p><p>Viture also offers myopia adjustment diopter wheels independently for each eye, allowing nearsighted users to adjust for clarity without having to buy a separate set of prescription lenses. That alone cuts $50 off the price if you need glasses, making these a great value so long as your prescription isn't greater than -5.00.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ" name="viture-pro-ecosystem-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Viture Pro smart glasses offer an extra-crisp 1080p visuals, 1000 nits of brightness, built-in myopia adjustment diopters up to -5.00, and full support for Viture's extensive range of add-ons and accessories, now on sale for <strong>$150 off </strong>during Prime Day.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The king of smart glasses right now are Xreal One, which are on sale for the first time since their launch earlier this year.

The arms adjust between three preset angles, and Xreal's frames are thinner and shaped in a way that doesn't fatigue my ears as much as the RayNeo's that are on sale. Xreal also offers full 3DoF tracking out of the box, which means that screen in front of your face isn't pinned to your nose.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2bfb0065-b364-4530-ada7-cd596003b1fe" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Xreal One:" data-dimension48="Xreal One:" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GGGZbw3taoV5yCC297Ti59" name="xreal-one-render-with-space" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGGZbw3taoV5yCC297Ti59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Xreal One:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65/" data-dimension112="2bfb0065-b364-4530-ada7-cd596003b1fe" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Xreal One:" data-dimension48="Xreal One:" data-dimension25=""><strong> </strong><del>$499</del><strong> $449 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The most premium smart glasses around are finally on sale thanks to Prime Day.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'll admit that I didn't pay much attention to my car charger; it did the job and had two ports, and that was all I needed. But then Baseus came along and showcased what it can do in this category; the PrimeTrip VR2 Max is designed to take things to a whole new level, thanks to 163W of power delivery and four charging ports in total.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the charger comes with two retractable cables. I recently used a UGREEN car charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD">that has a built-in retractable cable</a> and thought that was cool, but it isn't as good as what Baseus is offering. Oh, and the best part? The VR2 Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y">down to just $29 right now</a>, a sizeable 40% discount on its $49 retail price.

The inclusion of two retractable USB-C cables makes all the difference, and if you need a new car charger, you should just get this. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a car charger that's designed to deal with cable clutter. Both retractable USB-C cables tuck into the body of the charger when not in use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need as many charging ports. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29"><strong>UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger </strong></a><strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD"><strong>$27 on Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Look, I can talk about the power budget and go into detail on how the four ports allocate the 163W available, and how the USB-C1 port goes up to 67W. But I don't need to do all that; all you need to know about this car charger is that it has two retractable USB-C cables — each extending to 31.5 inches — and they neatly tuck into the charger when not in use. There's an additional USB-C port alongside USB-A connectivity if two cables aren't enough.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that the charger swivels? It has 180-degree vertical rotation and 270-degree horizontal rotation, so you can easily route the cables to whichever part of the car you or your passengers are sitting in. I used this charger for the better part of two months now, and it has been nothing short of brilliant.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

There's not much to decide here as Samsung only launched two colors this time, and both come in two size options each.

Whether you choose the 40mm or 44mm option, it looks good in both. However, Silver isn't as versatile as Graphite when it comes to matching with outfits.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="here-s-how-you-should-choose-the-right-galaxy-watch-8-color-for-yourself-2">Here's how you should choose the right Galaxy Watch 8 color for yourself</h2><p>Settling on one of the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> color variants isn't a tough call to make. You either go for Silver or Graphite, and the watch bands are secondary. Since the bands can always be swapped out to suit the outfit or occasion anyway, don't focus on them when making your choice.</p><p>I highly recommend opting for the colorway that matches the majority of your clothes and accessories. For example, I prefer to wear gold or rose gold accessories, so a Silver Galaxy Watch 8 would clash awfully with most of my jewelry. That's why I'd personally buy the Graphite variant of the Watch 8. I can always swap the straps to a golden metal link one to glam it up or make it look more elegant. Golden doesn't look that bad with black. I'm sure you get the gist.</p><p>So, if your bracelets and clothes lean more towards a silvery aesthetic, you should get the Silver option instead. It's going to be a thousand times easier to style.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Bellini does echo the current Headliner look, but it'll be worth watching if these distinct designs actually make it to shelves.</p><p>These code names aren't new, as they were also mentioned in a May report by The Information, linking them to future Meta eyewear releases.</p><h2 id="smarter-longer-lasting-2">Smarter + longer lasting</h2><p>According to XR Research Institute, both models boast significantly longer battery life compared to the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray‑Ban Meta glasses</a>. And they could pack smarter AI too, with features like real-time object detection and scene recognition.</p><p>These rumored features line up with what The Information reported earlier—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">a “super sensing” mode that could keep Meta AI running for hours</a>, a big leap from the current 30-minute limit.</p><p>Potential new tricks include reminders for forgotten items and facial recognition: imagine being told someone's name as soon as they walk into view.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.53%;"><img id="yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1038" height="867" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.83%;"><img id="jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="882" height="854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Beyond facial recognition, Meta’s AI might soon get even smarter. Picture it reminding you to grab your keys if you forgot, or nudging you about groceries as you head home. The super-sensing mode keeps the cameras and sensors running nonstop so the AI can stay locked in on your day-to-day activities.</p><p>Here’s where timing gets interesting. XR Research Institute thinks these models might arrive before the year’s end. But The Information puts Aperol and Bellini off until 2026.</p><p>Currently, Ray‑Ban Meta glasses come in various frame styles (Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler), all compatible with clear, sun, polarized, and Transitions lenses. But this rumored pivot to separate optical and sunglass models could signal a bold new direction for the lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

scenarios. The only issue with the keychain is that the keyring is on the smaller side, and it isn't possible to hook a finger inside the keyring. I just took out the tracker and put it on another keyring, and that solved the problem.</p><p>Another annoyance is that these trackers are limited to the Find My network, and they don't show up on Google's redesigned Find Hub. So you'll need to have an iPhone to take advantage of the trackers; I would like to see Satechi roll out Android-based versions of these trackers, but that's not on the cards now. If you've got an iPhone and want reliable Qi-enabled trackers, the FindAll collection gets my recommendation.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You can also choose between wired and wireless charging options. Wired car chargers are significantly more efficient compared to slower cordless picks, and Anker and UGREEN's options are the best in the biz.</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-car-charger-retractable-cable">Anker Nano 75W Car Charger</a> and UGREEN Nexode Car Charger 90W are on sale for the four-day Amazon Prime Day shopping bonanza. This means you can score super fast charging upgrades for your car on the cheap while the sale lasts. The bonus is that you don't need to worry about buying a cable either, as both car chargers come with retractable USB-C cables.</p><p>I have used both car chargers and found them equally suitable. They both offer a plug-and-play experience. In terms of the built-in cable size, I give Anker the win over UGREEN because it's got a slightly longer 29.4-inch or 75cm cable, whereas the UGREEN cord measures 70cm long. However, UGREEN's option has more ports and can deliver a higher power output.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger plugs into your car's cigarette lighter port.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used over a dozen ultra short throw (UST) projectors over the years, and AWOL Vision's LTV-3000 Pro has the distinction of being one of the best. The projector is straightforward to set up and use, and you don't need to mount it on the ceiling or the other side of the room; as it uses UST tech, you can position it just a few inches away from the wall and still get up to a 120-inch projection.</p><p>The projector has 4K as well as Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in addition to HDR10+, and it does a fantastic job with 4K content. It gets bright enough that I didn't see any issues with it even with plenty of ambient light, and if you've already had a projector and want to switch to a brighter model or need to set up a home theater, this is one of the best models available today. The LTV-3000 Pro retails for $3,999, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F?">Prime Day it's available for $2,449</a> — its lowest price yet.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.87%;"><img id="SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC" name="ltv-3000-pro.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The LTV-3000 Pro has outstanding picture quality, and you can easily use it in a room with lots of ambient light.

The LTV-3000 Pro is hassle-free to set up and use, and after a year of use, I can confidently say that it has held up wonderfully. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want built-in Android TV, or you don't need UST tech. In that case, I'd recommend getting the VisionMaster Pro 2; it is considerably brighter, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valerion-VisionMaster-Pro2-Triple-Projector/dp/B0DSBYCZJR">coming in at $2,389 on Amazon</a>, it is also a good deal. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong>XGIMI Aura 2 </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong> $2,149 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The only issue with the LTV-3000 Pro is that it doesn't get Android TV installed out of the box. Instead, you get a dongle in the package. This way is honestly better as you can use your own solution — I use the projector with the Shield TV Pro. Other than that, it doesn't have any shortcomings.</p><p>The 2,000 lumen brightness ensures the LTV-3000 Pro gets bright enough even with ambient light, and this hasn't been a problem whatsoever in the year I used the projector. Color quality is outstanding thanks to the laser light source, and it excels at 4K Dolby Vision and HDR content. The built-in sound is great in its own right, but I suggest using it with a soundbar to unlock its full potential — I connected it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-smart-ultra-dolby-atmos-soundbar-ideal-rocking-out">Bose's excellent Smart Home Ultra soundbar</a> and Bass Module 700 subwoofer.</p><p>I use the LTV-3000 Pro with a 90-inch projector, but it goes up to 150 inches, making it the ideal choice if you're just getting started with a home theater. The projector is clearly built to last, and the picture quality gives it a definite edge over most models in this segment. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F">deal pricing of $2,449</a> makes it that much more alluring; it's still quite a lot of cash, but you're also getting one of the best 4K UST projectors available today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thanks to GaN III, it doesn't run too hot, and at the same time, the charger maintains a tiny footprint. The Voltme 100W GaN III Charger has one USB Type-A and two USB Type-C ports. It supports QC 3.0, PD 3.0, and PPS fast charging, making it the ideal charger for just about any device, be it a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.</p><p>There are very few reasons why you'd want to skip this deal. The only explanation would be that you either already have such a powerful charger or you're searching for something higher than 100W.</p><p>Don't forget that a charger like this requires a compatible charger to tap into that max 100W charging speed. In fact, any charger over 60W needs a 5A e-marked cable. If that went over your head, don't worry.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used Fluke's multimeter and measuring tools extensively over the years, and when the brand said it was rolling out a thermal camera, I was immediately excited. I have a dedicated thermal camera, but it's much more convenient to use a dongle-sized variant that just plugs into your Android phone.</p><p>This is basically what you get with the iSee thermal camera, a diminutive thermal camera that's available with USB-C or Lightning connectors. I used the USB-C model, and it works just as well with any Android phone. The dongle usually sells for $499, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">Prime Day it is down to $430</a>. This dongle almost never goes on sale, so if you need a diminutive thermal imaging camera, I highly recommend picking it up. And if you need a Lighting-based model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0CYT1553Q">that's down to $433</a>.

It has good resolution, plugs into just about any Android phone, and has a range of effects. It detects up to 500 °C/932 °F, and lets you record 25fps footage. </p><p><strong>Other retailers 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.fluke.com/en-us/product/thermal-cameras/fluke-tc01a-tc01b" data-dimension112="7b596534-b076-494e-804b-9d025f00b7d7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers 💵:  $499 at Fluke" data-dimension48="Other retailers 💵:  $499 at Fluke" data-dimension25="$"><strong>$499 at Fluke</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a small thermal camera you can use anywhere. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need the highest resolution. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-P2-Pro-Resolution-Lightning/dp/B0DHGSH174"><strong>Thermal Master P2 Pro </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-P2-Pro-Resolution-Lightning/dp/B0DHGSH174"><strong> $239 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7b596534-b076-494e-804b-9d025f00b7d7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers 💵:  $499 at Fluke" data-dimension48="Other retailers 💵:  $499 at Fluke" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The iSee is inherently portable, and it weighs just 22g. It's automatically detected by the iSee mobile app when you connect it to your Android phone, and it accurately detects any heat spots — I use it extensively to test how hot phones get while gaming. The resolution of 256x192 isn't the best, but it is more than adequate for a thermal camera, and what I like about the dongle is that it detects minor differences in thermal readings.</p><p>You get a range of presets available, and there's even the ability to shoot 25fps footage. The build quality is fantastic; it has a metal chassis, and I didn't see any issues in the six months I used the product. While there are smaller products available, Fluke's consistently-accurate readings and monitoring tools make the iSee an easy recommendation. As I said above, this dongle doesn't usually go on sale, so if you need a thermal imaging camera to monitor heat zones around the house or identify any leakage issues, you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">should get it now</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

That's why I like what Mecool is doing with its range of Android TV solutions; the brand delivers good hardware and a great value, and the KM9 Pro Max continues the momentum.</p><p>The KM9 Pro Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">now available for just $63</a>, and that's a terrific value when you consider just what you're getting. The box runs Google TV based on Android 12, includes AV1 decode, and has Netflix integration. Basically, it's a reliable solution if you need an affordable Android TV box, and the interface is just as fast as the Shield TV Pro.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1476px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.07%;"><img id="eFQ8iyyMcXc4Cr9TrsU9kE" name="km9" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFQ8iyyMcXc4Cr9TrsU9kE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1476" height="1477" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The KM9 Pro Max showcases just what's possible with budget Android TV boxes. It is just as fluid as NVIDIA's best-selling Shield TV Pro, and you get an unmatched value. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a budget-focused Android TV box with easy access to the Play Store and good fluidity. There's no lag while using the KM9 Pro Max, and it does a great job in daily use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need Dolby Vision. In that case, you'll need to get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S" data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63">costlier KM2 Plus</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cbe928aa-60b7-4013-b407-0d004f0c80ea" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension48="costlier KM2 Plus" data-dimension25="$63">View Deal</a></p></div><p>There really isn't much to fault with the KM9 Pro Max. Configuring it is just as easy as any other Android TV box, and it runs the latest iteration of Google TV. While I'm not a fan of what Google is doing with its TV OS, there isn't any lag or slowdown while using the KM9 Pro Max — it is fluid like few boxes in this category.</p><p>You get full access to the Play Store, so you can easily install all your streaming utilities, including Netflix. There's AV1 decode, letting you take full advantage of HDR within YouTube. Although the box comes with 2GB of RAM, I didn't see any issues with lag whatsoever, and Mecool deserves credit for optimizing the UI. You get 32GB of storage as standard.</p><p>The bundled remote has good in-hand feel, and comes with all the buttons you need — and yes, there's a mute button. I don't get why most brands omit the mute button, but I'm glad it's there on the KM9 Pro Max. Overall, this is a reliable Android TV solution if you need something on a budget, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">at $63</a>, it delivers a better value than its rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, this $250 discount helps offset the price increase, bringing the total down to $550, which is just $50 more than the standard price for the lower-end Pixel 9a.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday" target="_blank"><u><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></u></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="84775112-9e6f-4c7c-b780-062a585a5d5f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.00" data-dimension48="Was: $799.00" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qyD4RiFaC3Ciy2jxFPmYJi" name="Google Pixel 9" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyD4RiFaC3Ciy2jxFPmYJi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 ✨</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" data-dimension112="84775112-9e6f-4c7c-b780-062a585a5d5f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.00" data-dimension48="Was: $799.00" data-dimension25="$"><del>$799.00</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank"><strong>$549.00 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"I can confidently say that this is a very good phone, with enough power and good enough cameras to get the job done.

Google is known for its camera quality, and the Pixel 9 is no slouch. And the photo editing features make it easy to reimagine part of your image, remove distractions, and much more.</p><p>I've used the Pixel 9 on and off since it launched nearly a year ago, designating it as my "camera phone" for moments when I know I'll need a good photo or two. It's just that reliable, and Google has really stepped up the quality of both its hardware and software. You'll also really enjoy the bevy of AI features, which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip is perfectly capable of handling.</p><p>The biggest omission on the Pixel 9 is the lack of a telephoto lens. However, even then, the AI-enhanced digital zoom does wonders, allowing you to zoom up to 8x with minimal loss of quality. It's things like this that help to fill the gaps, ensuring the Pixel 9 retains as much of a flagship experience as possible.</p><p>You can always pay more for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, or you can pay less for the lower-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>. However, the Pixel 9 is a fantastic compromise between these devices, perfect for most people.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-67">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The only major downgrades are the missing mic & speaker for phone calls and the dive-proof design for scuba divers, and most people would give those up to save hundreds of dollars!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension48="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension25="$609.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCZZ9F?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.23%;"><img id="JKA3VJNqUBG3e3RjPzPM4P" name="garmin-epix-pro-gen-2-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKA3VJNqUBG3e3RjPzPM4P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>also: Epix Pro 47mm - </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCRDT9?th=1" data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension48="also: Epix Pro 47mm - $999.99" data-dimension25="$609.99"><del>$999.99</del> <strong>$617.78 at Amazon<br></strong></a><strong>Epix Pro 43mm - </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFCX667?th=1"><del>$999</del><strong> $649.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>I've included all three sizes, since these Prime Day Garmin deals tend to sell out quickly.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a> is one of the worst Android phone deals I've seen in some time, and you shouldn't buy it.

Its retail price of $699.99 is already cheaper than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE by a wide margin, but this Amazon Prime Day offer takes another 29% off, hitting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Camera-Spritz-Orange/dp/B0D3JKR27K/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">standout $499.99 deal price.</a></p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is a year old, but so is the hardware inside the "new" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

It starts with only 128GB of base storage, so you'll need to pay even more than that high $899 sticker price to match the Motorola Razr 2024. It's also powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chipset, a year-old platform based on the 4nm process that likely isn't much better or worse than the MediaTek chip inside the Razr 2024.</p><p>It's clear that the Razr 2024 is the better choice. It comes with 256GB of base storage by default, features the same 8GB of RAM, has bigger screens, and includes a higher-capacity battery with faster charging speeds. No matter which way you look at it, the Razr 2024 is better overall than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE — even if their costs were equal.</p><p>Of course, they aren't! This deal price for the Razr 2024 brings the flip phone down under $500, whereas the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-order around the $900 mark. If you were hoping the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE would be your next affordable foldable, fear not, because the Razr 2024 is all that and more.</p><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong></strong></em></li></ul><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-82">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2499727057430809917-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is here: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2203694892823443518-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2511409197821828773-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Chromebooks: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dchromebooks%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7106176835731580750-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 28% off Chromebooks</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3246680232717780065-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Plus, since it's compatible with USI pens, you can detach it from the keyboard and turn the Duet 11 into a drawing tablet or digital notebook.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fbd62d1f-4d59-4d69-98d8-e9521c09639c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $399" data-dimension48="Was: $399" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-duet-11-chromebook-11-2k-lcd-touchscreen-2-in-1-tablet-mediatek-kompanio-838-4gb-ram-128gb-emmc-with-keyboard-luna-gray/6597397.p?skuId=6597397" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FjxYmhcv7wJ2iNHdzjyjmh" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-square-render.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjxYmhcv7wJ2iNHdzjyjmh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="584" height="584" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 (4GB/128GB) 💻</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-duet-11-chromebook-11-2k-lcd-touchscreen-2-in-1-tablet-mediatek-kompanio-838-4gb-ram-128gb-emmc-with-keyboard-luna-gray/6597397.p?skuId=6597397" target="_blank" data-dimension112="fbd62d1f-4d59-4d69-98d8-e9521c09639c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $399" data-dimension48="Was: $399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-duet-11-chromebook-11-2k-lcd-touchscreen-2-in-1-tablet-mediatek-kompanio-838-4gb-ram-128gb-emmc-with-keyboard-luna-gray/6597397.p?skuId=6597397" target="_blank"><strong>$269 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>"It turns out that even if there's not much competition, a company can release a device that offers a slew of meaningful upgrades.
