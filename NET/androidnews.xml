Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Sometimes, learning can seem a little unfavorable, but Google is rolling out an AI update for the arts and sciences that might make it exciting, if not wacky.</p><p>Announced this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/ai-cultural-learning/">Google highlighted </a>an AI experimental update for its Arts & Culture app that can merge you or someone you know into an educational clip. Something that stands out in this AI update is the app's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/kQGgmM6Aoohkrw">World Toon Video</a>" experiment. According to its notes, Google says users can take a selfie, which will be placed into a generative AI "educational video clip" narrative.</p><p>After snapping a selfie, users can swipe through their "style," such as puppet, cartoon, old cartoon, and more. Then, you'll select a "scene." This is what determines the educational reason behind your character cruising across the moon or snaking through a dense jungle. Google's AI will generate your character and the setting before animating it into a video clip.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q91qkXwMKKc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The second Arts & Culture experiment is called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/qwGvFCEHA4HpQQ">Learn Everything</a>." This feature was designed on the basis that regular things in our lives can actually become a cool teaching moment. Google's notes state, to get started, users need only take a photo of something mundane: a coffee mug, a light bulb, or a plant. The AI will use your photo as a "metaphor" for that teaching moment, which users can decide after.</p><p>Per Google's example, users can take a photo of a light bulb and tell the AI that it wants to learn about Stellar Evolution at an Intermediate level (there are also Beginner and Advanced levels).</p><p>The AI will generate that explainer, using your photo as fuel, shortly after.</p><p>The final experiment, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/art-chat">already available in the Arts & Culture app</a>, is "Arts Chat." It's a similar experience users who've engaged with AI chatbots will recognize. Google states users can converse with the AI in "real-time" about famous artists and their work, as well as watch "explainer videos" about art genres. Of course, the backbone of this feature is Gemini, so that leans a little more into that recognizable experience.</p><h2 id="never-forgotten-2">Never forgotten</h2><p>It seems as if Google's AI knows no bounds, as it's even toiling away at features (even if experimental) for its Arts & Culture app. There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-arts-and-culture-redesign">a larger update</a> a while ago, which brought new goodies, like an Inspire feed and AI poems. Joining the Inspire feed was the app's Explore tab about artifacts and historical/cultural stories. Additionally, the AI poems were brought to users by Google's PaLM 2 model.</p><p>What was generated could be sent to friends or family, as well.</p><p>Also, the app's new World Toon Video seems like an extension of what the app already had: Art Selfie. Users can take a selfie of themselves and see it transformed into a historical art piece that others can guess where it's from. It's a little bit of a game mixed with educational learning, which, at the end of the day, might help you kill some time, at least.</p> ]]></dc:content>

My colleague and Senior Content Producer at Android Central, Nicholas Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">agrees wholeheartedly with me</a>. Both Sutrich and I agree that it gets impressively small, shrinking down to 13 inches, and doesn't weigh much. Thus, it is perfect for travel as it fits in a backpack easily, too.</p><p>While the magnetic mount does swivel up to 180 degrees, it would have been nice if it could rotate a full 360 degrees. And while the base isn't as sturdy as some of the more expensive and bulkier tripods out there, that is to be expected with something this compact and lightweight.</p><p>You can use the built-in Bluetooth remote to capture photos and videos remotely. The little remote is usually docked into the tripod's body magnetically. It charges via USB-C, which is another upside of the KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sony excels at ANC, with the headset doing a magnificent job tuning out ambient sounds. Combine that with the fit and all the extras you get, and the XM5 still holds up against the XM6.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a design with foldable hinges. While the XM5 folds flat, it doesn't have an inward-folding mechanism.</p><p>The WH-1000XM5 has been around for two and a half years now, and considering Sony didn't change the design at all with the WH-1000XM6, you're not missing out on anything in this area. Having used both headsets extensively, the only difference is that the inward-folding hinges on the XM6 make it easier to carry around — that's it. Outside of that, you get a similar level of comfort, and the XM5 is just as lightweight.</p><p>Sony is in the lead when it comes to ANC, with the XM5 doing an excellent job tuning out any ambient noises in your surroundings. It does this to a greater extent than Bose, and it is evident if you travel a lot — the whine of a jet engine isn't as audible. Outside of that, you get solid Bluetooth connectivity, a good level of customizability, and a transparency mode.</p><p>Sound quality is another area where Sony excels; the brand has a distinct sound signature, focusing on an engaging low-end with exaggerated sub-bass that makes listening to music highly enjoyable. Battery life is great too, and if anything, you can easily get 30 hours out of a full charge, and there's fast charging available as well.</p><p>All of this is to say that the WH-1000XM5 is still a great headset in spite of the XM6's introduction, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B09XS7JWHH">Sony discounting it to $248</a>, I'd suggest getting the XM5 if you're ready to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

No, I don't use it like a traditional tablet, but instead, it sits on the Charging Speaker Dock and operates as my smart home hub. This is where it excels the most, at least for my needs, as I have other tablets that handle things like gaming or working.</p><p>Unlike some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, the Pixel Tablet doesn't really do anything spectacular. It's kind of the same feeling that I get when using a Pixel phone that isn't the Fold, as it just serves a purpose without any frills. Frankly, it's pretty refreshing when you think about the different ads and features that are sandwiched into other tablets, which really only serve to slow everything down.</p><p>The elephant in the room here is that we're just a few months away from when the last Android OS update is expected to come to the Pixel Tablet. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">June 2026</a>, the only updates the Pixel Tablet will receive will be the monthly security patches, which are slated to continue until June 2028.</p><p>There's been speculation about Google offering a way to re-purpose the Pixel Tablet, but we haven't really seen anything concrete. That said, it's not like the tablet will be completely abandoned in 2026, we just won't see any major Android OS updates come to it.</p><p>Even still, at $249, this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-tablet-11-android-tablet-128gb-wifi-porcelain/JJ8T5CC93R/sku/6578701">one hell of a deal</a>.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Look, we all want something for nothing on Black Friday. The day has a pedigree for a reason, but it looks like one company is living up to our obnoxiously lofty expectations: <em>Samsung</em>. If you grab a Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uzgexaa/"><strong>directly from Samsung</strong></a> this Black Friday, you'll get the $1420 512GB model for a ludicrous $859 <em>out the door</em>. No trade-in nonsense, no financing silliness, and no carrier contract.</p><p>Samsung makes that offer even better by including the three Samsung.com exclusive colors, something that normally isn't included in deals like this. To put this deal in perspective, <strong>Amazon is offering the 256GB model for $899</strong>, meaning you'll not only pay $40 for the "privilege" of paying off Jeff Bezos' next rocket, but you'll also be getting <strong>half</strong> the amount of storage. The same scenario plays out at Best Buy, Walmart, and elsewhere.</p><p>In other words, if you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> this year, get it straight from Samsung and stop looking elsewhere.

Not only does the company offer Black Friday's best discount, but it doubles the storage, offers exclusive colors, and even allows you to trade in your old phone or finance the device to make it easier to purchase.</p><p>I'd recommend buying unlocked through Samsung, as the carrier variants of the phone don't seem to offer any additional discounts over today's ludicrous sale. An unlocked phone typically resells for a higher value down the road, and also offers you the chance to easily switch carriers at any time without having to deal with their BS.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Many of us are totally fine with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phone</a> as long as it gets the job done, and that's why I've been loving the Pixel 9a since its launch in March 2025.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> brings many of the features you find on flashy flagship Pixel phones, but at a lower price, and this Black Friday, it's getting even cheaper.

As soon as Google releases updates, the Pixel 9a gets them too. It was one of the first phones to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, and thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset, it'll get the same seven years of OS updates as the other phones in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><p>I personally use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> as a beta device to test new Android versions, and at this price, you might want to consider doing the same if you want the latest Android experience without risking your daily driver.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VPBvnm4yMbwXXZYQEACLk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VPBvnm4yMbwXXZYQEACLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apart from that, you get great battery life as well, something we can't say about all Pixel phones. The Pixel 9a packs a 5,100 mAh battery that easily lasts a full day without reaching for a charger. Plus, you get the signature Pixel camera with consistent results in all conditions, something most budget phones simply can't match.</p><p>Sure, there are downsides to an A-series phone. For example, the bezels around the Pixel 9a's display are fairly thick, and there's no telephoto camera on the back, which means no optical zoom apart from the 2x crop on the main sensor. But these are expected limitations for a budget device.</p><p>All that said, if you're looking for a new smartphone this Black Friday without spending too much, or want to gift someone a phone without worrying about fancy flagship features, the Pixel 9a is more than good enough, especially considering it'll be supported long term.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Grabbing a Meta Quest 3 at Best Buy today will get you a $75 Best Buy gift card, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3-512gb--virtual-reality-headset-without-wires-thirty-percent-sharper-resolution-2x-graphical-processing-white/6554912.p"><strong>making it effectively $425</strong></a>.</p><p>Everyone's got someone who wants something at Best Buy this holiday season (maybe that's you!), making that gift card nearly as good as cash. The Meta Quest 3 is Meta's highest-end VR headset, combining the best of crystal-clear VR imagery with its advanced Pancake lenses, with the impressive power of color passthrough mixed reality.</p><p>That means you'll get the best of both the virtual and real worlds with this headset, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/laser-dance-meta-quest">amazing mixed reality games</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/these-new-meta-quest-games-reminded-me-that-vr-magic-hasnt-faded-yet">immersive virtual reality games</a>, all without needing to plug it into a console or PC. The Meta Quest 3 is a standalone VR console, which means you can take it <em>anywhere</em> and play whenever you want.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1184b542-67b1-48ec-a629-a72919954ce1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, $75 Best Buy gift card, plus three months of Meta Horizon Plus at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, $75 Best Buy gift card, plus three months of Meta Horizon Plus at Best Buy" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3-512gb--virtual-reality-headset-without-wires-thirty-percent-sharper-resolution-2x-graphical-processing-white/6554912.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3YdJhoJWw8jAejG37VJMcQ" name="Meta-Quest-3-product-render-w-space.jpeg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3YdJhoJWw8jAejG37VJMcQ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Meta Quest 3 512GB: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3-512gb--virtual-reality-headset-without-wires-thirty-percent-sharper-resolution-2x-graphical-processing-white/6554912.p" data-dimension112="1184b542-67b1-48ec-a629-a72919954ce1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, $75 Best Buy gift card, plus three months of Meta Horizon Plus at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, $75 Best Buy gift card, plus three months of Meta Horizon Plus at Best Buy" data-dimension25=""><strong>$499.99, $75 Best Buy gift card, plus three months of Meta Horizon Plus at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is FINALLY on discount for Black Friday, but it's not a "traditional" sale.

The Meta Quest 3 features the clearest lenses of any major VR headset but its mobile chipset can be somewhat limiting on visual quality. In that case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/"><strong>grab a PSVR 2 for $100 off instead</strong></a>.</p><p>While there are several other VR headsets to choose from, none offer a better overall experience than the Meta Quest 3. Here's what you can expect from the Meta Quest 3 experience:</p><ul><li>Thousands of available games, including hundreds of exclusives like Batman Arkham Shadow, and Deadpool VR.</li><li>Top-notch visual quality thanks to high-end Pancake lenses.</li><li>No wires needed: just put it on your head and play games.</li><li>Unique mixed reality games that transform your room into a virtual playspace.</li><li>Freedom to walk anywhere and be more immersed in virtual worlds because of natural movement.</li></ul><p>After you pick the headset up, I recommend checking out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ultimate-meta-quest-3-and-3s-starter-kit-2025">ultimate Meta Quest 3 starter kit guide</a>, which will set you up with the best accessories you can outfit your Quest with. Everything you need to get started is in the Meta Quest 3 box, but these accessories will help you get the most out of the experience, including improved headset and controller comfort, longer battery life, unique accessories like haptic vests, and more.</p><p>If that deal is still a bit expensive for your budget this year, take a look at the more budget-friendly Meta Quest 3S, instead.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4cf0549c-6446-406c-a835-41abd1e69ed9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.costco.com/p/-/meta-quest-3s-128gb-with-12-month-meta-horizon-subscription-bundle/4000385949" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK" name="meta-quest-3s-official-render-with-controllers-square.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2304" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Meta Quest 3S 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.costco.com/p/-/meta-quest-3s-128gb-with-12-month-meta-horizon-subscription-bundle/4000385949" data-dimension112="4cf0549c-6446-406c-a835-41abd1e69ed9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199 with 12 months of Horizon Plus at Costco</strong></a></p><p>The best out-the-door deal on the Meta Quest 3S is from Costco this year, taking a clean <strong>$100 off</strong> the normal price AND including a full year of Horizon Plus, Meta's Game Pass-like service that gives you access to dozens of free games each month.

It's cheaper because it includes less storage and uses the same lenses from the Quest 2, which aren't as clear as the mainline Quest 3. They play the same games and have all the same capabilities, though, making this an incredible pick if you're not nitpicky about the visuals.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus obviously makes standout Android phones, and the manufacturer embarked on an ambitious undertaking 18 months ago where it created one-off accessories by partnering with other brands. The most well-known collaboration to come out of this was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/oneplus-keyboard-81-pro-review">OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro</a> mechanical keyboard that was made by Keychron.</p><p>We also got a power bank, made by Sharge. Now, if you haven't come across Sharge, the Chinese accessory maker is known for its industrial design, and its products tend to be wild — like the Sharge 170 power bank. Anyway, Sharge collaborated with OnePlus last year over a 10,000mAh 3-in-1 power bank, and it has a modular design that's just plain cool. The power bank itself is standard and has a vertical design, with a unique red cable that's even more distinctive than what OnePlus usually bundles on its phones.</p><p>But where it stands out is a magnetic attachment that lets you charge the power bank, or use it as a dedicated wall charger. The best part is you get USB PD 40W alongside SuperVOOC 55W charging, making this the best power bank to use with any OnePlus phone. The icing on the cake is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/sharge-Charging-10000mAh-Portable-SUPERVOOC/dp/B0D7J513XG">power bank is now down to $42</a>, and now is the best time to buy it.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c3e5b59f-295f-416f-8aa7-8a5d947d222a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="There's no doubt that this is one of the best power banks if you have a OnePlus phone.

This power bank is particularly useful if you have a OnePlus phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a power bank with a bigger battery, or want one with 100W USB PD charging.</p><p>I'll say right now that you can plenty of better power banks that cost about the same. The one I use daily is the Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh power bank, and it costs just $36 now and attaches magnetically. Where the Sharge variant stands out is the design; most power banks don't draw too much attention, but that isn't the case with this one — thanks to a metal housing up top and a modular attachment, this power bank is built to stand out.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="J2bh5wdk9fEcqKgotYYU66" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J2bh5wdk9fEcqKgotYYU66.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SgcVtVfe8yheEYFzNJmqD6" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SgcVtVfe8yheEYFzNJmqD6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="H2yoSmDYsqNvqxnxKJjiD6" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2yoSmDYsqNvqxnxKJjiD6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4eFgMCNNsZRt9cvzbnFk46" name="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank" alt="OnePlus Sharge 10,000mAh Power Bank review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4eFgMCNNsZRt9cvzbnFk46.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It is on the bigger side, and I have 20,000mAh power banks that are roughly the same size. That said, one half of the power bank is basically a wall charger, and it attaches to the battery via magnetic pogo pins. You can charge two devices with the power bank simultaneously, and use the wall charger with a third device.</p><p>Another standout is the 55W SuperVOOC charging; if you use a OnePlus phone, you know that you only get 10W charging with most power banks, and that's not an issue here. While it isn't a given that this power bank will get anywhere close to the kind of mainstream attention as UGREEN and Baseus products, it is pretty noteworthy in its own right, and I like it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the most impressive discount might be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/"><strong>$100 off</strong></a> PSVR2 bundle with Horizon Call of the Mountain included. At $299, this is a stellar deal that includes one of the best PSVR 2 games available, giving you a AAA VR gaming experience from the moment you unbox it.</p><p>PSVR 2 requires a PS5 to play, but since nearly 100 million people already own one, you're likely set to enjoy one of the finest VR headsets to date without much fuss. So long as you've got that PS5, everything else you'll need is in this box. The PSVR 2 has hundreds of games to play, including big names like Resident Evil 7 and 8, Gran Turismo, Hitman World of Assassination, and many more titles you're going to love.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P" name="psvr-2-horizon-cotm-bundle-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8dix2b7u4Ehyhs3DVu9Q7P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>PlayStation VR2 Horizon COTM bundle:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-MountainTM-Bundle-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH/" data-dimension112="3a4b1e91-5f80-4c90-9ff7-d1aa2754ed13" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399" data-dimension48="$399" data-dimension25=""><del>$399</del> <strong>$299 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Unlock the power of your PS5 with the PSVR 2 and jump INTO your games.

Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset.</p><p>Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5. Some exclusive titles, like Synapse, even use the PSVR 2's eye tracking to great effect, giving you kinetic powers that you can aim with just your eyes. It's unreal!</p><p>But there's no denying how good the Meta Quest 3S is, all at an even cheaper $199. To make that deal even sweeter, you don't need another console or PC to power a Meta Quest: it's a completely standalone VR console that doesn't use wires or limit your play space, and it has <em>even more</em> exclusive games than the PSVR 2.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.12%;"><img id="vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE" name="meta-quest-3s-w-walking-dead-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWNeMgNGUQRYB5p3BxhFSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="816" height="817" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Meta Quest 3S 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7" data-dimension112="78af7b33-0407-4f27-b31a-dd812ab00362" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>The Meta Quest 3S is currently on sale via multiple retailers for Black Friday, but Best Buy is one-upping the competition by throwing a $50 gift card into the mix.

For people who LOVE to accessorize, this alone is a tantalizing enough feature to want to buy the phone. So of course, I bought a Pixel 10 for myself. There's no way I'd ever use it without a case though, and with a Qi2 phone like this, getting a magnetic case is essential. If you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">phone case for your Pixel 10</a>, I can't recommend these two Mous cases enough!</p><p>While I started out using the Mous Super Thin Protective Clear Case on my Pixel 10 Pro case for months, I eventually switched to the more durable Mous Clarity Protective Clear Case. I am a chronically clumsy person with butter fingers, so the textured sides of the Clarity Protective Clear Case were better suited for me. The sides have a matte, almost sandstone like finish with scored sides, creating an anti-slip effect.</p><p>Other than the features I have already mentioned, both Mous cases for the Pixel 10 also guarantee anti-yellowing over time, and seamless support with Qi2 wireless charging. In addition to that, you also get lanyard holes on both sides of the slightly more expensive Clarity Protective Clear Case.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it seems like some Pixel 10 users seem to be facing a significant software bug that seems to be impacting their Wi-Fi connectivity (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/11/27/pixel-10-quick-share-airdrop-wifi-bug/">Piunika Web</a>)</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/389198355?hl=en">users took to Google's forum</a> to report that opening the Quick Share menu immediately kills the phone's Wi-Fi connection. The user said that as soon as they opened the sharing menu to send a file, the Wi-Fi disconnected. And when they try to reconnect while the menu is open, the network list shows their network, but they won't connect to it.</p><p>According to several reports so far, this issue stems from the new Quick Share extension update (1.0.815689706). According to another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1p3320u/wifi_drooping_issues_after_installing_quick_share/">user on Reddit</a>, their Pixel 10 Pro XL began malfunctioning immediately after the Quick Share extension update. After a quick troubleshooting of the extension, they were able to confirm that the Wi-Fi issue stemmed from this update alone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-side-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What could likely be causing this issue, according to Gemini, is that the standard Wi-Fi hardware (like in the Pixel) is usually built for Wi-Fi Direct (a standard protocol). But now with this new update, Google could be forcing this hardware to emulate <strong>AWDL</strong> (a proprietary Apple protocol), which could be causing the network to get glitchy and drop out.</p><p>While Google hasn't yet officially addressed the issue, some temporary workarounds are being passed around that could help fix this issue. Pixel 10 users have two options to choose from: You can either choose to get rid of this extension until a fix arrives, by heading to <strong>Settings > Apps > See all apps</strong>, locating the "Quick Share extension," and selecting "Uninstall updates."</p><p>Or, if you urgently need to send a file to an Apple device, you can temporarily bypass the driver conflict by manually toggling your Wi-Fi off before opening the Quick Share menu; this forces the transfer to happen via Bluetooth or mobile data, though you may need to restart your phone afterward to connect back to your Wi-Fi.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issue, and we'll update this article once we have more information.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can connect your choice of smart assistant with it and create automations. I personally like to use both Alexa and Google Assistant for all my smart home devices, which is what I've done with my lamp.</p><p>The Floor Lamp can be installed multiple ways, and SwitchBot gives you a bracket and other extras in the box so you can set it up horizontally, vertically, or attach it to the wall if you like. Since it plugs in to a standard wall plug, you can set up the SwitchBot Smart Floor Lamp anywhere, be it as as a corner lamp or next to the couch to elevate and deepen the atmosphere. If you're feeling extra, you can get two lamps and set them up on either side of your TV too.</p><p>The LED Strip Lights have 3M adhesive on the back, so you can stick them wherever you please. The ideal placement would be behind the TV, which is what I prefer. Watching movies and TV shows with the strip stuck behind the TV makes the experience immersive, especially if you match the colors to the vibe of whatever it is you're watching!</p> ]]></dc:content>

In that time, the camera proved to be nothing short of a revelation, and I didn't even use all that much as an action camera, using it instead as a travel shooter.</p><p>The camera has a new 1/1.3-inch sensor that takes brilliant photos and videos, and my wife and I used the camera to take videos of our 2-year-old. We tent not to use phones that much around our toddler, so it was just easier to use the Osmo Action 5 Pro to record footage, and it did a great job in this area. The camera usually costs $349, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Standard-Waterproof-Stabilization-Touchscreens/dp/B0DBQTC2P7">discounted to $259 for Black Friday</a>, making it an absolute steal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4e2627f0-d945-4a84-a485-4f0a0e1b32fc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Thanks to a new sensor, the Osmo Action 5 Pro takes outstanding photos and videos — even in low-light conditions.

The Osmo Action 5 Pro has a high-quality sensor, image quality is excellent, and the built-in stabilization ensures you get smooth footage while doing any outdoor activities.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need an adjustable field-of-view. If that's the case, consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Essential-Variable-Aperture-Cold-Resistant/dp/B0FNMP8LZX">getting the newer Osmo Action 6</a> (it isn't discounted yet).</p><p>The Osmo Action 5 Pro is built tough; it took several tumbles over the course of the last six months, and the chassis is still pristine. It has IP68 ingress protection and withstands submersion in up to 20 meters on its own, and it's safe to say that the build quality is better than just about any other tech product I own.</p><p>The video quality is terrific; the action camera has a 155-degree wide-angle view that's pretty great during travel, and it does a good job with 4K120 footage. I didn't see any issues even with low-light situations, and you get standout slow-mo footage and excellent stabilization.</p><p>I also like the dual OLED panels; they're easy to use, and the one at the front is a nice addition — it makes framing that much more convenient. It has 47GB of built-in storage, but you can easily slot in a MicroSD card. Battery life is quite decent as well, and I didn't see problems while transferring footage to my phone. Honestly, I didn't think the action camera would be as good, and it's an easy recommendation — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Standard-Waterproof-Stabilization-Touchscreens/dp/B0DBQTC2P7">particularly now that it's down to $259</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It now appears the company may have cleared the biggest hurdle blocking the phone's U.S. availability.</p><p>When the OnePlus 15 launched on November 13, 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">OnePlus told us</a> the phone wasn't arriving in the U.S. alongside the rest of the world due to the lack of FCC clearance.</p><p>For those unaware, every electronic device sold in the U.S. must be cleared by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) before it can be sold to customers. This ensures the device meets government radio and communication standards.</p><p>However, due to the government shutdown from October 1, 2025, to November 12, 2025, OnePlus couldn't get official FCC approval for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>. Even though the phone had already passed testing at all FCC-recognized labs, the final approval from the U.S. government was pending.

While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fccidlookup.com/fccid/2ABZ2-OP24865">official document</a> doesn't mention the OnePlus 15 by name, this model number lines up with the device.</p><p>For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> model number in India is CPH2745, while the FCC listing shows CPH2749, which should correspond to the U.S. variant.</p><p>This theoretically means OnePlus has now obtained all required certifications to launch the phone in the U.S. OnePlus previously said that once approved, the company would try to bring the phone to "customers in the U.S. expeditiously," but we haven't heard anything official yet.</p><p>That said, we do know the OnePlus 15 will cost $899 in the U.S. once it launches officially.

The DH2300 has an elegant design, Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, plenty of power, and great software.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need M.2 storage.</p><p>Honestly, UGREEN knocked it out of the park with the DH2300. The NAS gets a new design that looks elegant, and it's extremely easy to install hard drives inside the enclosure. The NAS is powered by a Rockchip platform, and it does a great job in regular use — I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><p>While it may not have some of the extras that you see on higher-end models — like M.2 SSD slots — the DH2300 is astonishingly good. If anything, the 4GB of RAM and the internals mean it isn't anywhere as limited as you'd imagine a NAS in this category to be. Realistically, if you're just looking to store your phots and videos from your phone and other data, there isn't a need to get another NAS; the DH2300 does a terrific job in this area, and you even get NFC pairing that lets you connect your phone.</p><p>The software has plenty to offer as well, and you even get container management, so you can easily install any utilities that aren't provided by default. Having tested many entry-level models over the years, the DH2300 has proven to be a revelation, and it is without a doubt the best starter NAS around today.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DH2300-2-Bay-Capacity-Diskless/dp/B0FNWHSPXF">price coming down to $167 for Black Friday</a>, there's just no reason not to get this NAS if you're looking to get started with a home server.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You also get up to four years of software support, so the phone will receive updates through 2028.</p><h2 id="razr-plus-2">Razr Plus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-01" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a fancy plate with its cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, if you want something a little newer and with a bit more power, you can always get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-review">Razr Plus 2025</a>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2B1Z5KL/"><strong>also on sale right now</strong></a>, and comes with a larger cover screen, faster chipset, and better cameras.

However, there's one Black Friday tablet deal in particular that stands out, as the Lenovo Tab One is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/"><strong>on sale for 50% off</strong></a> over at Best Buy.</p><p>Take one look at Lenovo's tablet lineup, and it's basically an encapsulation of the wide variety that Lenovo offers as a company. It all starts with budget-friendly options like the Tab One, but with a Black Friday deal like this, we're venturing into "impulse-buy" territory.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ" name="lenovo-tab-one-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnnrKGkUALzFBN42E4n6uQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo Tab One (4GB/64GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.99</del> <strong>$79.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>It's not often that I feel comfortable recommending a tablet under $100, but the Lenovo Tab One is the exception to the rule.

However, the problem with those super-cheap Fire tablets is that they lack the performance to really do much more than use one app at a time.</p><p>Thankfully, Lenovo's Tab One doesn't suffer from those problems thanks to the MediaTek Helio G85. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room for those who plan to use the tablet for more than just media consumption. And if you need more storage, there's a microSd card slot, which is just one of those "nice to have" features.</p><p>That said, this tablet is also great for catching up your favorite movies or shows with an 8.7-inch 1340 x 800 display. Lenovo also equipped the Tab One with Dolby Atmos-tuned dual speakers, providing a kind-of surround sound experience. Plus, the 5,100mAh battery is rated to last for over 12 hours on a single charge, which is better than much of the competition.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-37">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Speaking of deals, some of the newest e-readers from Amazon, launched in July, are already heavily discounted. For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G"><strong>the latest Kindle Colorsoft is available at a 32% discount</strong></a>, bringing the price down to $169. Plus, you can get it at an even better price by trading in an old Kindle for an extra 20% off!</p><p>I've been trying to squeeze in some reading early in the morning or late at night when everything's quiet, so this new Kindle has definitely caught my eye since it came out. I'm currently using the 2021<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-long-does-battery-kindle-paperwhite-last"> Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and I'd totally love a massive color upgrade. Imagine a new Kindle that not only keeps the screen glare-free but also adds a pop of color to those graphic novels! It's been this weird little thing—I really want the cover of the book on my Kindle to actually have color, making it feel like I'm holding the real copy, and I think this is as close as it gets.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.99%;"><img id="MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW" name="Kindle-Colorsoft-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MapS6Kj2vPWV59sRx6h6bW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="888" height="879" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" data-dimension112="2496de9e-88e7-437f-8038-8e4777a950fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft: $249.99" data-dimension25="$169.99"><del><strong>$249.99</strong></del><strong> $169.99 on Amazon</strong></a></p><p>At just $169, you’re getting the full Colorsoft experience—vibrant book covers, color-coded highlights, and readable comics—without the "early adopter" premium.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is reportedly making its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">Circle to Search</a> feature simpler to use with this nifty new feature. The tech giant seems to be testing a change that invokes AI Mode at the bottom of the screen, which makes the Google Search bar appear.</p><p>For instance, you're looking up some shoes you spotted on Instagram, earlier Circle to Search would show you the best results that match your search, along with links to the product. But if you need to do a follow-up search, then you'd have to use the search bar at the top to type in your query.  And this may be changing.</p><p>The new interface is said to simplify follow-up queries on Circle to Search(as spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/circle-to-search-ai-mode/"> 9to5 Google</a>). It will feature a Google Search bar at the bottom of the screen, displayed alongside the initial search results. This allows you to easily look up additional information while keeping the first set of results visible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1688px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4fE623DoUWDd5V4P5mdEvV" name="Circle-to-search-AI-Mode" alt="Google is quietly testing this nifty feature on Circle to Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:2,l:9,cw:1657,ch:932,q:80/4fE623DoUWDd5V4P5mdEvV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1688" height="950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5 Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI Mode is activated by tapping "Ask anything," which features a microphone icon for voice input. This experience includes a 'plus' menu for accessing Nano Banana, and a set of suggested queries that keep the existing "Circle to Search" context. Once a prompt is entered, the user is directed to the full AI experience.</p><p>This looks a lot like the experimental pill-shaped bar that Google was testing way back in 2021 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-bottom-search-bar-redesign-on-android">popping up again in late 2024. </a>Google was trying out a bottom-positioned search bar with a cool new Material 3 design to make the Android app better, and now it seems to be showing up in Circle to Search, too! That said, this feature appears to have shown up on the latest Google app beta (version 16.47), and it isn't available to the wider audience as yet. It remains unclear if and when Google will start rolling out this update.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Why did the search bar move to the bottom?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The move is likely designed to improve one-handed usability and to signal a shift to "AI Mode." Previously, the search bar was at the top of the screen. By moving it to the bottom, it mimics the layout of other conversational AI tools and allows you to view the initial image or text results (which stay visible) while typing or speaking your next question.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

But my fellow reviewers and I had to acknowledge how expensive they all were, with mid-range models priced like flagship watches and the most expensive ones costing as much as a great smartphone.</p><p>Black Friday (temporarily) solves this, bringing the prices down to what they <em>would</em> have cost if Garmin acted like other smartwatch brands and treated upgrades as the norm, not an expensive add-on perk. In particular, the $100-off Forerunner 570 is an excellent deal, bringing the price down to what its predecessor originally cost.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-570-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-aluminum-indigo-aluminum-2025/JXF9YFFYHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2wmCnKAxA2f7swJjXjurCP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wmCnKAxA2f7swJjXjurCP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="920" height="920" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Forerunner 570 is a fantastic running and multisport watch. Compared to the excellent <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review" data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99">Forerunner 265</a>, its AMOLED display is 0.1 inches larger and twice as bright, you get a distinct aluminum bezel instead of plastic, and its next-gen HR sensors are more accurate with skin temp included. </p><p>It only weighs 3g more than before despite adding a mic & speaker for calling, and you get new software perks like a Triathlon coach and evening report. For most Garmin fans, most of the upgrades are nice to have, but not essential, so this Black Friday deal will make the upgrade more tempting.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-forerunner-570-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-aluminum-indigo-aluminum-2025/JXF9YFFYHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9cd78d27-fd0b-44f2-936a-1e5dbc15db02" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 265" data-dimension48="Forerunner 265" data-dimension25="$449.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Likewise, it's much easier to recommend the Instinct 3 AMOLED now that its price has fallen to $399 ($100 off). As much as its sporty design and up to 24 days of battery life will appeal to die-hard Garmin fans, its price was a bit too high considering you don't get "unlimited" battery life or offline maps. Now, it matches the Instinct 2 series' original pricing, while giving you new perks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="410ff070-5c86-45c6-b575-b9212d19d0f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Instinct 2 Solar" data-dimension48="Instinct 2 Solar" data-dimension25="$349.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-instinct-3-gps-smartwatch-45-mm-amoled-black-with-black-band-2025/JXF9YF5WX9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tTMFynRu5L4r6db3T3zGRn" name="garmin-instinct-3-amoled-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTMFynRu5L4r6db3T3zGRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>You can choose between a 1.2- or 1.3-inch AMOLED display with excellent battery life or <em>months</em> of battery life with the MIP version, with its upgraded Solar panel that turns time outdoors into extra lifespan.

It's <em>really</em> hard to recommend at the original $800 price, but at $200 off?

My previous one was showing its age, so I replaced it with the Sony Ult Field 1, and it's been one of the best purchases I've made.</p><p>The speaker is surprisingly light, so I can either carry it with the built-in strap or stuff it in a bag. It has a durable design, so you don't have to worry about having it out at the beach. I also appreciate that it has buttons so I can control the volume and easily pair it to new devices.</p><p>For a relatively small Bluetooth speaker, it's surprisingly loud. I've had it at a few outdoor gatherings, and it's more than enough to keep small and mid-sized groups entertained. It sounds great and has plenty of bass, but you can also up the bass if need be by pressing the Ult button. I rarely find that I need to do this, but bass heads will definitely appreciate the kind of sound you can squeeze out of this small speaker.</p><p>And while sound is already pretty good, you can pair the speaker with a second Ult Field 1 to achieve a true stereo experience. I only have one, but with a deal this good, there's little reason not to get a second speaker.</p><p>You'll also appreciate the long battery life. I've rarely found myself running the battery down, even after seemingly using the speaker for what feels like an entire day. And if you find you need a charge, you can always whip out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/anker-nano-power-bank-a1638-hands-on">portable power bank</a> to keep the party going.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-47">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon's Black Friday Week sale has chopped $100 off the Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth speaker</strong></a>, which is our pick for the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker out there for Android users.</p><p>This is the second generation of the Sonos Move speaker, and the company launched this one with improvements to battery life, connectivity, and sound quality overall. The Move 2 comes with a USB-C port for charging, though it also comes with a convenient charging stand for the first time in the company's history of audio products.</p><p>To be sure, the Move 2 is much larger than many of today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>, and while it does have a handle, it's not quite as portable as some with more stowable shapes and sizes. Still, if you don't need it to be super small, it might be worth considering, especially if you want something that can achieve rich bass tones, crisp vocals, and a broad frequency range backed by a high-performance, precision-tuned woofer.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.00" data-dimension48="$499.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:842px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.15%;"><img id="weSqAchKKwjinzt4f7RrTo" name="sonos-move-2-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weSqAchKKwjinzt4f7RrTo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="842" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sonos Move 2 Bluetooth Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Move-Wireless-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B0CGGYYK2D" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.00" data-dimension48="$499.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$499.00</del> <strong>$399.00 for Amazon's Black Friday Week</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped $100 off the price of the Sonos Move 2 speaker for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, bringing the price of what is our favorite Bluetooth speaker from an audio quality perspective down to just $399. If you're looking for something tiny and portable, this probably isn't the way to go.

Additionally, the Sonos Trueplay tuning features adaptive sound for a multitude of environments, meaning that it will tune the audio to your surroundings when listening.</p><p>While Google Assistant is not available on the Sonos Move 2 due to legal disputes between the two companies, it does offer other voice assistants, including the first-party Sonos Voice Control and Alexa.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Also, Power Saving Mode works only while driving, so it doesn’t support walking or cycling navigation.</p><p>Power Saving Mode offers a simpler, low-power version of turn-by-turn navigation. So if you’re on a long drive and your phone’s battery gets low, this smarter mode could help — unless you’re using an older Pixel or another Android device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9" name="google-maps-psv" alt="Google Maps' power-saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="it-shows-only-what-actually-matters-2">It shows only what actually matters</h2><p>Google’s solution uses a feature called AOD Min Mode, which lets Maps run full-screen on the Always-On Display. Instead of bright colors and animations, you see a dim, monochrome view with a slow refresh rate and a simple interface. It only shows what you need: your next turn, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-chip-to-show-time-to-get-home">estimated arrival time</a>, distance, and little else. Traffic overlays, color-coded roads, constant zooming, and street-name clutter are all removed.</p><p>The actual trigger is simple. Start turn-by-turn navigation, tap the power button, and your phone flips into this low-power mode. The result is a navigation feed that consumes significantly less battery, with Google suggesting you could squeeze up to four extra hours on longer trips. That’s huge for anyone who relies on Maps during commutes or out-of-town drives, especially when you’re nowhere near a charger.</p><p>For Pixel 10 users, Power Saving Mode is already enabled by default. You can turn it off in Google Maps settings if you prefer the full, colorful navigation view.</p><p>If the company does expand it — and it should — this could become one of the most useful navigation features to hit Maps in a long time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And if this one isn't your cup of tea, then you might be interested in the Backbone One, which is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8/" target="_blank">on sale for $20 off</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$169.99" data-dimension48="$169.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mVVD2mU992evSbFhexJoZM" name="backbone-pro-controller-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVVD2mU992evSbFhexJoZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Backbone Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$169.99" data-dimension48="$169.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$169.99</del> <strong>$134.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>As someone who has more controllers than they care to admit, the Backbone Pro is one that I keep coming back to.

I've always enjoyed the previous Backbone One controllers, but after gaming for just 15-20 minutes, my wrists feel like they're on fire. The Pro solved that problem, so now, the only time I experience discomfort is when I get lost playing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/one-of-my-favorite-single-player-xbox-games-just-dropped-to-a-rock-bottom-price">Megabonk</a> or Hades II for too long on my phone.</p><p>Ergonomics aren't the only reason why you should consider a Backbone controller, however. Namely, battery life is rated for up to 40 hours on a single charge, which is important if you're playing a game you just can't put down. Backbone also has a unique "TouchSync" feature built-in that makes its controllers compatible with practically all of the best Android games, even if they don't already have native controller support.</p><p>Backbone might not be as popular of a company as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/i-keep-coming-back-to-this-controller-from-razer-and-its-a-whopping-50-percent-off-for-black-friday">Razer</a> when it comes to controllers, but it's actually been around for a few years. Since the release of the original Backbone One, we've seen a few iterations released for both iPhone and Android phones. In just 2025, Backbone has released the Backbone Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/backbone-pro-xbox-edition">Backbone One Xbox Edition</a>, an awesome Death Stranding 2 special edition controller, and the Backbone Pro Xbox Edition.</p><p>So while it might not have as many options to choose from compared to a company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/i-used-gamesirs-latest-budget-mobile-controller-and-it-has-a-lightweight-design-with-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, Backbone is definitely picking up a head of steam. And for good reason, as these are some of the most well-built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">controllers</a> that I've ever used, to the point that I've never had any issues with any of my Backbone controllers over the years.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-52">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You can do this through the Meta Horizon app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight">Android</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-horizon/id1366478176">iOS</a>) that's used when setting up a new Meta Quest, or go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://auth.meta.com/">Meta's login page</a> and create a new account from there. Only use this account on your Meta Quest and don't follow the tantalizingly easy prompts to log in with one of your other Meta accounts.</p><p>Existing users should head on over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://accountscenter.meta.com">Meta accounts center page</a>, tap <em>Accounts</em> under Accounts settings on the left menu, then remove any accounts that are linked to the Meta account you use on your Quest.

This is a wonderful service that's also a useful way to ward off account breaches since someone would have to have access to your "master" account in order to access linked accounts.</p><p>But because of the way Meta handles linked accounts through its many products and services, one banned account means you lose all access forever. Yes, that even means you'll lose access to games you've purchased since those digital licenses are tied to that account.</p><p>It's heinously stupid and unfairly punishes too many people, since there are plenty of known instances of people's Facebook accounts being erroneously banned. Things are made worse by the fact that companies like Meta, Google, and others don't normally have a way to talk to a human being without jumping through tons of hoops.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iAYhZL8GUav5GAdEUncVCH" name="meta-quest-3s-carrying" alt="Carrying the Meta Quest 3s with a YOGES 3rd party head strap installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iAYhZL8GUav5GAdEUncVCH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wish Meta handled things differently or, at the very least, gave Meta Quest users a way to offload their purchases onto another account if something happened with a <em>linked</em> account. While some people certainly deserve to be banned from using Facebook forever because of bad behavior, it doesn't make sense to take away all their purchases from an unrelated gaming console like a Meta Quest in one fell swoop.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many Meta Quest users have faced this terrible reality and, more often than not, it causes them to swear off the Quest forever. I certainly can't say I blame them, but you can learn from their unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>Trying to get a trillion-dollar company to change things like this is difficult, if not impossible.

The two fitness smartwatches are each priced at $550, placing them in the mid-tier segment. The next step up in price puts buyers firmly in premium territory, with the Garmin Venu X1 costing $800 and the Forerunner 970 going for $750.</p><p>Still, the question of whether to put your $550 toward the Garmin Venu 4 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> is a perplexing one. While the Forerunner is better for running, as the name suggests, it's lacking in other areas compared to the Venu. When you consider the Venu 4 can also handle basic run tracking, it's easy to start looking at that Garmin smartwatch as the more versatile option. Let's compare all the differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a> and the Forerunner 570 to help you decide which one to buy.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-forerunner-570-design-and-display-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Forerunner 570: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="9RK6UG4akMTuTibR5p6zuQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-23" alt="Garmin Venu 4 watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RK6UG4akMTuTibR5p6zuQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the Garmin Venu 4 and the Forerunner 570, you'll immediately notice that these two smartwatches feature completely opposite design styles. The Forerunner 570 is colorful and lightweight, foregoing premium materials like stainless steel in favor of lightness. The flashy, bright colors make it excellent for visibility and good looks while running, but limits how well the Forerunner 570 can dress up.</p><p>On the other hand, you have the Garmin Venu 4 with a stainless steel and fiber-polymer case, plus a fully stainless steel bezel. It looks more premium, with flat sides, fewer buttons, and muted colors. The Venu 4 is also smaller, both in overall footprint and thinness. It's available in both 41mm or 45mm sizes, offering 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch displays.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="npdwsn9vEgdjmiT2LcBJRH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-09" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 on black shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npdwsn9vEgdjmiT2LcBJRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the Forerunner 570 also offering 1.2-inch and 1.4-inch displays, it's larger, with 42mm and 47mm case options. Each watch sports an AMOLED display with a high peak brightness rating of 2,000 nits.</p><p>The watch is slightly thicker, at 12.9mm compared to 12.5mm. However, it's also lighter, which is crucial for a running watch. The 42mm model weighs 42 grams and the 45mm weighs 47 grams, including the strap. By comparison, the Venu 4 weighs 46g and 56g for its small and large size offerings, respectively.</p><p>Both ship with silicone sporty straps, but use standard 20 or 22mm watch bands, so they're fairly easy to swap out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4157px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ir5YSSTcPP2Ge9ouCq4j9Q" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-13" alt="Garmin Venu 4 flashlight on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ir5YSSTcPP2Ge9ouCq4j9Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4157" height="2337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the back, both Garmin watches feature a health sensor and the company's proprietary charging connector.

Each device has a 5ATM water-resistance rating and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-forerunner-570-hardware-and-specs-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Forerunner 570: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-08" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KeEub4SF7CU8oPPRqdgLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of hardware, the Garmin Elevate v5 heart rate sensor is the core of both the Venu 4 and Forerunner 570. The upgraded sensor suite includes a more-accurate heart rate monitor, plus extras like a skin-temperature sensor and blood-oxygen sensor. The features are inconsistent across the devices, though.</p><p>For example, despite both watches using the same Elevate v5 sensor, only the Venu 4 can access the ECG app for electrocardiogram readings. Additionally, it's harder to access skin-temperature graphs on the Forerunner 570 compared to other watches, like the Venu 4.</p><p>Both watches have versatile connectivity tech inside, including Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC, which enables device sync and features like Garmin Pay. There's more storage than before, as the Forerunner 570's onboard space has been upped to 8GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 4</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Forerunner 570</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Size</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 41 x 41 x 12mm</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 45 x 45 x 12.5mm</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 42.4 x 42.4 x 12.9mm</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47 x 47 x 12.9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Materials</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Case: </strong>Stainless steel and fiber-reinforced polymer</p><p><strong>Bezel: </strong>Stainless steel</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Protection</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, Gorilla Glass 3</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 3, 5 ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 46g</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 56g</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>:<strong> </strong>42g</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 47g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm:</strong> 1.2-inch (390x390)</p><p><strong>45mm:</strong> 1.4-inch (454x454)</p><p>AMOLED touchscreen, 2,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 1.2" (390 x 390)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 1.4" (454 x 454)</p><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery life</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm: </strong>10 days (3 w/ AOD), 15 GPS hours, 13 All-Systems GNSS hours, 12 multi-band GPS hours</p><p><strong>45mm: </strong>12 days (4 w/ AOD), 20 GPS hours, 19 All-Systems GNSS hours, 18 multi-band GPS hours</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm</strong>: 10 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-only GNSS mode)</p><p><strong>47mm</strong>: 11 days (smartwatch mode), 18 hours (GPS-Only GNSS mode)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Sensors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, ECG, gyroscope, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Tracking</strong></p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, All-Systems GNSS + Multi-Band</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, SatIQ, multi-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>LED flashlight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>❌</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The software experience on the Garmin Venu 4 and the Forerunner 570 is quite similar, and it's improved compared to past Garmin — and especially Forerunner — models.

The larger sizes of the  Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 can last up to 11 or 12 days, respectively.

As mentioned, the Garmin Venu 4 is better for advanced health metrics, with full support for heart-rate monitoring, blood-oxygen sensing, skin-temperature readings, and ECG recordings. The Forerunner 570 can handle some of those, but not all of them. Considering most mainstream smartwatches offer all those features these days, it's perplexing the Forerunner 570 doesn't.</p><p>The Forerunner 570's five onboard buttons make it easier to use for high-intensity interval training than the Venu 4. Both watches have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">Garmin Run Coach</a>, which can help you train for your next race with personalized workout plans. There are new sport types available on either watch, with over 80 total to choose from.</p><p>In terms of specialized run features, the Forerunner 570 offers AutoLap by Timing Gate detection, Projected Race Time predicting, and Suggested Finish Line estimates. For serious runners, these can be seriously cool — AutoLap can detect a race's course markers and automatically snap your GPS signal to them, ensuring accurate recording of a crowded race with wide routes.</p><h2 id="which-should-you-buy-2">Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DeL3BAmBLwJzc6RF8SASBH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-15" alt="Garmin Forerunner 570 on a dumbbell with Training Effect stats on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeL3BAmBLwJzc6RF8SASBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most fitness buffs, the Garmin Venu 4 is the better way to spend your $550. It has the same Garmin Elevate v5 sensor you'll find inside the Forerunner 570, but the Venu 4 adds ECG support. On top of that, there are perks like a built-in LED flashlight that make the Venu 4 more helpful on a daily basis. With a stainless steel bezel and a refined case designed, the Venu 4 doesn't look out of place when work as an everyday smartwatch.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Garmin Forerunner 570 is a specialized option for serious runners only. If you're the kind of runner that needs five tactical button for precise and quick mid-run controls, grab the Forerunner. The same goes for anyone that cares about the Forerunner 570's lightweight design and strap compared to the Venu's thick and heavy design.</p><p>I'd buy the Forerunner 570 in a heartbeat, because if I ever step foot in a gym, it's to get on a treadmill. Many weightlifters and strength trainers are the opposite — their workouts are done in gyms and on mats. For those buyers, or anyone that wants a full-size smartwatch that can pass with workwear or athleisure, the Venu 4 is the best option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2e4cfc6d-242e-4dfb-aa80-50b067263938">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Premium health watch</strong></em></p><p>The Garmin Venu 4 is a unique offering for people that need more advanced health and fitness metrics than the average smartwatch provides, but isn't a specialized runner, hiker, or cyclist.

What we got was the thinnest foldable on the market, and that includes devices released abroad like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>.</p><p>While Samsung went in-house with the Exynos 2500 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/whoa-the-years-best-galaxy-z-flip-7-black-friday-deal-just-dropped-from-a-very-unlikely-source">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the company stuck with Qualcomm for the Fold 7. As such, we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at the helm, which is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This top-spec model is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-1tb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966udbfxaa/">on sale for $600 off</a> as part of the Black Friday festivities.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, not only did Samsung introduce a completely overhauled design, but we also got a long-overdue camera upgrade. Samsung finally ditched the 50MP wide-angle lens from years past in favor of a 200MP sensor. This is joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto sensor with a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>In fact, the 200MP camera is the same sensor that you'll find in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is an enormous upgrade. If you're interested in seeing how the Z Fold 7 performs, we compared it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-camera-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>In our review, we gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> a 4.5/5 star rating, making this an easy recommendation for anyone who is interested in picking up one of the best foldable phones.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-57">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While other Android flagships embraced triple-digit wattage, the Galaxy S series seemed content to linger at 45W. That's changing soon, if previous leaks and rumors are anything to go by, and we now have new information about the new branding that will mark this power-up.</p><p>New findings inside early One UI 8.5 firmware, uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/super-fast-charging-3-0-3619931/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, reveal a charging system labeled “Super Fast Charging 3.0." Earlier rumors claimed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-series-may-finally-boost-charging-speeds-for-a-faster-user-experience">Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature significant charging upgrades</a>, with 60W wired and 25W wireless charging, and this new branding may be tied to those upgrades.</p><p>For a company that has stubbornly stuck to 45W speeds on its flagships while competitors sprinted toward 80W, 100W, and beyond, this is the strongest sign yet that Samsung knows it needs to catch up.</p><p>Samsung’s Ultra models have used the same 45W “Super Fast Charging 2.0” branding since the S22 Ultra, even as more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">affordable Android phones</a> adopted much faster standards. That meant Galaxy owners were stuck with longer top-up times if they used their phones heavily.</p><h2 id="internal-proof-2">Internal proof</h2><p>Over the past few months, leaks suggested the S26 Ultra would finally get an upgrade, but nothing looked concrete until this new charging label appeared buried in Samsung’s own software. The internal code shows a higher charging “level” than the current 45W tier, and that’s hard to interpret as anything other than Samsung preparing to push past its long-standing limit.</p><p>While these numbers aren’t as high as those of some other brands, Galaxy users could finally get a faster charging experience. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PEgdznsUz" target="_blank">reliable leaker</a> previously said that it might be possible to reach 70% to 80% in about 30 minutes and cut down the time for a full charge, as long as Samsung manages heat and power well.</p><p>Galaxy owners have complained about slow charging for at least three generations, so an upgrade like this would be welcome news for long-time users. And while it’s not official yet, the firmware code leaves little doubt. If the S26 Ultra really jumps to 60W, Samsung won’t suddenly win the fast-charging race, but it will finally stop losing it by default.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the lawsuit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251124006331/en/Lieff-Cabraser-and-Kaplan-Gore-Announce-Filing-of-Federal-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Google-Over-the-Defective-Google-Nest-Hub-Google-Nest-Hub-Max-Google-Nest-Mini-and-Google-Nest-Audio-Devices">Business Wire</a>), both sides state that the Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, and Google Nest Audio have become faulty and have otherwise "malfunctioned" over the years.</p><p>The lawsuit lists a few issues, such as the aforementioned devices no longer "respond to even basic verbal questions." Not only has the Q&A portion of these Nest devices failed over time, but the plaintiffs state "widespread complaints" have been reported from consumers regarding failure to "interpret or act on voice commands, returning irrelevant information, losing internet connectivity despite a stable WiFi connection, and failing to recognize registered user voices."</p><p>The plaintiffs are calling this a "consumer case," one that aims to receive some sort of compensation for those who purchase these devices that have deteriorated drastically.</p><p>The report explains that user reports indicate that those who've purchased these devices have been forced to stop using them, since their main/primary function no longer works. The lawsuit argues that Google's unwillingness to fix these devices has caused consumers to spend "hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars."</p><p>The Business Wire post cites Darren Kaplan from Kaplan Gore, who states, "However, rather than getting 'smarter' and better over time, these Google ‘smart’ home devices get worse at their core function of analyzing and processing voice commands."</p><h2 id="we-can-follow-this-trail-2">We can follow this trail...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:799px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL" name="Google-Nest-Hub-Max-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Google Nest Hub Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PPzUy8PbD5uuYLFtzz2nL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="799" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lawsuit also states that Google has been aware of these problems, considering users took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice their complaints. The company responded in kind; however, nothing worthwhile has come of that.</p><p>This federal lawsuit is quite timely, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests">Google's been struggling</a> with its Nest devices since January. Reports from the start of 2025 highlighted problems with voice commands, like "What's the weather," as mentioned in the lawsuit. Speakers and displays were involved in this (just like the lawsuit mentions), but Google stated a fix was rolling out, as user reports flooded all channels.</p><p>However, that wasn't the end of it. Jumping to July, and we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-finally-heard-your-nest-and-assistant-frustrations-promises-a-fix">still heard reports</a> of users grappling with unaware and unattentive Nest devices. Users were so incredibly frustrated and raised their voices loud enough that Google's head of Home and Nest went on social media to personally speak with them. At the time, Google "promised" a fix, but there was the impression that a solution wasn't going to arrive until the fall.</p><p>Given the fact that this class action lawsuit has been served, it doesn't look like things have gone according to the original plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've been using them as my primary earbuds for more than a year, and at this price, they're easily one of the best buys you can make this holiday season.</p><p>Right now, Amazon is offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGKMZBZC/"><strong>Pixel Buds Pro 2 for just $134</strong></a>, which is about 40% off their original $229 price.

Having used them for over a year, they're the only pair I carry thanks to their lightweight and compact build that doesn't protrude much from the ears.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f6356178-8f29-4e5f-a503-6e60fd6cf221" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $95 off, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new pair of earbuds.

In addition to this, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer excellent ANC and a comfortable fit for long listening sessions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you use an iPhone as your primary device or require constant multipoint Bluetooth switching between non-Google devices.</p><p>The twist-to-fit design ensures the Pixel Buds Pro 2 stay in place even during intense workouts or runs. The ANC on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is also one of the best I've used. It's not quite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3-level</a>, which practically silences everything around you, but it's definitely better than most options you can get in this price range.</p><p>Plus, if you use Gemini frequently, these earbuds support Gemini Live out of the box, meaning you can have a live conversation with Gemini directly through your earbuds. One of my absolute favorite features is Conversation Detection, which automatically reduces the volume whenever you're speaking so you don't have to remove an earbud to talk to someone.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phone</a>, you'll enjoy the tight integration since these earbuds appear directly in Bluetooth settings, where you can adjust touch controls, ANC modes, and firmware updates. They work just as well with other Android phones from OnePlus, Samsung, or Motorola, too. You'll simply need to download the Pixel Buds app from the Play Store during setup.</p><p>If I had to nitpick, it'd be that these earbuds don't play perfectly with an iPhone. While most Google services work on iOS, Google hasn't made a Pixel Buds Pro 2 app for iPhone. You can still pair and use them, but there's no dedicated app to control features.</p><p>That said, at this price, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> feel like an absolute steal. I recommended them even at their original $229 launch price, but at nearly half off, they're a must-buy.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-42">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has a stranglehold in North America, and that's largely down to the manufacturer cozying up with phone carriers a decade and a half ago. The result is that the brand utterly dominates sales, to the extent that it is seen as the default Android choice when mulling a new purchase.</p><p>This has led to Samsung coasting in recent years, rolling out what is basically the same phone year over year. Thankfully, other manufacturers do things differently, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in particular has been a real standout this year. The phone has a stunning design, monstrous internals, battery life that will make every Samsung user envious, cameras that hold their own against the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a better AMOLED panel.</p><p>In short, the OnePlus 13 is a much better phone than anything Samsung has to offer at the moment, and the best part is that because it's been out for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3?th=1">discounted to $699 right now</a>. Without overstating things, this is the best phone you can get for this amount, and nothing else outshines it — even the newer OnePlus 15. Why should you trust me? I test nearly a hundred devices over the course of any given year, and I used all mainstream phones released in 2025.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dcb744de-3e5e-4396-a44e-7db2a32cb0e1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="At $699, there really isn't any other device that gives you the same caliber of hardware.

The OnePlus 13 has excellent fluidity, amazing internals, standout battery life, and great cameras.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want a good phone, and want to continue using whatever Samsung comes out with every year.</p><p>Even after nearly a year of availability, the OnePlus 13 is a terrific phone. The hardware has no signs of slowing down whatsoever, and it continues to be incredibly fluid in regular use — both at mundane tasks as well as gaming.</p><p>The design has aged well too; the unique leather texture is great to hold and use, and I like that it isn't as grainy as usual leather, instead featuring a softer finish. The in-hand feel is excellent, and even though it has a 6,000mAh battery, it isn't that heavy.</p><p>On that note, battery life is excellent, and I still get a day's worth of use. The AMOLED panel is among the brightest, and you get a level of fluidity that you just don't see on most devices today. It doesn't miss out on any of the extras either, and you get a charger in the box.</p><p>Best of all, the cameras are fantastic; the Hasselblad tuning makes a real difference, leading to photos with great dynamic range and color vibrancy. If anything, I like the OnePlus 13 to the OnePlus 15, and it's much better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and every other Samsung phone. So if you've been a long-time Samsung user and want something better, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3">get the OnePlus 13 while it's still at $699</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 5,000mAh model in particular conveys this well; at just 7.6mm, it is thinner than your phone, and it attaches magnetically without any issues. In fact, I only use the 10,000mAh model as I need a bigger battery — otherwise, I would have used the 5,000mAh power bank all the time.</p><p>Also, the 10,000mAh model gets Qi 2 integration, so if you have a phone like the iPhone 17 or the Pixel 10, this is the ideal power bank to use with those devices. Both power banks get a USB-C charging port to connect to a phone the old-fashioned way, and they deliver fast charging too — the 5,000mAh model does 20W over USB-C, and the 10,000mAh model hits 27W.</p><p>You get 15W charging when used in the default magnetic configuration, and I found that to be adequate in daily use. It's just convenient to just have the power bank connected to the phone and charge it, and the metal design is built to last — I've used both power banks extensively in the last six months, and there have been no problems whatsoever. So if you need a new power bank, I'd recommend getting the Qi 2 10,000mAh Picogo — it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Certified-Wireless-10000mAh/dp/B0DY7J8HPQ">fantastic deal at $36</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I used Hue, Xiaomi, Yeelight, Nanoleaf, and just about every other smart lighting brand (most of which you've never heard of) in the last decade, and when Govee came along, it was a revelation.</p><p>I have over 30 Govee products in the house, and they're all terrific. To say that I like the brand's products would be an understatement, and in over three years of use, I haven't had any issues with the brand, which is something I can't say for any other smart home brand.</p><p>To get to the point, Govee excels at outdoor lights, and the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 are among its best. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Permanent-Waterproof-Halloween-Assistant/dp/B0D14WP9TB">100-feet model is now down to $199</a>, down from its usual retail price of $329, making it a standout deal if you're looking to set up holiday lights.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b25170a9-b343-41dd-9c4a-0473b1c9cd96" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="There's no doubt that Govee does the best outdoor lights, to the point where other brands (hello, Hue) are now emulating what it's doing just to get in on the action.

Honestly, Govee is the best at this, and its outdoor lights have a level of customization that you just don't get with any other brand.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want even more LEDs (I don't blame you). If that's the case, you should consider the brand-new Prism Outdoor Lights, which are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">also discounted heavily right now</a>.</p><p>I used the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 when they launched, and they're terrific to use. They don't take much effort to install, and you get high-quality LEDs with good brightness and color vibrancy, and the Govee mobile app is a slam dunk — it just has so much customization that you won't end up using all the features.</p><p>There isn't much else to talk about. The lights are housed in an IP67 water-resistant shell, and they held up without any issues in India's monsoon, so you should have no problems whatsoever in this area. Also, it's evident that these lights are a big hit; Govee sells a metric ton of these, and while the brand wouldn't give me sales numbers, it indicated that it created a new division solely focused on outdoor lights, so it's clearly dominating in this category.</p><p>I'll admit that the latest Prism Outdoor Lights are even better as they have a trio of LEDs within each light, but they're costly — even with the discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGCZCQMR">they're at $399</a>, or double the price of the Outdoor Light 2. If you don't need the absolute latest, the Outdoor Lights 2 will serve you very well, and at $199, there really is no reason not to buy these lights ahead of the holidays.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The QC Ultra has a neutral sound that allows instruments and vocals to shine, and you still get engaging bass that's full of vibrancy. The noise isolation is among the best of any headset, and I honestly just use the headset without even playing any music at times while on a flight.</p><p>There isn't much different with the QC Ultra Gen 2, and that's how you know its predecessor is truly noteworthy. Bose didn't change the design or sound tuning, instead adding USB-C audio — a nice-to-have feature — and increasing the battery life to 30 hours. Now, the QC Ultra is decent enough in its own right, lasting 24 hours on a full charge, but having that little bit extra makes a difference on intercontinental flights — as I found out on a recent visit to Mexico from India.</p><p>Now, having used both headsets extensively this year, I'd suggest just getting the QuietComfort Ultra; it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489">much better deal at $298</a>, and you're not really missing out on much. If you need the absolute latest from Bose, the QC Ultra 2 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0FDKR293G">obvious choice at $399</a>. With that done, I'm going to return to my in-flight movie.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One of those is the Marshall Emberton III; while it's significantly smaller than the Kilburn or Stanmore, it still somehow retains the classic Marshall styling, and it also has terrific sound quality.</p><p>It usually costs $179, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">now available for $149</a>, which makes it a great choice if you need a new Bluetooth speaker that sounds as good as it looks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="594adde0-3a5b-48c2-b3ae-55a816bbebe1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Although it may not be a huge discount, the $30 savings makes the Emberton III that much more affordable, and that's always a good thing.

You can take this speaker anywhere, and while it doesn't look that big, the sheer volume of sound coming out of this thing will astonish you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need 3.5mm out; Marshall doesn't have this mode on the Emberton III.</p><p>The Emberton III does a great job bringing Marshall's signature design to a smaller size. It is just as easy to take on the road as other portable Bluetooth speakers, and it doesn't weight that much. The distinctive styling gives it an advantage, and yes, I know that the design by itself doesn't mean much, but I like the way the Emberton III looks quite a bit, and it's one of the reasons why I use it.</p><p>Then there's the sound; I use the Kilburn II and Stanmore in my house, and while I didn't think the Emberton III would get anywhere as loud, I was astonished by its sound quality. It has an engaging bass and clear mids, and it gets loud enough even in a mid-sized room that I don't bother taking any bigger speakers these days. Oh, and battery life is pretty great too, and I only charge the unit once a week.</p><p>It also gets physical controls via a jog-wheel, and that's another thing I like a lot. There's IP67 dust and water resistance as well, and on the whole, the Emberton III has proven to be nothing short of incredible in the three months I used it. So if you need a new Bluetooth speaker, I'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">suggest just getting this one while it's at $149</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A network attached storage server allows you to store all vital data in a centralized location, and you can also use it as a media server.</p><p>I tested dozens of NAS models over the last decade, and I now manage over 500TB of data in total. In the last two years, I've been using UGREEN's NAS servers like the DXP4800 Plus and DXP6800 Pro. UGREEN is a new entrant in this category, but it made waves thanks to its strong hardware offerings, and the DXP4800 Plus is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best NAS models you can buy today.</p><p>While the NAS usually costs $699, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">now down to just $559</a>, bringing it down to its lowest price yet.

The DXP4800 Plus comes with 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, all the ports you need, and it has hardware transcoding.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software. UGREEN is doing much better in this area now, but UGOS still has some way to go.</p><p>Obviously, the hardware is the biggest selling point of the DXP4800 Plus. UGREEN somehow managed to deliver the best hardware in this category, and having this level of power in a 4-bay NAS is just great. The 12th Gen Intel platform does a terrific job, and you get hardware transcoding, a must-have if you use Plex and need it on older devices.</p><p>The 8GB of RAM and built-in SSD that houses the OS is good to see, and you get four HDD bays, two M.2 slots, and a metal chassis that's built to last. Another differentiator is 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, ensuring the NAS easily holds its own for several years to come. What I also like is that there's 2.5GbE connectivity alongside it.</p><p>I also like the sheer customizability. If you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS, and that's just highly convenient. This is a big deal, and it makes using the DXP4800 Plus that much more enticing, as you can easily switch out the software — this isn't the case with most NAS brands.

The Sony WH-1000XM4, which were first released back in 2020, have been my ride-or-die cans for years now, and even though I have newer headphones with more high-tech features and arguably better sound, I simply can't quit my XM4s. </p><p>Of course, I'm not completely nuts, so I wouldn't suggest buying the Sony WH-1000XM4 at full price these days.

Powerbeats started it off in the early 2010s and have evolved into the Powerbeats Pro 2, which launched earlier this year. Then, in 2021, Beats expanded its workout earbud lineup to include the smaller, more versatile Beats Fit Pro. That model was just upgraded and rebranded to Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>The new features and name changes confirm what we already knew — Powerbeats Pro 2 and Powerbeats Fit are the two premier workout earbuds from Beats and represent some of the best options on the market for athletes. But which Powerbeats earbuds are best? Let's find out.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-design-and-fit-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Design and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-eartips.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ9tx6oHLQdt3qZNeXEg6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More so than sound quality or specs, the design and comfort of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Powerbeats Fit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> will set them apart for buyers. While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a large ear hook that wraps around your ear lobe for maximum stability and security, the Powerbeats Fit have a stabilization trick of their own. The smaller Powerbeats Fit earbuds feature wing tips that create a secure fit against the concha of your outer ear. I still prefer the full ear hooks, but it's impossible to ignore how much lighter and more comfortable the Powerbeats Fit are due to the alternative design.</p><p>Compared to the Beats Fit Pro, the Powerbeats Fit have wing tips that are 20% more flexible. This means they should be more comfortable and easier to adjust to your individual ear shape. Beats also made a similar change with the Powerbeats Pro 2, making the entire ear hook more flexible. Our reviewer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/beats-powerbeats-fit-review">Tshaka Armstrong</a> found the Powerbeats Fit to be "incredibly comfortable, yet so locked in my ears," which is high praise for a set of workout earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wing tips on the Powerbeats Fit offer a tighter fit in your ear than the Powerbeats Pro 2. The latter's ear hooks prevent the earbuds from physically falling out of your ears, but the ear tips can still slide out on occasion, requiring adjustments.</p><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 have a larger footprint overall, including the large ear hooks. These earbuds also feature on-device controls, a volume rocker, and a playback button on both the left and right earbuds. While the Powerbeats Fit have a basic play/pause button on each earbud, they don't feature a volume rocker. I love using the volume controls on the Powerbeats Pro 2 to quickly raise or lower the volume of my music during a run without needing a smartwatch or phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-beats-vs-airpods-comparison.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjjeCfAMGxQ8JcHr8uQmte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Powerbeats Pro 2, Beats Fit Pro, Powerbeats Fit, AirPods </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To fit the larger earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is larger than the one for the Powerbeats Fit. It's pocketable, but barely. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Fit case is compact and much more manageable. However, you give up wireless charging compatibility as the Powerbeats Fit case only supports USB-C.</p><p>To help you find a good fit, both Powerbeats models support the Ear Tip Fit Test, found in the iOS Settings app or the Beats app for Android. The Powerbeats Pro 2 ships with five ear tips in the box, ranging from extra small to extra large. Powerbeats Fit offers four, excluding the extra-large size option.</p><p>There is IPX4 certification for each Powerbeats version, which covers basic sweat-proofing and protection against light rain, but not much else. There's no dustproofing here, and only very limited water-resistance.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-sound-and-specs-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Sound and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd" name="beats-powerbeats-fit-earbud-macro-b-side.JPG" alt="Beats Powerbeats Fit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3SLiHeJeUvBCPgSkLZm6Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Powerbeats Pro 2 have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>-caliber internal components, the Powerbeats Fit use older hardware. Powerbeats Pro 2 feature the latest Apple H2 processor, which handles both digital signal processing and active noise cancellation. Powerbeats Fit still run on the Apple H1, an older but still competent audio chip.</p><p>Each set of earbuds features six onboard microphones for crisp calls and to support ANC features. The gyroscope, accelerometer, and optical sensors are also consistent between models. These sensors enable in-ear detection and automatic play/pause when the earbuds are placed in or removed from your ear. Notably, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have an optical heart rate sensor in addition to the basic optical sensor used for wear detection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="xasxPtSRL5DV8ji43JCJJV" name="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-hrm-and-optical-sensors.JPG" alt="Powerbeats Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xasxPtSRL5DV8ji43JCJJV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2's heart rate sensor is based on the sensors used in the Apple Watch, albeit a smaller version.

Powerbeats Fit tend to have a V-shaped reproduction curve, where low- and high-end sounds can drown out the kids. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flatter curve, with strong bass but more balanced overall.</p><p>I don't mind a pair of workout headphones with a bass-heavy sound signature — it can help in noisy environments, like a gym or track. Unfortunately, though, the lack of an EQ means you're locked into Beats' sound profile, and that could be a dealbreaker if you don't like it.</p><p>Both earbuds also support ANC and transparency mode. It's about on par with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 (meaning it's excellent), but it isn't as good as AirPods Pro 3. I tend to use transparency mode for workout headphones like the Powerbeats Pro 2 and Fit to stay aware of my surroundings while running on a path or road. The ANC support ensures that both models can double as everyday earbuds if you'd like.</p><h2 id="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-fit-which-should-you-buy-2">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Fit: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For workouts, the absolute best earbuds for me are the Powerbeats Pro 2. The flexible ear hook effectively makes them drop-proof, the on-earbud controls are easy to use while running, and the newer Apple H2 chip enables new connectivity features. If you value similar things, you'll love the Powerbeats Pro 2. Throw in the built-in heart rate monitor as an added bonus, and it's pretty easy to justify the Powerbeats Pro 2's $50 price premium over the Powerbeats Fit.</p><p>That's not necessarily a knock against the Powerbeats Fit, because those earbuds are better as a daily driver. Due to their smaller size, lightweight design, and improved comfort, Powerbeats Fit can handle life outside of the gym better than Powerbeats Pro 2. They share many similarities with the first-generation AirPods Pro, except for wireless charging. The wing tip design should help them stay securely in your ear during long workouts.</p><p>If the Powerbeats Fit were a bit cheaper, they'd be an easier budget alternative to the Powerbeats Pro 2. However, the price difference is only $50, with the Fit costing $200 and the Pro 2 going for $250.
