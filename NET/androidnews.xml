However, it appears the ongoing issue resulted in subscribers missing both the football game on ESPN and the election day coverage on November 4 on ABC.</p><p>The two streaming giants are currently at odds, leaving fans frustrated and angry as they are caught in the midst of this rift. To give you a quick rundown of what the situation looks like right now, Disney recently asked that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> restore access to ABC just for a day.</p><p>Google denied that request with a public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/" target="_blank">statement</a>, saying that Disney's proposal would "cause customer confusion" since the channel would disappear after that.</p><p>But, Google proposed that Disney restore both ABC and ESPN indefinitely for its users while the negotiations continue between the two. Following the removal of these channels from YouTube TV, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-giving-users-usd10-credit">Google started issuing credits</a> to subscribers as compensation.</p><h2 id="subscribers-miss-out-on-key-sports-and-election-coverage-2">Subscribers miss out on key sports and election coverage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1omidwp/youtube_tv_says_disney_unnecessarily_aggressive/">Reddit</a> to vent, filled with disappointment and uncertainty, and one of them stated that they're extremely unhappy with the way things have been playing out.</p><p>"Disney wants to funnel any viewers who want to watch CBB/CFB to ESPN+/Fubo/Hulu, and now I can't watch football this weekend, and if they don't figure out the contract dispute by early next week, I won't be able to watch UK's season opener. I am unhappy," they stated.</p><p>Despite being offered the credit, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1oksowb/youtubetv_no_longer_streaming_espn_and_disney/">some users feel it is insignificant</a> when compared to the loss they've incurred, and were particularly "pissed" about losing content during peak sports season, with comments mentioning "corporate greed" and saying they "hate them both" (Disney and YouTube TV) for the standoff.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1oksowb/youtubetv_no_longer_streaming_espn_and_disney">YouTubeTV no longer streaming ESPN and Disney owned channels, Google offering $20 credit "if their content is unavailable for an extended period of time"</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball">r/CollegeBasketball</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1omidwp/youtube_tv_says_disney_unnecessarily_aggressive/">some say that</a> Disney is deliberately creating this issue during football season, with the goal that several YouTube TV subscribers would probably direct their frustration towards YouTube instead of Disney.

However, it appears that, in true AI fashion, Google is looking to replace this dictionary box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">AI overviews</a>.</p><p>As spotted by some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1n7ntqa/word_definitions_gone_and_replaced_by_ai_im_pissed/">Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-ai-overviews-word-definitions/">TechIssuesToday</a>), Google seems to be testing this change for select users. Several users have reported that when they search for a word, instead of the traditional dictionary box, they now see AI overviews.</p><p>The rollout doesn't appear to be widespread yet, with Google seemingly testing it with a limited number of accounts, though more users have started noticing it recently. Not everyone is happy with the change, and there's currently no way to revert to the previous dictionary box.</p><h2 id="another-quiet-ai-test-that-changes-the-basics-2">Another quiet AI test that changes the basics</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1n7ntqa/word_definitions_gone_and_replaced_by_ai_im_pissed">Word definitions gone and replaced by AI.

They also show "Key aspects" of the definition and some examples of usage, along with a sound button to hear the pronunciation.</p><p>However, some users have pointed out that AI overviews are missing a few key things, such as alternate meanings of a word, parts of speech like noun and adjective forms, synonyms, and even the Ngram viewer, which showed how often a particular word appeared in books over time.</p><p>Google has been integrating Gemini AI across its core services, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/google-a-unified-purchases-tab-to-gmail-ahead-of-the-holiday-rush">Gmail</a>, Docs, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-scanning-google-drive-android-test-that-identifies-adds-in-a-snap">Drive</a>. While AI overviews have been around for a few months now, the removal of the dictionary box doesn't seem to be going over well with users.</p><p>Of course, a lot could change before a wider rollout, but for now, if you're seeing the new AI overviews for words, there appears to be no way to turn it off.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to DirecTV, consumers left in the dark by YouTube TV's ongoing negotiations can hop into its "Genre Packs." With this pack, it states viewers will find access to shows like <em>Dancing with the Stars </em>and major sports events, like college basketball.</p><p>Vince Torres, chief marketing officer at DIRECTV, states, "With options for free TV, specialized Genre Packs, and comprehensive streaming solutions all on our new and improved experience, DIRECTV makes it easy for consumers to watch what they want, how they want, and when they want. Consumers are taking notice and value our new, reliable, and simple streaming experience."</p><p>Torres also states that DirecTV provides a simple, single platform for viewers just looking to watch what they want. Viewers can do this easily, as DirecTV breaks things down into three important categories: MySports, MyNews, and MyEntertainment. Each one focuses on your favorite sports, elections, world news, and the most popular shows on the air.</p><p>DirecTV highlights its "five-day risk-free trial," which makes it easy for consumers who want to see if the service is worth keeping around.</p><h2 id="directv-shows-up-with-the-content-2">DirecTV shows up with the content</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>DirecTV was making headlines late in October, as it partnered with Google TV to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-reportedly-heads-for-hotels-with-directv-and-a-fully-customized-look">completely revamp and revitalize TV</a> in hotels. DirecTV wants to bring its new "Advanced Entertainment Platform" (AEP) to hotel rooms, a customizable platform that lets hotels tailor it to their needs. Google TV serves as the backbone to this, bringing the streaming services and apps that visitors will seek to tune into.</p><p>More importantly, users can even sign into their hotel TV with their Google account to access their shows. The post states that their information will be wiped to ensure their privacy remains secure.</p><p>As far as the YouTube TV angle goes, Disney's content was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">on the verge of a total blackout</a> for the former's viewers late last month. The deadline loomed heavy, as viewers were at risk of losing out on nearly a dozen of Disney's channels, including ABC and ESPN. At the time, YouTube TV claimed that Disney's proposition during the negotiations could force it to "raise prices" for consumers. Fingers were quickly pointed the opposite way, as Disney said YouTube TV was "exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers."</p><p>When both sides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disney-channels-disappear-from-youtube-tv-as-the-sides-fail-to-reach-deal">failed to reach an agreement</a>, those channels swiftly disappeared. Now, we're completely locked in a stalemate as neither side is willing to budge just yet on a way to return those channels to consumers. The finger-pointing continues; however, as YouTube TV claims Disney has been "unnecessarily aggressive and assertive.' Disney says the opposite, claiming that YouTube TV has blown the situation out of proportion.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are a handful of major updates that users can prepare to witness, starting with real-world landmarks when navigating their travels. The post states that, instead of just going off "turn left in 500 ft," or stop signs and traffic lights, Gemini brings forth more noticeable buildings, like gas stations.</p><p>With that, Google states Maps will inform you to "turn right" at the gas station up ahead or, perhaps, it'll name the nearest restaurant, so you're better informed on when to turn. This "landmark-based" navigation is rolling out to Android and iOS devices today (Nov 5).</p><p>To help you along in your navigation, Google Maps now leans on Gemini for proactive traffic alerts. If there are traffic jams, crashes, or anything that would impede any future travels, Maps will now send you a notification about it. Google states that these alerts can come through "even if you’re not actively navigating," so keep that in mind as these alerts roll out on Android and iOS today.</p><h2 id="gemini-arrives-for-navigation-2">Gemini arrives for navigation</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.97%;"><img id="KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V" name="google-maps-gemini-lens-update-coming-soon" alt="Gemini is headed for Google Maps with Lens in tow, helping users understand the establishments they visit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="484" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:149.63%;"><img id="peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V" name="google-maps-gemini-proactive-alerts-update" alt="Google Maps will soon deliver "proactive" updates about traffic jams, crashes, and more as a pop-up notification on Android and iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="401" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini is, of course, a little more than a preemptive alert or navigational assistor, as the post highlights the inclusion of Lens and multi-step tasks. Regarding the former, Google Maps now has Lens built in with Gemini at its core. Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment. When centered in the viewfinder, Google Maps' classic pin with the spots name will appear.</p><p>Users can voice their query or type it, and let Gemini explain "what's so popular" about the place they're at. Google teases that Gemini can also let you know if a local spot carries something particular you're looking for.</p><p>On the flip side, for multi-step tasks, Gemini can satisfy queries for something "budget-friendly" that also has "vegan options." Users can then lock in whatever destination Gemini and Google Maps produce, simplifying the navigation process to what feels like just a regular conversation. Moreover, Google says users can grant Gemini in Maps access to their Calendar.</p><p>If granted, the AI can throw in new events for you. Now, not all of this is available right away, as Google says Gemini's Lens capabilities in Maps will "roll out gradually later this month" for U.S. users in Android and iOS. Additionally, Gemini in navigation will soon hit Android and iOS devices "in the coming weeks," with an expected arrival on Android Auto in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Once upon a time, e-readers were mainly made by bookstore companies hoping you'd continue to peruse their shelves regularly, even if that's just in digital fashion. These days, brands like Onyx Boox and Bigme have made a name for themselves by making E Ink devices powered by Android, ensuring that you can do more on an e-reader than you ever thought possible.</p><p>This year, we've seen an explosion of color e-readers, as the E Ink Kaleido 3 has become more popular, and Bigme has been releasing new devices at a rapid pace since the spring. I find myself cycling between three of the company's best color e-readers depending on what I find myself reading, but it's unlikely that most people want two or three e-readers lying around the house.</p><p>So that begs the question: what kind of reader are you? Do you enjoy novels and fan fiction? Maybe you prefer graphic novels with a visual twist? How about binging manga series on a perfectly illuminated slab of e-paper? Or maybe you just want an e-ink tablet that's great for writing on, so you can publish your own stories someday. I've got three different-sized Bigme color e-readers here, and I'll help narrow down the best one for you.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

I'm certainly guilty of falling prey to the desire to live as minimally as possible at times, and fitting hundreds of books into a device that's only slightly larger than my phone is a very attractive idea.</p><p>That's where the Bigme B6 comes in. As the name implies, this one packs a 6-inch color E Ink Kaleido 3 display behind a slightly chunky frame. Aside from the size, the unique physical aspect here is the row of 5 capacitive keys at the bottom. I would prefer physical buttons over capacitive ones, but this is an interesting hook nonetheless.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB" name="bigme-b6-navigation-bar" alt="The capacitive navigation buttons on the Bigme B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-01" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-02" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you don't like the default functions, you can assign each button to any of several dozen functions. This was the saving grace for me, as I didn't really care about most of the default button actions.</p><p>The only problem here is that function changes can be a little confusing at first, since these are printed capacitive keys. The AI key on mine, for instance, is set to open the E Ink center for adjusting display settings, and I always pause to think about what the button does before pressing it.</p><p>I'm a bit mixed on the design, too. I hate phones with flat sides and edges, and this feels no different from a plastic-clad iPhone 14-era phone, design-wise. Some people will enjoy that, but that's not me. I'd prefer more rounded edges. Thankfully, the included folio case makes this design feel a bit like opening a book since the sides of a book's pages are normally completely flat.</p><p>If a Boox Palma is a little too small and a standard Kindle is a bit too big, the Bigme B6 fits perfectly in between those sizes as a great little e-reader. It's also hard to argue with the price. At just $179, this is an Android-powered e-reader that's hard to resist!</p><h2 id="e-reading-and-note-taking-2">E-reading and note-taking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG" name="bigme-b7-buttons" alt="The physical buttons on the Bigme B7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just a step up in size is the Bigme B7, another color E Ink Kaleido 3-equipped e-reader with support for a stylus.

Since this runs Android 14 (like the other two Bigme models here), you can run any Android app on it, so your favorite note-taking app is already ready to go.</p><h2 id="productivity-with-a-side-of-manga-please-2">Productivity with a side of manga, please</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zGgNfHxXY8w6jTJXHVmRtS" name="bigme-b1051c-pro-display-android-central-website" alt="Showing off the Bigme B1051C Pro display in sunlight with the Android Central home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGgNfHxXY8w6jTJXHVmRtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last model is one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">I've previously written about</a>, the Bigme B1051C Pro, which was the first new color e-reader I used this year. Despite having a generous 11-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display, this one is an impressive 5mm thin and made of aluminum. It's by far the most premium-feeling product on this page, and that makes sense since it's geared toward productivity and serves as a laptop replacement.</p><p>My unit shipped with a keyboard folio case that includes a built-in trackpad, making the Android 14-powered experience feel similar to a laptop. It snaps into the folio case via magnetic POGO pins, and since it runs Android, it likely has everything you need to swap it out with your laptop.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

E Ink means that this display is great for a variety of tasks, from spreadsheet editing to email or report writing. Bigme even includes a whole productivity suite, so if you don't already have a favorite set of apps, you don't have to go searching the Play Store.</p><p>This one is also my go-to manga reader because of its generous screen size, excellent dual-tone front light, and highest effective resolution. All three of the Bigme e-readers on this page have a dual-tone backlight setup, but I find that the physical design of this one looks more natural than the other models.</p><p>That higher resolution screen also makes a big difference in the little details I enjoy in manga drawings. Additionally, I find that the backlight on the B1051C is the best, with the B6 just slightly behind, while the B7's cool backlight is a little too green for my liking. Check the comparisons in the gallery above to see what I mean!</p><h2 id="a-note-on-color-e-ink-2">A note on color E Ink</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I previously wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/black-and-white-e-readers-arent-obsolete-yet">color E Ink isn't a great replacement for black-and-white E Ink</a> in some situations. Color E Ink isn't as clean or clear as black & white E Ink, and it's also dimmer. That means general readability is reduced, although I wouldn't call it "bad" by any means. It's just not the best option if you only read novels.</p><p>The example photo above uses Onyx Boox e-readers, but all 2025 color e-readers use the same E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, so the same effect applies across all of them. A larger reader, such as the Bigme B1051C, helps mitigate this issue due to its effective resolution, so keep that in mind if this effect bothers you.</p><p>This is the best that color E Ink gets at the moment, although it's possible that a fourth generation of color E Ink devices could provide some improvement in a year or two. Regardless of the differences between color and black & white E Ink, both technologies are far better for your eyes than an OLED or LCD, as they provide passively-lit options and are far more flicker-free than most other modern devices.

It's about the size of a standard paperback novel, but much lighter and thinner, making it more comfortable to read on. IT also includes a handy folio case that makes it look like a small book when the cover is closed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the benefit of an E Ink display over a traditional LCD or OLED tablet screen?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>E Ink displays are passively lit by ambient light, meaning they look very similar to paper. Since natural light can reflect onto the display and illuminate it, these screens are friendlier for long-term reading as they don't need to be artificially backlit to be seen. They're also flicker-free and extremely power efficient, as images stay permanently on the display until otherwise refreshed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can I run Android apps on these e-readers?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>All three Bigme e-readers on this page run Android 14 with full Google Play Store access, so you can add your Google account to them and use all of your favorite apps without hassle.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the most important factor a potential buyer should consider when choosing between the three different screen sizes?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Each device's screen size fits its unique use-case best. The smallest of the three, the Bigme B6, is generally best for reading novels, digital books, and some light graphic novels. The Bigme B7 is a better choice for a portable graphic novel reader and excellent for note-takers, as it includes a stylus in the box. The Bigme B1051C Pro is the largest of the three and is best for manga reading and productivity, as its higher-resolution display better shows details in art and allows for more space in productivity apps.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

That should translate to around two days or more of battery life, depending on usage. OnePlus claims the phone supports 15 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-oneplus-15-s-battery-life-2">Everything you need to know about the OnePlus 15's battery life</h2><p>OnePlus's latest flagship is already available in China and is set for a global launch. When it arrives, it'll come with a few downgrades compared to the OnePlus 13, but not in battery life. OnePlus equipped its newest smartphone with a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, cramming 7,300mAh of capacity into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples">OnePlus 15</a>.</p><p>That's a significant increase over the 6,000mAh capacity of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which also used a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, albeit a smaller one. Compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, silicon-carbon battery cells are more energy-dense, allowing brands like OnePlus to put high-capacity cells into smartphones. The OnePlus 15's battery is 21% larger than the OnePlus 13's, which is significant since the latter already had a reputation for excellent battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 Sans storm editions isn't all just the looks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In practice, OnePlus claims that the OnePlus 15 can last up to 19 hours during continuous video playback. While playing intensive games at 165 FPS, the company says the phone will still last an outstanding 6.6 hours on a single charge. The OnePlus 15 can also be used for navigation for 12 hours straight. Please note that these figures are based on OnePlus' internal lab testing, and the actual battery life of the OnePlus 15 may vary.</p><p>Charging speeds are downright stunning on the OnePlus 15, too. The brand claims a five-minute quick charge translates to six hours of video playback, which is a staggering number. A 30-minute charge will bring your OnePlus 15's battery capacity to over the halfway mark. Not only will it last long, but it will also be quick to recharge.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-charging-speed">OnePlus 15 charges at speeds of up to 120W</a> in China, although charging speeds are typically slower for the U.S. model. The phone also supports 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, and 5W reverse wired charging. A full charge is reportedly achieved in just 40 minutes, another impressive specification for the OnePlus 15.</p><p>All these signs indicate that the OnePlus 15 is capable of achieving multi-day battery life, likely lasting two days on a single charge, although we'll have to confirm this with our own testing. For reference, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review#section-oneplus-13-battery-life-charging-and-performance">our OnePlus 13 review stated</a> that "excellent overall battery life means you'll never have battery anxiety." The OnePlus 15 has the capacity and fast-charging tech to perform even better than that five-star Android phone.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 will surely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones of 2025</a>, and the battery is a major reason why.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="72b255f4-dfa2-4fe9-a6e4-2c7403b1d0e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Battery champion</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 packs one of the biggest batteries we've ever seen in a flagship phone, with a 7,300mAh capacity that dwarfs the competition.

How Google's AI-first strategy and promise of a personalized, 'thinking' smartphone is finally turning the Pixel into a hit, with a huge surge in sales compared to just a few years ago ]]></title>
                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's Pixel is far from the best-selling smartphone. It will never be the best-selling smartphone unless Google builds a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">model under $300.</a> But its sales have spiked since 2022 in ways that any company making consumer devices would love to see.</p><p>I'm not going to go over all the numbers; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">you can read those here</a>. I want to point out that a brand that sold less than 1% of "premium" devices in the U.S. is now selling about 7% of those same phones. That's a 13,900% increase (<em>% change = today-2022/change if you want to do the math yourself</em>), and it's astounding even though the number started so low to begin with. Statistics are fun. (<em>Editor's note: No, they're not.</em>)</p><p>So how did Google do it? What about a Pixel makes 7% of phone shoppers want one?</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The first is that it's not the iPhone or a copy of the iPhone.</p><p>I know, I know, longtime Android users decree that the Pixel (and any other phone they aren't using) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">just an iPhone clone.</a> They're wrong. Looks alone mean nothing; is the iPhone a clone of the Nexus 4, antenna lines and all? Nope.</p><p>Some things just work. Smart companies utilize these tools, even if they're trying to i<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold" target="_blank">nvent a new approach</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold"> in the background</a>. Size, shape, and camera placement are all pretty similar across devices for a reason.</p><p>That's why companies <em>aren't</em> talking about their "unique" device corners or glass edges. Remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-hands">Samsung tried that</a> and it flopped? What they <em>are</em> talking about is what the device can do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We all have to admit they oversell these things whenever they're up on a stage talking about them, but you can not deny that the Pixel, starting around the eighth generation, has branched off into a slightly different kind of phone. One that does a lot of the thinking for you, if you want, and can even make decisions on your behalf. They tell us we really, <em><strong>really</strong></em> want that.</p><p>Other phones can likely do the same, but the fact that the Pixel is ready to do it out of the box is drilled into our consumer minds, and anything we see or hear about it from Google. The iPhone is not. It might not ever be. Apple has an idea of what it wants from an iPhone, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/poll-apple-adopt-rcs-or-bring-imessage-android">the company is stubborn</a>. That's what it will make, and it will not try to chase the features of the Google Pixel.</p><p>The two devices are very different once you get past them being rectangular, glass, and metal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bsnXfM62ZMKeshCpWhMvrD" name="iphone-16-pro-max-29.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bsnXfM62ZMKeshCpWhMvrD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's also why the Pixel is eating Samsung's sales and <em><strong>not</strong></em> Apple's. It might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/this-new-apple-framework-will-make-moving-app-data-from-ios-to-android-seamless">easy to switch from Apple to Google</a> and vice versa, but nobody is doing it. The process might be easy, but years' worth of paid media and apps, gigabytes of online storage, and your (almost) complete online identity aren't just coming with you.</p><p>I've used Android since the very first Android phone, the T-Mobile G1. It would cost me several thousand dollars to switch to Apple and buy everything I would have to leave behind, and countless hours of transferring what I could bring with me.</p><p>I ain't doing all that. Ain't nobody got time for that. You shouldn't do all that without a very good reason, either. If you want something different but not too different, consider getting rid of your Galaxy phone and trying a Pixel. There's nothing to switch unless you tied it to a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-old-inactive-account-purge-advisory"> Samsung account</a> (Don't do that).</p><p>One is no better than the other, but they are presented that way.

Google quickly realized that instead of building all that fancy AI "uniqueness" into Android, it could sell its own products, touting them as the future you want.</p><p>I'm not sure if it really is the future we want or need, but Google wants me to think it is. My Pixel will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">morph into some amazing JerryPhone</a> just by using it alongside all those advanced learning AI features, making it more personal, smarter, and made just for me.</p><p>I will admit that plenty of those little tricks are pretty neat. I'm going to bet that they are also tricks Apple could make Siri or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">Apple Intelligence</a> do, or that Samsung could wrangle into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-will-be-a-glorious-mess">Galaxy AI</a> (and it's starting to do just that), and this is nothing unique to Google.

Google does not stand up on a stage and tell lies about what the latest product it sells can and can't do. It will do everything advertised once you open the box.</p><p>Google just wants to make sure you know that it thinks this is more useful than what other products offer and dares you to try it and see for yourself. It's an opinion that Google is allowed to try to convince you to agree with. And it's working.</p><p>I'll go out on a limb and say that this trend will continue and Google will sell more Pixel phones next year than it sold this year. Smartphone enthusiasts always crave something new and innovative. When we hear the promises (which tend to be mostly true), we bite if we see a device at the right price, especially around the holidays, such as on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Samsung or Apple will have something so new and so good we can't live without it, and we'll see things level out.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How has the Pixel's share in premium devices grown in the U.S.?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>In 2022, the Pixel held less than 1% of the premium market share, whereas by 2025, it had achieved a 7% share of premium devices sold in the U.S., marking significant growth.

This is due to the fact that switching between Android phones is much easier than switching entire ecosystems, even if the process has become easier between iOS and Android.

I'm really impressed with the Pixel 9's 4,700mAh battery; it handles a bunch of apps at once, like endless streaming and social media, without a problem. I use it for monitoring the baby camera for almost 9-10 hours daily, including playing songs on YouTube on loop for when my one-year-old starts to throw tantrums.</p><p>While the Pixel 9's lack of a telephoto lens is a minor drawback, its portrait images are still exceptional.

This could be games, social media apps, and more, and that's exactly what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45348-nothing-os-40-beta-on-phone-3a-series-lock-glimpse-future-plans">Nothing users have been furious about</a> on its community forum (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/04/nothing-bloatware-apps-uninstall/">9to5Google</a>).  User feedback was so immense that Nothing recently updated its community on the state of bloatware in OS 4. The update says, "Following your feedback and suggestions," it will look to make pre-installed services "more flexible."</p><p>The company is also looking to give users "more control" over the bloatware installed on their devices.</p><p>What this means is, beginning "later this month," Nothing will give users the option to completely uninstall the Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services.  Nothing says that it previously only let users disable the aforementioned Meta products, but giving users an uninstall option really puts that power back in their hands. It says that having these on your device brings better stability to the likes of Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>To backtrack, Nothing said in its OS 4.0 Open Beta post that it was looking to pre-install "partner apps and services" to help its BOM costs (Bill of Materials). While the company said this is a common approach, even one that Samsung does, users didn't enjoy it.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google's doing a little house cleaning as we get into fall, revamping the icons of apps you might reach for daily.</p><p>Google has been rocking its four-color classic (red, blue, green, and yellow), but that's undergone some small, more modern changes as of late. In a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/02/google-photos-maps-gradient-icon/">9to5Google</a>, it looks like the company's preparing to bring those same adjustments to a couple of popular apps. Via an unnamed source, the publication states Google is working on revamping the logos for Maps and Photos.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Photos icon redesign is much simpler. It looks like Google will make the individual petals a little wider, and really embrace the rounded mindset. However, when it comes to the gradient, the Photos app doesn't hit quite as hard. The redesign looks like there's more of a bright spot in the center that tries to invoke that gradient, which only comes through modestly.</p><p>You can faintly see how the colors slowly shift between the hues, but perhaps, once it's on our phones, we'll see it in a better light.</p><p>For Maps, Google's changes are more evident, as it opts to increase the pin's center, and smooth the colors, so they seamlessly merge into one another. It's easy to see how the colors blend into each other, going from yellow to orange to red and to purple. The Google Maps icon is a little more stout, too, because the empty center is a little wider.</p><p>Nothing's appeared just yet, but it seems that we should at least expect these icon redesigns to arrive sometime in the future.</p><h2 id="google-s-looking-vibrant-2">Google's looking vibrant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="FK2gSpuoJtDPTyRjBfKQmk" name="google-photos-icon-gradient-redesign-proposed" alt="Google Photos' reported icon redesign offers a brighter center for a gradient effect, while also widening its individual petals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FK2gSpuoJtDPTyRjBfKQmk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="VdyymR8KoDkiFCdohYapkk" name="google-maps-icon-redesign-gradient-proposed" alt="Google's supposed Maps icon redesign, which makes it look a little more stout with a gradient effect on its classic four colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdyymR8KoDkiFCdohYapkk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google's started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-refreshes-g-logo-app-store-update">refreshing its on-device app logos</a>, and even logos present elsewhere, since May. During Google's spring of Android announcements, the company revealed its newer, vibrant "G" logo. Much like what's been reported about Maps and Photos, the Google app got refreshed with a gradient color effect.</p><p>The updated icon was first spotted on the Apple App Store, ahead of its expected arrival on the Play Store. This change was just a prelude to something bigger, which ended up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-redesigns-its-g-logo-to-signal-the-ai-era-is-here">becoming reality late in September</a>. The "G" logo's change shifted in line with the company's AI advancements and tools, like Gemini. The logo's change marked a notable shift, as Google moved more into its AI models and the like, bringing the gradient shift across its entire brand.</p><p>We've been expecting the gradient changes to hit even more apps, and it seems we can at least expect it for Maps and Photos in the future. The only wonder now is whether or not Google Chrome will see a similar change, considering blue sits right in the center of the browser's icon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you’re close to missing an exit, the system gives you early alerts with clear visuals and voice prompts so you can change lanes safely.</p><p>The feature will launch on Polestar 4 models with Google built-in, starting in the United States and Sweden in the coming months. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/polestar-live-lane-guidance/" target="_blank">says</a> this first phase will focus on highways, where lane markings and exits are usually clear, but support for more complex roads will be added later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.17%;"><img id="da3nzk8RsWVyrhmaysncvm" name="Google-Maps-live-lane-guidance" alt="live lane guidance indicated by a blue overlay on Google Maps on a car infotainment system" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/da3nzk8RsWVyrhmaysncvm.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also said that more vehicles with Google built-in will get live lane guidance in the future, but there’s no set timeline yet. For now, Polestar is Google’s pilot partner for the rollout, which makes sense because its infotainment system is closely tied to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-automotive-hands-on">Android Automotive</a>.</p><p>Visually, the feature shows up as an overlay on the in-car navigation screen, where the correct lane is highlighted in blue. If the driver drifts into the wrong lane or needs to switch to make an upcoming turn, the system provides real-time visual and voice guidance to help reposition safely.</p><p>This feature is more advanced than the static lane guidance Google Maps offers on phones. It adapts to real road conditions by using the car’s sensors to confirm your position.</p><h2 id="proactive-safety-alerts-2">Proactive safety alerts</h2><p>Google calls the new feature “customized, real-time navigation help,” and it’s clear why. Missed exits, sudden lane changes, and highway confusion are common driving stressors, and this system aims to reduce them by giving you lane advice when you need it.</p><p>Still, there are a few limitations. Since the system depends on both Google built-in and the car’s camera hardware, it won’t be available on every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-vehicles">Android Auto vehicle</a> or smartphone anytime soon. And because it relies heavily on accurate lane markings and signage, performance may vary depending on local road conditions.</p><p>Even so, this may be just the start. With Polestar leading the way, live lane guidance could soon become a standard feature in the next generation of smart vehicles using Google’s in-car system.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Whether it's a glitch or a hypersensitive new algorithm tracking stress levels, Samsung isn't the first smartwatch brand to confuse and stress its users with sudden data changes, and it won't be the last.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-high-stress-warning-one-ui-8-watch-3612357/">Android Authority</a> first called attention to Reddit posts from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> owners complaining of multiple high-stress warnings per day, having never gotten them before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> update. They also replicated the issue on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>I neglected to notice stress data issues during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic review</a> period. But strapping it on today, I noticed that the watch leaps from Relaxed at my desk to Moderate or High at the slightest provocation. Some feel legitimate, like getting excited while watching a basketball game. But other times, I get Moderate stress simply from standing, or High while pacing around the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vXivTi5zkKN85s6VhDUquZ" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-stress-percentages" alt="A Stress zone breakdown on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the user's time in High, Moderate, Low, and Relaxed zones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXivTi5zkKN85s6VhDUquZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm certainly not stressed, and I flatter myself to say I'm in good enough shape that walking doesn't strain my heart. <em>Something</em> changed behind the scenes in how Samsung determines stress. But because the switch is so drastic, people are more likely to disable alerts and ignore the Stress widget than suddenly assume they've been stressed the whole time.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/has-the-sleep-score-on-your-galaxy-watch-been-weird-lately-too/">SamMobile</a> reported a similar (but inverse) issue earlier this month: Galaxy Watch owners suddenly went from moderate Sleep Scores to earning 99 or 100 ratings after normal nights of sleep. If your smartwatch data is too good to be true, why listen to it?</p><p>We're at the stage with smartwatches and smart rings where companies want them to offer medical insights, measuring for signs of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">hypertension in Apple Watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watches-will-soon-detect-warning-signs-for-heart-failure">heart failure in Galaxy Watches</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/how-enable-loss-of-pulse-detection-google-pixel-watch">Loss of Pulse in Pixel Watches</a>.

But <em>other</em> users experienced hugely inflated step counts, and Google found it easier to return to the old system that tracked normal steps relatively well than try to solve these "certain scenarios" where things went wrong.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nnDuZ7hazAx5n6ziBjbrDP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-14" alt="The back sensors on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnDuZ7hazAx5n6ziBjbrDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's new stress algorithm might be totally off, or it might be closer to accurate than the old system was, just overzealous. Other watches measure my stress as much lower, but there's no way to test if <em>they're</em> more accurate, even if I'd prefer them to be.</p><p>I can compare heart rate against a chest strap, GPS against my actual location, or steps against a physical count. And other stats like passive AFib detection require FDA approval for accuracy. But there will always be "wellness" stats like stress where we can only rely on faith in a brand.</p><p>I'd rather these watches give me accurate data than sugarcoat things; if I'm constantly stressed, tell me. But maybe these brands need to be smarter about easing us into massive algorithm changes. <strong>Tell us</strong> ahead of time that our results might change, and why we should believe the results, instead of assuming we'll blindly accept that we're living much less healthily than we thought.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For example, you can create a video of a woman interviewing an alien simply by typing that description, as demonstrated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/soraofficialapp/status/1985766320194142540">OpenAI on X/Twitter</a>. Moreover, in addition to generating videos, the app also lets users share and remix AI-generated creations.</p><p>While OpenAI already has a video generation model named Sora, this is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI app</a> that takes things further by combining creation and discovery. It functions like a social media platform, featuring a TikTok-style vertical feed filled with AI-generated videos.</p><h2 id="sora-app-brings-ai-video-creation-to-android-phones-2">Sora app brings AI video creation to Android phones</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Sora app is now available on Android in:CanadaJapanKoreaTaiwanThailandUSVietnam pic.twitter.com/wmx5KU4VM1<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1985766320194142540">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>For now, the Sora app is available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.sora">Google Play Store</a> in seven countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. If you're outside these regions, you'll have to wait a bit longer. Even users in supported countries need an invite code to gain access to the app.</p><p>OpenAI says Sora generates "hyperreal videos" with "unprecedented realism," and the app has already been a massive hit, crossing 1 million downloads within just five days of its iOS launch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zVc5XvqmLHrsZcFFUnwnhb" name="sora-app-android-ss" alt="Sora app on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zVc5XvqmLHrsZcFFUnwnhb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you get access, you can generate videos in seconds by simply describing what you want. You can choose from various styles, such as cinematic, animated, photorealistic, or cartoon and even "change the vibe, add scenes, or extend the story."</p><p>Beyond generating videos from text, Sora also includes a "Cameo" feature that lets you inject yourself or anyone else into an AI-generated video just using an image. And even though the technology is impressive, OpenAI has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-sued-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-2025-10-28/">faced criticism</a> for its handling of deepfakes and copyrighted material.</p><p>That said, OpenAI has improved on these issues in recent weeks, and now Android users can finally experience Sora on their devices. For reference, Google also offers a similar tool called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-veo-3-fast-fast-video-creation-vertex-ai-feature-teaser-announced">Veo 3</a> in the Gemini app for Android, which also allows video generation from text prompts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google initially announced in May 2025 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">legacy Duo calling would be replaced by Meet calling</a> completely in September 2025. However, that month came and went without the planned Duo shutdown. Now, a new banner in the Google Meet app explains that legacy Duo calling will stick around for a few more months.</p><p>The updated banner, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-duo-final-meet-transition-3612312/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, now states that legacy Duo calling will be sunset in January 2026. Notably, Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/16176860" target="_blank">support document</a> on the matter still lists the older September 2025 wind-down target, and has yet to be updated. Android Central was also able to confirm the updated warning message on its devices using the Google Meet app.</p><p>Before, the warning message read as follows: “Meet calling will replace Legacy (Duo) calling in September 2025." The latest version swaps the original September 2025 date for January 2026, giving users a bit more time to switch. The rest of the banner reads the same, instructing users to export their Duo data before it's too late.</p><p>"Before this change, export your call history and video messages from your legacy calling account and message settings, or they will be removed," the warning explains.</p><p>Exporting the old data only takes a few steps. Users will need to navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the new Google Meet app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-apps-original-version-is-officially-gone-for-good">not the old one</a>) and tap the <strong>Calling (legacy)</strong> tab. Then, press <strong>Manage legacy call history</strong> and tap <strong>Export legacy call history</strong>. Users will be presented with a spreadsheet file with their Duo call history saved. They'll need to follow similar steps in the <strong>Messages</strong> tab of the Google Meet settings page if they've chatted with Duo and want to save their settings.</p><h2 id="duo-features-will-stick-around-until-january-2026-2">Duo features will stick around until January 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="noF6sphRrraB6GwjwxbveW" name="Google-Meet-Legacy-Duo" alt="The new Google Duo banner in Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noF6sphRrraB6GwjwxbveW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been winding down Duo for a long time now. It first announced the rebrand from Google Duo to Google Meet way back in 2022. Instead of having two different video calling services for personal and workplace users, they were combined. Duo remained in limbo for a few years throughout the transition phase. Then, in May 2025 the initial — now pushed back — shutdown date of September 2025 was set.</p><p>Google Meet has gained numerous features over the years since the transition was first announced. It can do everything from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-improve-your-appearance-in-google-meet">setting virtual backgrounds</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-is-letting-users-trick-their-coworkers-with-halloween-effects">applying AI makeup</a>. However, Duo features like the Family and Mirror modes or Knock Knock will be gone for good when it is sunset.</p><p>Google's extension means that if you're a Duo fan that loves these features, you have a few more months to play around with them before they're removed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, what the report states is that Google's operating system artificially "inflates" the signal (the bars users would see). It cites one key string: KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL. Within Android, this string is repeated several times for several major cell carriers on the market for consumers.</p><p>Android inflates the network signal for Verizon, Tracfone, Xfinity Mobile, AT&T, Bluegrass Cellular, Spectrum Mobile, and several more.</p><p>All of a sudden, there's a sharp change in the narrative, and potentially how consumers perceive the words spoken from some of these carriers. The publication continues, stating that Android's code will "report the signal strength to the user as one bar higher than it really is." It adds that this "always" happens, though it's reportedly unclear who's the one responsible for this artificial inflation tactic.</p><p>Another report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.findarticles.com/google-feature-will-let-carriers-automatically-generate-signal-bars/">FindArticles</a> states consumers can probably work around this, and discover their phone's true cell signal strength. The post highlights the existence of "About Phone" and "SIM Status" details within your device's Settings app. Users can check there to see what their signal strength is (marked by the dBm measurement). FindArticles states the closer your device's dBm is to zero, the stronger it is, adding that -70dBm is great, while -85dBm is pretty much the baseline before spotty coverage takes place.</p><h2 id="an-interesting-development-2">An interesting development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Further digging shows that, apparently, mobile carriers can turn this artificial inflation trick on themselves, though it is disabled by default. An OTA update is seemingly required before cell carriers can trick users with this one-bar higher ploy.</p><p>On a different note, there's already talk of 6G, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizons-6g-initiative-said-level-up-wireless-communication-for-the-world">and it's coming from Verizon</a>. In late September, the cell service announced that it was kickstarting its 6G initiative, as it looked to partner with major brands like Samsung and Nokia. According to Verizon, 6G will "focus" on speed, low latency, and AI integration to deliver a better cell service experience to the user.</p><p>The company also hopes to have a unified global network for 6G, while also hoping to achieve peak data rates of 1,000Gbps. Samsung adds that 6G will deliver lower latency, which only speeds things up for users looking to connect with the world around them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The two companies submitted the filing to U.S. District Judge James Donato, who oversaw a jury trial that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-total-victory-doesnt-mean-as-much-as-it-wants-you-to-think">ruled in favor of Epic in 2023</a>. It requires Donato's court approval before taking effect.</p><p>If approved, the proposal would prevent Google from entering some exclusivity deals with developers, sharing revenue with competitors, or making agreements with OEMs and carriers regarding pre-installed app stores. The settlement also requires Google to adjust Android to make it easier for users to install third-party "Registered App Stores." This updated process would make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">the installation flow for these app stores simpler</a>, reducing user friction.</p><p>Google and Epic have agreed on "neutral criteria" for the registration of third-party app stores, and tell the court the Registered App Stores policy would last until 2032. Donato's original injunction required a different solution for three years, but the two companies say the longer term is beneficial for consumers.</p><p>Google will still be allowed to charge transaction fees on the Play Store, but the proposal would limit fees to either 9% or 20%, depending on the transaction.</p><p>Donato already issued a permanent injunction requiring Play Store changes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">following Epic's victory in this lawsuit</a>.

A leaked version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-disable-samsung-pass-annoying-you-save-passwords-samsung-phone">Samsung Pass</a>, the brand's password manager that uses biometrics for security, suggests the app may gain support for a wide variety of ID cards and biometrics soon. With plenty of rumored feature overlap between Samsung Pass and Samsung Wallet coming in the near future, there's buzz around one app making way for the other.</p><p>The feature preview comes from user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1983981527802507529/photo/3" target="_blank">GalaxyTechie on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, who claims to have uncovered an APK for Samsung Pass version 15.3.01.6. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-pass-passport-id-storage-leak-3611987/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> points out that since the latest Samsung Pass build publicly available is v5.2.06.1, GalaxyTechie is likely actually referring to upcoming version 5.3.01.6.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[APK] Samsung Pass 15.3.01.6 adds "Personal documents" feature to safely store info such as phone number, email, ID card, ID number, driving licence, invoice, TIN, passport etc. You can add these items to Samsung Wallet as well.

Some of these sections are fairly standard, with the documents section supporting uploads of IDs and passports. Users can upload front-and-back photos of their documents, and fill out fields like ID number, expiration date, issuing authority, and more.</p><p>Samsung Pass could also support other personal and business document types that aren't commonly stored in digital wallet apps. For example, the leaked APK shows interfaces for adding invoices and tax identification numbers, which could be handy for business users.</p><h2 id="will-samsung-pass-compete-with-samsung-wallet-2">Will Samsung Pass compete with Samsung Wallet?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ" name="Samsung-Wallet-close-up.jpg" alt="Samsung Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, the leaked version of the Samsung Pass upgrade isn't worth using. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1983998265222984048" target="_blank">Josh Skinner on X</a> notes that most Samsung Pass features unrelated to the new personal documents support aren't working properly. That includes password management features Samsung Cloud sync.</p><p>That being said, if these Samsung Pass features eventually earn a public release, it'll be a notable step. Samsung Pass would immediately become competitive with not only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Apple Wallet. Its support for a wide variety of document types, extending beyond simple IDs and passports, could give it a leg up over other digital wallet apps.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Samsung's plans are with Pass and Wallet, but if these leaked updates are any indication, the two apps will have more feature overlap than ever very soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The top-tier smartphone was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">recently launched in China</a> and is set to make its global debut soon. As you'd expect, the latest and greatest "flagship killer" from OnePlus packs in a wide range of improvements, including a fresh new design, blazing-fast hardware, and a reworked triple-lens primary camera system.</p><p>However, what really makes the OnePlus 15 stand out is its behemoth 7,300mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon battery</a>, which should help make the phone go for multiple days on a single charge. But when that battery does need a top-up, how fast can you expect it to charge?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb" name="OnePlus-15-First-look" alt="OnePlus 15 first look at Qualcomm summit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The short answer is, very fast! The OnePlus 15 can be charged at an astounding 120W, provided you use the brand's own wall charger and cable that utilize the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">SuperVOOC</a> protocol. Similarly, the phone supports up to 50W wireless charging with a wireless charger using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc#section-what-is-airvooc-50">AirVOOC</a> standard.</p><p>It's worth noting that both are proprietary charging protocols developed by OPPO, the sister brand of OnePlus. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger" target="_blank">third-party chargers</a>, the OnePlus 15 can be charged at 36- 55W in wired mode, based on the charging standard (e.g., PPS, PD) used by the charger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the global variant may differ in charging speed due to various reasons, so it may have a slower charging speed outside of China.</p><p>Of course, a gargantuan battery and industry-leading charging speeds are just two of the many goodies that'll make sure the OnePlus 15 earns its spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there.

While we don't have an exact date, we can expect the phones to arrive with One UI 8 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box. We can also expect that Samsung will once again offer up to seven years of OS upgrades and software updates for the phones, a software update promise that it has adopted for the past few generations of flagship phones.</p><p>This is a practice that Samsung started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. But what does this mean for you?</p><p>Well, it means you can hold onto your phone for much longer without worrying about it being outdated. When a new Samsung flagship launches, Samsung normally updates it regularly each month with a new security patch, and after some time, that cadence will slow to once a quarter and then biannual updates toward the end of its life.</p><p>Beyond monthly security patches, Samsung may occasionally provide bug fixes and feature updates. These would be separate from major OS upgrades, which normally arrive once a year with new features, updated UI elements, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Galaxy S26 series, we can then expect owners to continue receiving updates until 2032 and likely receive Android 23 or whatever the software will be called then.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that as time goes on, the aging chipset may not be able to support all the new features that are announced each year, as they will be initially designed to work on newer chipsets before Samsung tries to optimize for older devices/chips.</p><p>Fortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, which is expected to power the Galaxy S26 series, is plenty powerful and should be able to handle much of what's thrown at it over the next few years, including new AI capabilities such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic AI</a>.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what's inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Early Black Friday sales</a> are already here, and we'll see even more in the next few weeks.

You know the one. The subtle desire for that sleek new rectangle nestled in your pocket.

That is the question</em>. But this isn't Hamlet. It's a parsing of promotional promises, and a glimpse into a future where your new pocket companion is smarter, sleeker, and of course, slightly more demanding of your wallet. It's just like a weekend in Vegas; a gamble, and trying to sort it out is like reading digital tea leaves.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-you-might-not-wait"><span>Why you might not wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-13" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The pull of immediate gratification is a powerful force.

A cracked screen spider-webbed across your vision, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-how-can-i-get-more-battery-life-from-my-smartwatch">battery that drains faster than it can charge</a>, or so sluggish that tapping is a waiting game? When it's that bad, the immediacy of a new device trumps the potential savings of Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the anxiety effect. The fear that <em>your</em> phone, the one you've been meticulously researching, will vanish in a digital puff of smoke during the Black Friday frenzy. The algorithms predict demand, but sometimes, even the most sophisticated models are just wrong, and the stock sells out instantly. Buying early can seem like a form of self-care, but you need to make sure.</p><p>And let's not forget the retailers, ever eager to dip into our wallets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025">"early Black Friday" sales</a> are already upon us. It's a gamble, a game of chicken with consumerism. Are these truly discounted delights, or a clever way to exploit our temptation? Occasionally, a diamond emerges from the rough — a genuine deal that warrants immediate action. We worry that we'll miss it when we really need a new phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-black-friday-is-a-tempting-wait"><span>Why Black Friday is a tempting wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC" name="Android-Central-Black-Friday-Deals-2024" alt="Android Central's official Black Friday deals logo for 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Black Friday sales are like a Siren song. They've been etched into our consciousness, synonymous with substantial savings. We're talking price cuts averaging between 30% and 38% on electronics. And while some might scoff at percentages, consider the sheer <em>volume</em> of devices on offer and the potential for significant savings on everything from flagship marvels to budget-friendly workhorses. Chances are someone will have the phone you want on sale by Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the dark magic of carrier deals. "Free" phones dangled like a digital carrot, contingent on new lines, trade-ins, or the bundling of complicated Byzantine plans. A bargain, sometimes one that many find too tempting to resist.</p><p>And it's no longer just a single day. The "Cyber Week" period, stretching from late October through Cyber Monday, has morphed into a sprawling treasure hunt, an extended period of promotions and promises. The sheer volume of what's on offer is overwhelming, but it also presents a big opportunity for a discerning, dedicated shopper.</p><p>Armed with a little research and a dash of skepticism, you can navigate the deal deluge and come out on top, feeling like you made the right decision.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-digital-blackjack-with-real-money"><span>Digital Blackjack with real money</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d" name="Meta-Quest-2-with-cash-money.jpg" alt="Meta Quest 2 headset with lots of cash" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, what is the smart play? What is the right Black Friday strategy?</p><p>Be aware that if you crave the latest and greatest, you'll likely have to pay a premium. Black Friday may offer carrier deals on new devices, but the real savings often lie in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"> <em>last year's</em> flagships</a>. Consider your typical 2-3 year upgrade cycle. Is a slightly older, yet still powerful, device a worthwhile compromise?</p><p>If your phone is on its last legs, don't suffer. Explore existing early Black Friday deals or strong carrier trade-ins now. You might be able to save a few dollars had you waited, but you can't be sure.</p><p>If maximum savings are your ultimate goal, then Black Friday is your battleground. But be a savvy shopper:</p><p><strong>Do your homework: Research prices </strong><em><strong>before</strong></em><strong> the sales begin.</strong></p><p><strong>Read the fine print: Especially for "free" or heavily subsidized phones.</strong></p><p><strong>Consider older flagships or refurbished options for amazing value.</strong></p><p><strong>Most importantly: Track prices to ensure a genuine discount, whether you're buying now or waiting a few weeks for the "big sale".</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the decision is yours. Decide what matters most – immediate gratification, or the deepest possible discount on a slightly older model. Black Friday has evolved into an extended event, and shopping for big-ticket items has become more challenging than ever.</p><p>Me? If I needed a phone right now and a suitable device showed up at the right price today, I'd buy it. If I just wanted something new or could hold out for a few weeks, I'd wait to see what was on offer for Black Friday.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You just got a massive new video recording stability upgrade that's going to make your aging smart glasses feel like new again.</p><p>Just this week, Meta started pushing out firmware v19.2 to <strong>all</strong> Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/garmin-integration-is-rolling-out-for-oakley-meta-hstn-and-ray-ban-meta">bringing about several new features</a> like Garmin integration and additional recording options. Curiously enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/ai-glasses/1809764829519902/">the release notes</a> don't yet mention anything about adding new recording options, yet Android Central staff all seem to have them.</p><p>Central to the new options are a 60FPS recording, which launched on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> smart glasses in October, and a handful of video recording stability options. These stability options are even available on 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> glasses, giving users a free upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">one of the best features of newer Meta glasses</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwtY0iKr_tc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In the video above, I put the three new stability options side-by-side on the Ray-Ban Gen 1 glasses. Everything looks great, and even the "low" option offers significantly better stabilization than what was offered on the same glasses just last month. As you might expect, there's quite a bit of cropping that happens when using the higher stability options, which needs to be taken into account if you just want a wide-angle shot.</p><p>It's not until you compare it with the previous firmware that you really appreciate the new stability method, though. I switched the glasses back over to auto and took the same run I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> with, and the difference is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p><p>The new stability quality makes Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1's feel like a brand new pair of glasses, and the best part is that you don't have to change any settings at all. Auto is the default setting, and that's what was used to record that run in my video. It's unlikely we'll see 60FPS recording on Ray-Ban Gen 1's, but I'm not giving up hope for another free upgrade considering how great Meta has historically been about updating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> headsets in the past.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We just learned that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">push back the launch</a> of the Galaxy S26 series to February 2026 due to the late change of the Galaxy S26 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">replacing the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> in the lineup, and now there's another leak about the series, though this one might be a bummer for your wallet.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251104000392">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1985602011887518177">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>) reports that pricing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">Galaxy S26 series</a> could increase compared to the Galaxy S25 due to rising component costs. The report states that this price hike could come from the rising costs of many internal components all at once.</p><h2 id="price-hike-likely-coming-for-samsung-s-next-flagships-2">Price hike likely coming for Samsung's next flagships</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A report earlier this year cited that smartphone chipset prices have risen over 12% on average compared to last year, while camera module pricing is up nearly 8%. In addition, Mobile DRAM (LPDDR5) prices have increased nearly 16% compared to Q1 of this year due to limited supply. Adding to this, the smartphone tariff situation in the U.S. also remains uncertain.</p><p>All in all, this could mean Samsung might not be able to absorb the costs this time, resulting in higher prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> when it officially launches next year.</p><p>Samsung didn't raise prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> over the S24 lineup in January 2025. However, Samsung did increase the price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra by $100 when it launched in January 2024, so if pricing rises again, it would mark the second increase in three years.</p><p>Of course, nothing is set in stone yet, and a lot could change before the flagship smartphone series officially arrives, but it seems a price hike is on the cards. Still, Samsung may choose to swallow the extra costs, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">Pixel 10 series performing exceptionally well</a> in the States.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The most popular shape is a circular chip, featuring a hole or loop that allows for attachment to a key ring. Since they're so small and lightweight, you can even attach them to pet collars, though most brands don't advertise them as such for legal reasons.</p><p>Chipolo's keychain attachment is called the LOOP, whereas Pebblebee's take on it is called the Clip. They compete directly with the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024). I use all of these brands regularly and can say that their loudness levels are more or less the same, which is why I did not mention volume levels in my comparison.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo LOOP (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Clip Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Pro (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, replaceable CR2032 cell</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p> 40 x 57 x 8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>45 x 38 x 8.50 mm</p></td><td  ><p>59 x 34 x 7.7 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Chipolo LOOP has a superior IP rating compared to the Pebblebee Clip Universal, but it's also more expensive. Other than that, Pebblebee has the upper hand in this arena. Both charge via USB-C, but Chipolo lasts for six months on a single charge, whereas Pebblebee delivers twice as much — a whole year. Pebblebee also has a better Bluetooth range, 500 feet, as opposed to Chipolo's 400-foot range.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024) costs the same as Pebblebee's Clip and has the same range, but it has a far more heavy-duty IP68 water and dust-proof rating. Although the Tile Pro lasts for a year too, it doesn't recharge.

I interviewed the company's co-founder and CDO about this clever contraption in detail, which you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-magnetic-wireless-charging-bluetooth-trackers-interview"><strong>read here</strong></a> if you're interested.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo CARD (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Card Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Slim (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>350ft / 100m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via Qi wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>1.5 years, rechargeable via proprietary magnetic USB-C cable</p></td><td  ><p>3 years, non-replaceable</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>85.2 x 53.6 x 2.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>96 x 106 x 14 mm</p></td><td  ><p>85.4 x 53.9 x 2.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$29.98</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's so disappointing to see that Tile couldn't figure out a way to make its card-shaped tracker rechargeable. It'll need to be disposed of after three years, meaning you'll end up buying another one and spending far more money in the long run.</p><p>Pebblebee's Card is rechargeable, but you need to use a special magnetic charging cable with a Type-C port on one end. If you lose the cable, you're done for.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chipolo's pricier CARD recharges via any Qi, Qi2, or MagSafe wireless charger. It's awesome because it's so versatile and not proprietary, so you don't have to worry about losing the cable. Despite this, it's just as thin as the Tile Slim!</p><h2 id="google-fast-pair-makes-setting-up-instantaneous-2">Google Fast Pair makes setting up instantaneous</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-1" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-2" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Setting up the universal trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee is incredibly quick and easy, thanks to Google Fast Pair and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find Hub</a>. Before you have time to process what's happening, everything sets up. You don't even need the dedicated brands' apps on your phone. Both Chipolo and Pebblebee's universal trackers are added to the Google Find Hub, and you can manage them from there.</p><p>All three brands' trackers can be used as is without purchasing a monthly subscription; however, you may not be able to make the most of them at times. Life360 offers a free membership tier, but to enjoy the best features of your Tile tracker, such as live location sharing, you must be on a paid plan for $14.99/month or $24.99/month. Chipolo has no premium plans, but Pebblebee has an Alert Live subscription that costs just $2.99/month or $24.99/year for live GPS location updates and alerts.</p><p>If you're willing to pay a premium for more than just Bluetooth tracking, Pebblebee's plan is worth the splurge.</p><h2 id="which-bluetooth-tracker-should-you-opt-for-2">Which Bluetooth tracker should you opt for?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P" name="pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle" alt="Pebblebee's universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When buying a Bluetooth tracker intended for use on a keychain, I'd say it depends on where you live. If you're in a tropical region subject to constant rainfall, it's probably best to opt for something with robust waterproofing. This would give Tile by Life360 the edge over the rest, but the Tile Pro's replaceable cell is cumbersome.</p><p>I recommend getting the Pebblebee Clip Universal instead. It's the whole package for the cheapest price among the three. You get IPX6 water resistance, a USB-C cable for charging, and a year-long battery life. I myself use the Clip on my car key fob. Pebblebee includes a sturdy key ring, which is a nice bonus.</p><p>When it comes to wallet trackers, the Chipolo CARD is the reigning champion. Tile's entry doesn't even recharge; you'll have to toss it after three years, creating e-waste. Meanwhile, the Chipolo CARD recharges wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about having your proprietary cable around like the Pebblebee Card requires. For about $4 more, you get magnetic Qi wireless charging and a vastly superior IP rating, so it's the one you should pick.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b99dad04-3600-4d78-9708-9977216e0418">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STKPs5kn2E9McaYthR8mr3.jpg' alt="Chipolo CARD (2025) universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Chipolo CARD (2025)</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="100" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Recharge it wirelessly</strong></em></p><p>The Chipolo CARD has a 400ft Bluetooth range, uses magnetic Qi wireless charging, and features a robust IP65 rating.

They offer outstanding sound quality and superb active noise cancellation, but they've always come with a few qualifiers. They're the best <em>if</em> you happen to be deep into the Apple ecosystem. They're the best <em>if</em> they fit comfortably and securely in your ears.</p><p>Apple tried to address one of these pain points with the AirPods Pro 3, and you can probably guess which one. AirPods Pro 3 aren't any friendlier with Android or Windows devices, but they do have a refreshed design with new ear tips that claim to address comfort and fit for the masses. The earbuds borrow quite a bit from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, including the insertion angle and heart-rate monitor for workout tracking.</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are said to have "the world's best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones," along with improved sound quality. After a month of testing, I can say that's probably true. However, as someone who has struggled with comfort on the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2, I'm disappointed to report that the AirPods Pro 3 aren't much better.</p><p>Testing AirPods Pro 3 with an unforgiving ear shape reminded me that standout ANC or sound quality can't compensate for weak fundamentals, such as fit. For those who find the AirPods Pro 3 comfortable and secure, these are the best-in-class earbuds.

This allows the sound to go straight into your ear canal for better quality and volume. The redesigned earbuds, packing vents that control airflow, help create a better spatial feel and improved sound quality across the board.</p><p>AirPods Pro 3 appear to use the exact same drivers as their predecessor, which Apple calls a "custom high-excursion driver." The earbuds are also powered by the same chip, the Apple H2. It may be hard to believe, but the AirPods Pro 3 really do sound better, largely due to the redesigned "multiport acoustic architecture" and fresh tuning.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-3" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can see the AirPods Pro 3 vents that help create what Apple calls a "multiport acoustic architecture." </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple uses an "Adaptive EQ" to set the sound signature for AirPods, and it isn't customizable like most earbuds. This time, the AirPods Pro 3 feature much deeper and stronger low-end frequencies with bright highs. Apple says its new Adaptive EQ "transforms the bass response" and "brings vivid vocal clarity to higher frequencies," which is readily apparent even to casual listeners when playing music with AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>I don't mind the new sound signature, although a common criticism with this style of tuning is that mids are occasionally lost through overemphasizing the lows and highs. In this case, I find that AirPods Pro 3 are exciting to listen to, even if they aren't the most balanced earbuds on the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-13" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Songs that already have a good amount of bass, like Raekwon's "Guillotine," are reproduced well without an overwhelming feel. The bass-centric audio profile seems to affect tracks that lie in the middle, such as Alessia Cara's "Slow Motion," a pop piece with a groovy baseline that AirPods Pro 3 turn into a focal point. It's also not rare to see the earbuds highlight sounds at the high end of the spectrum, which I heard from the hi-hat and ride cymbal in Supertramp's soft rock title "Oh Darling."</p><p>The problem is that, because Apple presets Adaptive EQ and you can't adjust it yourself, listeners will have no recourse if they hate it. I'm sure there are some people who will prefer the AirPods Pro 2's sound signature over the new one, and it's a shame custom EQ support isn't here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-5" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Active noise-canceling is also improved, with Apple claiming it's up to two times better than the AirPods Pro 2 and up to four times better than the AirPods Pro 3.

That said, I can use the AirPods Pro 3 on a plane in a pinch, which I haven't been able to say about other in-ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-15" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth giving Apple a tip of the cap for all the software features it added to AirPods Pro 3.

Best of all, Apple tends to upgrade AirPods over time and release software updates regularly — many of these features are also coming to AirPods Pro 2 owners for free.</p><p>As an added bonus, AirPods Pro 3 have an optical heart rate sensor for light workout tracking.

The hybrid ear tips, which feature a silicone exterior for flexibility and sweatproofing plus a foam interior that expands to fill your ear canal when inserted, work as expected. The AirPods Pro 3 are the most secure pair of AirPods I've used, and they stayed in place during a 5K run, requiring only a handful of adjustments throughout.</p><p>While they are secure, I don't find them very comfortable. To get a great seal (necessary for ANC) and a fit that won't slip out of your ears, you might need to use an ear tip size larger than you'd typically find comfortable. If you go smaller, comfort might be improved, but fitment and seal suffer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-8" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I struggled with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 fit, too, but I prefer the older models.

There are camps that find AirPods Pro 3 better, worse, and the same in terms of fit. It's unfortunate that there is a strong possibility AirPods Pro 2 owners will upgrade only to find their fit isn't as good. The only way to find out for sure is to try them in your ears firsthand.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-airpods-pro-3-competition"><span>AirPods Pro 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-10" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most, the AirPods Pro 3 will be competing with the AirPods Pro 2. The jump from AirPods Pro to AirPods Pro 2 was quite significant, but the one to AirPods Pro 3 is more modest. Apple claims the new earbuds are up to twice as effective in certain situations, which is likely due to the switch to foam ear tips for improved passive isolation, rather than a technological overhaul. The big reason to upgrade will be the redesigned earbuds, which might fit better or worse, depending on your ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2446px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-Pro-open-lids" alt="Pixel Buds Pro 2 vs Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2446" height="1376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users will be trying to decide whether AirPods Pro 3 are better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>.</p><p>The truth is, each pair first-party earbuds have their own advantages, and you should probably pick the ones that match your phone.

Most AR glasses feel like strapping a paperweight to your skull. Lenovo is betting that its new solution isn't a more powerful chip or a brighter display, but a radical focus on shedding weight.</p><p>Lenovo rolled out the AI Glasses V1 in China with a price tag of CNY 3,999 (about $562) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1050763.html" target="_blank">preorders</a> now open, with sales set to begin around November 9 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-displace-the-Rokid-Glasses-as-the-lightest-AI-AR-glasses.1152389.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). The company is positioning them as a productivity-friendly wearable rather than purely a gimmick.</p><p>The build is the first thing you’ll notice: the glasses weigh just 38 grams, making them lighter than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">leading smart glasses</a>. The lenses are only 1.8 mm thick, and Lenovo uses a resin diffraction waveguide display with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p><p>It supports a 15 × 11 mm eye-box designed to maintain stable visuals even if your head moves slightly. You also get the choice to switch between monocular or binocular display modes depending on how you wear them.</p><h2 id="built-for-productivity-ai-2">Built for productivity AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF" name="Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-on-face" alt="Lenovo AI Glasses V1 worn on face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the software and features side: the glasses are powered by Lenovo’s own Tianxi AI assistant, which handles voice commands, real-time translation (voice and on-screen text) and information search. For productivity and creators, there’s a teleprompter mode (when paired with Lenovo’s smart ring accessory you can scroll slides or prompts without looking away).</p><p>Audio and input are covered by stereo speakers built into the frame’s temples and dual microphones, and connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.4. However, some advanced features, like the navigation overlays, are currently limited to Android smartphones only.</p><p>Battery wise, Lenovo claims up to 10 hours of use in translation mode, around 4 hours in teleprompter mode, and a standby time of up to 250 hours. Charging is fast, taking about 40 minutes for a full charge.</p><p>On the flip side, to hit that ultra-lightness, Lenovo trimmed a few things: there’s no built-in camera (which some competing wearables do offer) and the battery is smaller compared to higher-profile AR headsets.</p><p>If you’re into wearable tech and like the idea of glasses that do more than sit there, the AI Glasses V1 are definitely worth watching. That said, you’ll want to wait and see how they feel in the real world and whether Lenovo brings a version for international markets and different languages.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> released, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">AYN Thor</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">AYANEO Pocket DS</a> were introduced. Now, Anbernic is joining in on the fun with the Anbernic RG DS.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEyUWDzoqq0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>At first glance, the RG DS looks almost identical to the original Nintendo DS Lite, as it's even available in a couple of the same colorways. However, no matter how hard you look for one, you won't actually be able to use those original DS cartridges. Obviously, that's not really the point, as you can download those games to your computer, transfer them to a microSD card, then put that in the RG DS.</p><p>The RG DS is equipped with dual touchscreen displays, with both the top and bottom screens measuring in at 4-inches, and coming with a 640 x 480 resolution. These are both larger than the original Nintendo DS, DS Lite, or DSi handhelds, and just a smidge smaller than the DSi XL (4.2-inches.)</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Anbernic RG DS</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Top Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Bottom Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>RockChip RK3568</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>GPU</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Mali G52-2EE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>32GB + microSD (up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh (~6 hours)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Extras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Hall Magnetic Switch for Sleep Mode, Six-axis Gyro, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Software</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p></td><td  ><p>160 x 91 x 21.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>321g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Black & Crimson Red / Turquoise Blue / Polar White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Obviously the big benefit here is that unlike the original hardware, Anbernic's RG DS is running Android. This means that you're not limited to just playing DS or DSi games, and have access to so much more. That said, we'd recommend tempering your expectations, as you'll likely start running into problems if you venture into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-your-galaxy-z-fold-3-nintendo-ds">3DS library of games</a>.</p><p>This is because Anbernic opted to rely on the RockChip RK3568, the first time we're seeing this chip in a gaming handheld. It's using practically the same CPU as the RK3566 found in the Anbernic RG353V, but with a slightly more powerful GPU.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVAHh-DmDu8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're curious as to why we don't have something like the Unisoc T820 from the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernics-next-gaming-handheld-strikes-a-nice-balance-between-budget-and-flagship">RG476H</a>, it's for good reason. Instead of trying to shoot for the moon, Anbernic went the opposite route, and managed to price this dual-screen Android-powered handheld at under $100.</p><p>Pre-orders are now open for the RG DS, and you can get one for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds">$93.99 from Anbernic</a> directly, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html">$96.99 at AliExpress</a> (with code USCD12). Anbernic says it plans to ship RG DS pre-orders "before December 15," which leads us to believe it might begin arriving sooner rather than later. And when that happens, the pre-order discounts will vanish, with the $99.99 retail price taking its place.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo" name="anbernic-rg-ds-square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG DS:</strong> <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$99.99</del> <strong>$93.99 at Anbernic</strong></a></p><p>Dreams of an Android powered Nintendo DS have been realized, and now, the Anbernic RG DS is on the way with a price that's pretty darn insane. </p><p><strong>Price check:</strong> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html"><del>$108.99</del> <strong>$96.99 at AliExpress w/ code USCD12</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

The company promoted it as for developer and research use, not for public Q&A.</p><p>But someone asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Gemma</a> a factual question: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” According to her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/5651166C-7B30-4BA0-9E86-F3DD9521CA00" target="_blank">letter</a> to CEO Sundar Pichai, Gemma answered with a wild, made-up claim: that Blackburn had pressured a state trooper for prescription drugs during her campaign, alleged non-consensual acts, and provided “news” links that turned out to be broken or unrelated (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/google-pulls-gemma-from-ai-studio-after-senator-blackburn-accuses-model-of-defamation/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Blackburn called it “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but an act of defamation.</p><p>Google responded by removing Gemma from AI Studio access (for non-developers) and reaffirmed that Gemma remains accessible only via API for developers. The tech giant stressed the model was never meant to be used as a consumer-facing Q&A tool.</p><h2 id="ai-hallucinations-strike-again-2">AI hallucinations strike again</h2><p>The incident reignites the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">broader concern about AI hallucinations</a> — when a model confidently spits out false info as fact.

These phones will be available before the end of the year and cost less than $200, making them likely choices for anyone in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, especially as we approach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 are very similar phones, both in terms of design and specs. As for what's the same, they both feature 6.7-inch 120Hz LCD panels and Motorola's more recent design language, which resembles many of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">the company's latest phones</a>. They even share the same dimensions and weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU" name="Moto-G-2026-colors" alt="Moto G 2026 colors next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G 2026 in both Panton colors. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>They're powered by the MediaTek 6300, a decent mid-range chip that should be able to handle daily use just fine, even with 4GB of RAM (which can be expanded to 12GB via RAM Boost). It's actually a big deal for the Moto G Play 2026, as it's the first time a Play model will come with 5G connectivity. It's the same chip powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, so hopefully that translates to a better experience than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review">the last Play model we reviewed</a>.</p><p>There's also a slight bump in battery capacity, which is now 5,200mAh. Motorola promises up to two days of battery life, which is certainly a draw.</p><p>Finally, both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box, with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.

Firstly, the camera system is likely a bit better on the former, as the Moto  G 2026 sports a 50MP primary camera, while the Play makes do with a 32MP sensor. Other sensors are essentially auxiliary (macro, ambient light) and likely serve only to give the phones the appearance of having more robust camera systems than they actually do, but Motorola promises "stunning results" with the AI-powered cameras.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 also has double the storage at 128GB and supports faster charging, 30W wired versus 18W on the Moto G Play 2026.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3106px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT" name="Moto-G-2026-lifestyle-1-Pantone-Cattleya-Orchid" alt="Moto G 2026 on a table next to a cup of coffee" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxLdwrSRptfHVF8ueUEZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3106" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G 2026. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the Moto G 2026 will be available in two Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid, the latter of which is a very vibrant purple-like hue. The Moto G Play is only available in Pantone Tapestry, which is a rather muted blue. As is the norm with Motorola phones, you can expect faux leather to cover the rear, while Gorilla Glass 3 protects the front.</p><h2 id="in-time-for-the-holidays-2">In time for the holidays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D" name="Moto-G-Play-lifestyle-2-pantone-tapestry" alt="A man using a Moto G Play 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsEuZLHJKzs7inoNiZ4f5D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4599" height="2587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Play 2026 is the cheapest model of the two and will be available first.

The report even notes this as a "single-month sales record for the OEM."</p><p>Pixel sales in the U.S. have also been growing steadily over the past few years.

These thermostats will no longer be supported with software updates, and remote control access has been removed. They'll still function as physical thermostats, but all the Nest cloud features that made them special are gone.</p><p>To soften the blow, Google offered owners of affected Nest Learning Thermostats $130 off the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">a new fourth-generation model</a>. For many, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">that wasn't enough</a>. There's a free and open-source project that aims to keep older Nest Learning Thermostats up and running, and it may be the lifeline fans were hoping for.</p><p>It's called the "NoLongerEvil Thermostat" on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and it's the creation of developer Cody Kociemba (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/03/google-nest-thermostat-old-revive-project/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The project allows savvy users to flash a modified bootloader and kernel components onto their Nest Learning Thermostat, redirecting network traffic from Google's server to its own NoLongerEvil website. It was developed by reverse-engineering the Nest API.</p><p>"By intercepting the communication layer, the thermostat believes it's communicating with the official Nest infrastructure, but instead connects to the NoLongerEvil platform," the GitHub page explains. "This approach ensures full compatibility with the device's existing software while breaking free from Google's cloud dependency."</p><p>Notably, this is still an experimental project and is currently in the testing phase. The project's developers warn that users should not try the firmware on any thermostat that is crucial for heating and cooling. "Only proceed if you have a backup thermostat or can afford to have your device non-functional during testing," the page cautions.</p><h2 id="what-nolongerevil-thermostat-can-do-2">What NoLongerEvil Thermostat can do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.83%;"><img id="vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9" name="No-Longer-Evil-Website" alt="The NoLongerEvil website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2420" height="1714" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NoLongerEvil)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This project will soon be fully open-sourced, but you can get started testing it now. The website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nolongerevil.com" target="_blank">nolongerevil.com</a> brings back support for setting temperatures and modes remotely, plus viewing the status of your thermostat. It's designed to be installed as a progressive web app (PWA) on mobile devices, so it'll work on everything from Android phones to PCs.</p><p>While the process requires a bit of know-how, like entering DFU mode on your thermostat and flashing new software, it does restore the functionality Google removed last month. When it's widely available as open-source software, this project will serve as a baseline for tinkerers to regain control of their unsupported Nest thermostats.</p><p>"Fork the code, modify it, break it, rebuild it, share it," the project's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nolongerevil.com/about" target="_blank">about page</a> states.

If it happens, you might one day use Google Photos not only to revisit memories but also to restyle yourself—uploading outfit photos, comparing looks, and generating new combinations based on your existing wardrobe.</p><p>It’s not confirmed yet, but it hints at how Google is quietly turning Photos into something that feels more like a personal visual assistant.</p><p>At the moment, Ask Photos itself is still limited. The feature is currently available only in the United States and can be accessed via a separate Ask tab in the Photos app for users who meet the eligibility requirements.</p><p>The dedicated shortcut button discovered in the teardown hasn’t been officially announced, meaning it might take a while before users outside the U.S. see it. Likewise, the Outfits collection and Doppl integration are speculative for now, since early code references don’t always translate into a public rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's also likely that this language expansion opened up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/5-best-ai-features-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7#:~:text=the%20Edge%20Panel.-,Call%20Assist,-There%27s%20one%20AI">Call Assist</a>, too.</p><p>With that, users can screen calls and see a transcription of what the person (or bot) on the other side is saying. Live Translate comes into play, translating the text to your preferred language. Galaxy AI's language expansion is making its rounds globally to users looking for it. Samsung says Gujarati and Filipino will appear as a language pack for Galaxy AI in your Settings app.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-for-all-2">Galaxy AI for all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:585px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="p8jCZ99fsjaaXvokqZTuwA" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-language-expansion-22-supported" alt="Galaxy AI now supports 22 languages for even more global support." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8jCZ99fsjaaXvokqZTuwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="585" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of Galaxy AI, an update earlier this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-update-brings-gemini-live-capabilities-to-samsung-galaxy-s25-users">brought Gemini Live</a> to the Galaxy S25 series. That update made it possible for the latest flagship phone owners to lean on Google's AI for visual assistance. In real-time, users can converse with Gemini and see their questions answered on the fly, as they move from subject to subject. Moreover, users can now trigger the AI's Live mode by pressing and holding their side button.</p><p>Also, as a bit of good news for Galaxy phone owners, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-phone-users-rejoice-as-your-galaxy-ai-features-are-likely-staying-free">confirmed this summer</a> that its default features will remain free. This promise lumps in Live Translate, Note Assist, and several more. You might remember that there were rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-plans-to-charge-for-certain-galaxy-ai-features-after-two-years">was looking to charge for its Galaxy AI features</a> in two years (the original report was from 2024). Now, the company's walked back on that, doing something that Google has opted not to do, as it's deployed a few AI subscriptions already.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Gurman reports the new Siri rollout is roughly tabbed for March 2026, and could launch with iOS 26.4 next spring. However, the collaboration between Google and Apple is said to be much different from its arrangement with OpenAI for ChatGPT integration.</p><p>Bloomberg reaffirms that custom Google Gemini models are planned to run on Apple's own Private Cloud Compute servers. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> integration, Apple will securely control user data and complete requests on its PCC hardware and software, which is publicly made available for peer security reviews. By comparison, when iPhone users tap into Apple Intelligence's ChatGPT integration, they are opting-into OpenAI's data sharing policies.</p><p>The custom Gemini models will reportedly serve as a planner and summarizer, powering two out of three main components of the upcoming Siri revamp. The third, a knowledge search system, could also use Gemini models, but that is not confirmed.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Speaking of Apple and AI. The new Siri is planned for March give-or-take, as has been the case for months. Apple has been saying for 9 months it’s coming in 2026. Apple simply reiterated that on the earnings call. Nothing new but for some reason sparked headlines. https://t.co/eQm14rGB9E<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1985374715977089078">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Gurman noted in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) that the report is "nothing new," but at the very least, it is a confirmation that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple's release schedule is still on track for 2026</a>. Apple confirmed as much on its most recent earnings call. However, Apple's Siri redesign was first announced more than a year ago and faced numerous delays. It was initially marketed as an iPhone 16 series feature to debut with iOS.</p><p>Since then, iOS users flocked to Google AI products, with Gemini becoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">the top free app for iPhone</a> in September 2025.</p><p>The delays were major enough that the iPhone 16 has been replaced with the iPhone 17, and yet the new Siri is still nowhere to be found. Apple was forced to walk back its iPhone 16 claims about Siri in March 2025 by adding a disclaimer to iPhone and Apple Intelligence product pages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/apple-website-siri-features-fine-print/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>). So, the comments from Apple and Gurman's latest report do hold weight as evidence that the Siri upgrade is still penned  for early next year.</p><h2 id="why-apple-wants-gemini-2">Why Apple wants Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8" name="Apple-Intelligence-vs-Gemini" alt="The Apple Intelligence & Siri menu beside a Pixel running Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's in-house large language models (LLM) and foundational models are seen as lacking compared to the competition.

That's not the only major event coverage YouTube TV users will go without if the two companies can't come to an agreement. Election Day in the U.S. is today, Nov. 4, and Disney is requesting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> restore access to ABC — one of the four major news networks — for one day only as a result.</p><p>Google denied that request with a public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/" target="_blank">statement</a>, also sent to Disney leadership, that serves as a counteroffer. The company says Disney's proposal would "cause customer confusion" by having ABC return for a day and the channel disappearing immediately after. Instead, Google is proposing that Disney restore both ABC and ESPN indefinitely on YouTube TV while the two sides negotiate.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Need a good alternative to YouTube TV?</strong></em><strong> </strong><br><a href="https://www.hulu.com/start/affiliate-livetv"><strong>Hulu + Live TV Bundle: </strong><del>$89.99/mo</del><strong> $64.99/mo for first three months</strong></a></li></ul><p>"There are plenty of other options for customers — election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free," Google's statement reads. "In fact, on the last two U.S. election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC."</p><p>Google's email emphasizes that it could restore ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV "in hours" if Disney agrees to the proposal, just in time for Election Day coverage. It also claims that ABC could alternatively livestream its coverage for free on YouTube.</p><div><blockquote><p>Publicly resorting to the same tactic that Disney relied on in past disputes fails to acknowledge the distinction between YouTube and other distribution platforms.

In a statement to Deadline, Disney explained its position on the matter, saying it wants to put the negotiations aside for a day for the sake of public interest.</p><p>"Despite the impasse that led to the current blackout, we have asked YouTube TV to restore ABC for Election Day so subscribers have access to the information they rely on," a Disney spokesperson said in the statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-youtube-tv-blackout-abc-election-day-1236605420/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>.

I got this charger the other day and was pleased to find out that it works with both Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Compatible-Headliner-Accessories-Indicator/dp/B0FL7HQVRB/"><strong>now it's on sale for a few bucks off at Amazon, making it just over $30.</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Why get a charging dock when the glasses already have a charging case? The answer is so that you never run into a situation where both your glasses and the charging case run out of battery. This ingenious little dock makes it simple to drop your glasses and the case on the dock the moment you walk in your front door and then pick them up again from a convenient location on your way out.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5da4497e-70d2-49c3-b7cc-e58aa13fe4e5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Celebrate the launch of the AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock with a 10% off coupon on Amazon!

I found that the charger is a few minutes faster to hit both 50% and 100% charge for each the glasses and the case. That means if your glasses end up with a dead battery when you walk in the door it only takes 17 minutes to hit a 50% charge. That's just enough to last for quite some time if you find yourself out and about for a few hours and still want to carry your glasses with you.</p><p>The front of the dock has a nose piece clip that looks essentially identical to what you'll find inside of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses charging case. The glasses click nicely into place and a charging LED on the front of the dock lets you know that your glasses are charging by turning from green to red. Once the glasses are all charged up, that same LED will turn green. There's a second LED next to it to show the status of the charging case and each of these LEDs has a handy symbol above it so that you never are guessing which LED goes to which device</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7aX8553hiyEQTpZunVbJAD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-back-with-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aX8553hiyEQTpZunVbJAD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gNX4jC59SHyXWWC5NwGa9D" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-magnetic-connector-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNX4jC59SHyXWWC5NwGa9D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wVpniuZjvaEJsAEeLZ5BCD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-magnetic-connector-case-02" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVpniuZjvaEJsAEeLZ5BCD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U6n8zyqKy2h6KVxT8Yiw3D" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-pins-for-case" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6n8zyqKy2h6KVxT8Yiw3D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LTf4FKrpwYvh9Uut75Z2DD" name="amvr-ray-ban-meta-charger-pins" alt="The AMVR Ray-Ban Meta charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTf4FKrpwYvh9Uut75Z2DD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Popping the charging case into the dock is just as simple thanks to a clever magnetic USB-C connector that ships in the box. AMVR even includes a second one of these in the box just in case you lose the first one, which is always a possibility given how small these little dongles are. I've used these kinds of magnetic charging docks with my Meta Quest in the past and it's amazing how handy it is to just be able to drop the case on the dock and have it charge. It's like a wireless charging magnetic connector for your phone except in this case it's purpose built for the Ray-Ban Meta charging case.</p><p>Well this one does work with all generations of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, it doesn't work with Oakley Meta smart glasses or the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses. Those cases are not the right size and shape and they simply won't fit on the dock, although they will charge Oakley Meta HSTN glasses if you happen to have a pair of those. Just not the large charging case that comes with those glasses.</p><p>There aren't too many accessories for the smart glasses just yet but clever manufacturers like AMVR well no doubt come up with more ideas as we get more of these products. AMVR in particular makes some of my favorite Meta Quest accessories and I have no doubt that they will continue to talk the list of Ray-Ban Meta accessories as time passes.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><u><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><u><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><u><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><u><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

To recap, the present issue regards the in-call button within the Phone app on the previously mentioned Pixel phones. Users reported over the summer with the Pixel 10 that the button is "unresponsive" and, at other times, "laggy."</p><p>It's been incredibly frustrating for users who purchased the recent Pixel 10 series to have to repeatedly tap the speaker button to get it to work (and in other cases, it doesn't). Unfortunately, users were reporting this back in May with the Pixel 9 series, too.</p><p>Users have taken to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/441823037?pli=1#comment8">Issue Tracker</a> to voice their displeasure with the problem and to provide the necessary material to help the company fix it. This thread was made back in August, and Google continued to return to it for two months, until just recently, when not "enough actionable information" was given. Users quickly chirped back today (Nov 3), stating the "severe latency" with the speakerphone is unacceptable. They've highlighted reports on online forums, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n3gkt0/pixel_10_pro_xl_during_a_full_screen_call/">reports from Reddit</a>, which PunikaWeb brings up.</p><p>Another user with a Pixel 9 says they experience this problem within the Phone app without fail. According to the publication, there is one workaround: tap the speakerphone in the notification, not through the in-call screen.</p><h2 id="problems-aplenty-2">Problems aplenty</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roEZdZhdjkhBBc2v3GQXxV" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-jade-03" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roEZdZhdjkhBBc2v3GQXxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This speakerphone problem isn't the only one Pixel 10 users have had to deal with, as reports in October <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-camera-gets-the-shakes-in-user-bug-reports">highlighted its shaky camera</a>. The Pixel 10 Pro's cameras got the shakes last month, with user reports stating its EIS (electronic image stabilization) was having issues within the API. As a result, filming with the Pixel 10 Pro often delivered a shaky, often slightly blurry result.</p><p>EIS is meant to smooth out those micromovements we have when holding things (we're human, you know?), but that's not happening correctly. The issues were extremely noticeable when using 5x zoom, and even still with 2x.</p><p>There's hope that Google is working on a fix for this for the November security patch, but there's nothing confirmed. Elsewhere, Pixel users reported that their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-random-app-crashes-oct-2025">apps were crashing</a> following the October patch. Speculation said there was a conflict between Google Play Services and last month's patch. The only "fix" users reported was to uninstall the then-latest Play Services and Play Store updates. Just like the other problem, we're holding out hope for a fix in November.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, this is in regard to the "economics" of pay-TV, per an executive the post cites. The exec told Deadline in a statement that, regarding Disney, "There are aspects of their portfolio that are doing well on our platform." However, everything isn't so clean cut, as they add that their "broad portfolio" may contain channels where viewership may "decline" or become "non-existent."</p><p>It's because of this thinking that the exec reportedly informed the publication that Disney was expecting "steep carriage fees," despite its viewership dropping a bit in recent years. Disney has also reportedly dismissed this statement, saying that it's actually tried to offer services that "lower" costs for the consumer.</p><p>Apparently, there were some rumors about Disney potentially using its acquisition of Fubo, as well as Hulu Live, as "leverage" for its current negotiations with YouTube TV. A Disney executive reportedly cut down that theory, stating YouTube TV was “intentionally misrepresenting the situation."</p><p>From the recent reports, it seems clear that consumers are going to have to continue waiting for a YouTube TV, Disney agreement. Even the fate of ESPN on the platform is in the air, which doesn't bode well for sports lovers.</p><h2 id="no-middle-ground-disney-s-channels-disappear-2">No middle ground, Disney's channels disappear</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mnZtoLc7iBLt5e3Ugx56hQ" name="disney-plus-logo-169.png" alt="Disney+ logo with blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnZtoLc7iBLt5e3Ugx56hQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1119" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central has reached out to YouTube TV and Disney about the latest stalemate report and will update this post if we hear back.</p><p>Last week, we were rapidly approaching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">the deadline for a content deal</a> between YouTube TV and Disney. The former claimed it had entered negotiations with the latter in order to keep channels like ABC and ESPN for its subscribers. However, similar to what we've heard today in the recent report, YouTube TV claimed Disney's proposals would've led to a price hike for viewers.</p><p>Still, Disney pointed the blame at YouTube TV, stating it was "exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers."</p><p>Both sides had until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to reach some sort of middle ground, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disney-channels-disappear-from-youtube-tv-as-the-sides-fail-to-reach-deal">but that didn't happen</a>. With the contract up, viewers lost 21 channels, including ABC and ESPN. YouTube TV and Disney delivered their own statements, each defending their stances, which only lengthens this blackout for consumers. According to Disney, "Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor."</p><p>It's a similar sentiment we've heard Deadline report from a Disney exec.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Like the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, the XL also now supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a>, and the phone's battery life is better than ever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uZa7fAnCBYDpUsbrVwzEzU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-02" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL basking in the sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZa7fAnCBYDpUsbrVwzEzU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other end of things, the Google Pixel 10 series does still lag behind certain Android phones when it comes to gaming performance and max processing speeds, and some folks aren't going to be happy about the Pixel 10 being restricted to eSIM-only in the United States. </p><p>Moreover, this Mint Mobile deal only really works if you're cool committing to the T-Mobile-owned carrier for a full year. I, for one, have no problem using the popular MVNO for twelve months if it means I can score 50% off the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

You get unlimited talk, text, and data powered by the world's largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and unlimited calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK.

Google is rolling out enhanced autofill for Chrome starting today, Nov. 3, and it bolsters Chrome's capabilities. The feature saves more information from data fields in common forms, like a driver's license number, passport number, or vehicle information.</p><p>For people who hate pulling out their driver's license to find their ID number or the walk to the car to check their license plate again, enhanced autofill in Chrome is there. The feature is available for certain forms and supports storing driver's license and passport numbers as well as vehicle license plate numbers and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). When you enter these fields for the first time, a prompt will appear offering to save that information with enhanced autofill in Chrome.</p><p>"If you choose to turn on enhanced autofill, Chrome understands forms better and can autofill the fields faster for you," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893" target="_blank">support document</a> explains. "This autofill feature can offer to save info when you submit forms, like your driver’s license, passport, or vehicle info."</p><p>Enhanced autofill is turned off in Chrome by default. To enable it, you'll need to click the three-dot menu in the browser on a computer and navigate to <strong>Settings > Autofill and passwords</strong>. From there, users can click <strong>Enhanced autofill</strong> and flip the toggle beside it to turn it on.</p><p>Google says this feature is designed to be "private and secure," and that user data is encrypted. Prompts offering to save supported data kinds will only appear after you've manually flipped the toggle, and you'll still need to confirm again before it is finally added to enhanced autofill.</p><p>The company adds that site URLs and content may be shared with Google when you visit a site with a form and enhanced autofill is enabled. The information is used "to provide you with better autofill suggestions and improve enhanced autofill."</p><h2 id="see-enhanced-autofill-in-chrome-in-action-2">See enhanced autofill in Chrome in action</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nqembxZetwDrmu9cHrPbsA" name="Enhanced-Autofill-Chrome-2" alt="Enhanced autofill in Chrome autofilling driver's license info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nqembxZetwDrmu9cHrPbsA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users who want to try enhanced autofill in Chrome can wait to encounter a supported form or manually enter it.

The two companies failed to reach an agreement last month, which led to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning"><u>Disney pulling its channels</u></a>, including ABC, ESPN, FX, and National Geographic, from YouTube TV starting October 30, 2025.</p><p>While no new agreement has been reached and the channels remain unavailable, Google is compensating users with monthly credits.

If the credit is available and accepted, YouTube TV will apply $10 monthly credits to your account for the next six months before your plan returns to its regular price.</p><p>That said, it’s still not much considering the loss of 20 channels. Even though $60 over six months sounds decent, it doesn’t fully offset the value lost, nor is it the $20 credit Google initially promised, which now seems delayed for an “extended period of time."</p><p>This isn’t the first time YouTube TV has faced such issues. Earlier this year, the service also struggled to reach a deal with Paramount, which provided 34 channels. At that time, YouTube offered $8 credits, while this time it’s giving $10.</p><p>The dispute continues as Disney claims YouTube TV refuses to pay fair rates for its channels, while YouTube TV accuses Disney of demanding terms that would unfairly raise prices for subscribers and favor Disney's own Live TV + Hulu competing service.</p> ]]></dc:content>
