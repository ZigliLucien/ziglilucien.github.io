Users can now find "most popular content" in specific categories on the new YouTube Charts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM" name="YouTube-Music-Podcasts.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Podcast filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3744" height="2106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up until now, and ever since Google launched the Trending page back in 2015, viewers would find what was actually trending — a singular list of viral videos. However, the company notes that it is supposedly changing and users are said to be learning about trends through their recommendations, search suggestions, comments, and communities, rather than the Trending page or Trending Now list. And, this seemed to be the case for the last five years.</p><p>"So, we're making updates to better match how people discover trending content today by shifting away from one all-encompassing Trending list towards category-specific charts that we’ll continue to invest in over time," the YouTube team stated in the aforementioned post.</p><p>So, technically, instead of finding all types of content in a single Trending page, YouTube is diversifying through a new Charts feature. It means users will be able to explore charts for "Trending Music Videos, Weekly Top Podcast Shows, and Trending Movie Trailers."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.72%;"><img id="EHZ7QTjUfaMYrNLuBK7Vm5" name="New-YouTube-Charts-2025" alt="New YouTube Charts 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EHZ7QTjUfaMYrNLuBK7Vm5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="927" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:747px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.32%;"><img id="GgXeRVoicHmpWLnwYKrUj5" name="New-YouTube-Charts-2025" alt="New YouTube Charts 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgXeRVoicHmpWLnwYKrUj5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="747" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.72%;"><img id="RyEFsTYzc5eNQNBBVuqWj5" name="New-YouTube-Charts-2025" alt="New YouTube Charts 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyEFsTYzc5eNQNBBVuqWj5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="927" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The streaming platform is further assuring that more content categories to charts will be added over time.

Additionally, the "Inspiration" tab in YouTube Studio claims to give creators personalized ideas to help spot the "next big thing" for their channel.</p><p>And, to help the creators get their content a boost and get discovered, YouTube's Hype feature comes into play. It is believed to let viewers "amplify fresh videos they love." Also, artists on the rise will have a dedicated spot on the "Music Explore page."</p><p>As mentioned, all these new YouTube Charts and features are supposedly taking effect in the coming weeks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you've found yourself in this situation more than once, I recommend picking up a pair of CMF Buds 2a from Amazon, as these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7"><strong>normally run $50 but are down to just $28</strong></a> for the final day of the 4-day Prime Day event. That sale ends today, Friday, July 11.</p><p>If you're not a fan of the overtly <em>radical</em> orange color I'm wearing in the picture above, don't worry. CMF sells these in black or white colorways, and they're the same price as the orange ones.</p><p>CMF Buds 2a are from the Nothing brand, a UK company that sells design-forward products, normally at incredibly reasonable prices. These are already our favorite budget earbuds under $50, and this ridiculous Prime Day deal makes them a perfect impulse buy choice.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9" name="CMF-Buds-2a" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>CMF Buds 2a 🎧</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$49.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/"><strong>$28 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CMF-Buds-2a-Wireless-Earbuds-Bluetooth-5-4-IP54-42-dB-ANC-12-4mm-Dynamic-Driver-for-Big-Bass-Up-to-35-5-Hours-of-Battery-Life-Orange/16550373168"><strong>$28 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>"Honestly, the Buds 2 by itself is a fabulous choice considering it doesn't miss out on much. The buds have a glossy finish around the shell and a matte stalk, and the gesture recognition surface is decent enough.

Don't let that make you think they're <em>garbage</em>, though. They're not.

That case also has a wonderful fidget spinner wheel on the side that doubles as a lanyard holder, so you can keep it laced up in your pocket or bag so the case never falls out.</p><p>The buds themselves are super lightweight and comfortable, with different eartip sizes in the box and a design that looks as good as it feels.</p><p>If you're in the market for spending just a tad more, I recommend trying out CMF Buds Pro 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D81S532L"><strong>at just $47 today</strong></a>. They upgrade the audio quality and turn that little fidget wheel into a volume rocker, complete with a customizable button and tons of enhanced ANC support. They're my personal favorite, and that little wheel and the sound quality bump is enough for me to recommend them over anything else because of the crazy good price.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

They're also <em>ultra-easy to clean</em>, so you can share your headset with someone else without needing to put it in a hazmat bag afterwards. Just remove the pad with the velcro backing, clean it with a cloth and a gentle cleaning agent, and it's good as new!</p><p>As a bonus, the plastic piece that snaps into the Meta Quest 3 itself has four ventilation holes on it that not only pull out all the face humidity to keep the lenses from fogging up all the time, but it also helps keep your face cool and somehow magically blocks out light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-and-quest-3s-controller-upgrades-prime-day-2025"><strong>Meta Quest controller upgrades for under $20 on Prime Day</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4896e2e6-6d36-49da-8205-df7056c8ee41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get sweet relief for your sweating face with this Kiwi Design facial interface replacement for the Meta Quest 3.

This whopping $140 discount on the stylus-bearing 10.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a> e-reader is an incredible offer. It won't last forever, though. You only have today to take advantage of it, should you choose to.</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox/dont-buy-a-kindle-this-prime-day-get-an-onyx-boox-instead">Onyx Boox e-paper tablets are superior</a> and come with unrestricted Android installed, they are also pretty darn expensive. If you don't need anything more than a high-quality E Ink display for reading and writing on, then the Kindle Scribe will serve you perfectly well. This deal includes the Premium Pen, increasing the value prospect even more.</p><p>This epic Prime Day drives down this e-reader's unjustifiable $420 going rate to a wonderfully affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6"><strong>$280 on Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>You only have until tomorrow to shop all Amazon Prime Day deals!</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4219px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FRB8bq9d9iGLkwpu2gYMaK" name="Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-2024-render-metallic-jade.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRB8bq9d9iGLkwpu2gYMaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4219" height="4219" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>It is largely agreed upon that there's nothing like a Kindle when it comes to reading. Therefore, one that comes with a stylus for handwriting input is twice as awesome as a regular one. Usually, the Kindle Scribe makes for a poor purchase. But with this deal, it is a lot cheaper, helping it rise to the top as one of the best e-readers and E Ink tablets that money can buy. This deal includes the Premium Pen with the Kindle Scribe.</p><p><strong>Alternative deal</strong> 🪙: Onyx Boox Go Color 7 - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Go-Color-Gen-II/dp/B0F58ZHCX2/" data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99"><strong>$279.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9TDDN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$279.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25="$279.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need stylus support, weeks upon weeks of battery life, and a large B&W e-paper display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want unfettered access to Android apps on the Play Store and prefer color e-paper devices.</p><p>I've always had mixed feelings about the Kindle Scribe. While the e-reader slash E Ink tablet is a good product for reading and writing, the $420 price tag is too high. I'd rather recommend more powerful and higher-spec-bearing color e-paper tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Color-ePaper-Notebook/dp/B0DT3Q52PN/"><strong>Onyx Boox Note Air 4C for $500</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Go-Color-Gen-II/dp/B0F58ZHCX2/"><strong>Boox Go Color 7 which is just $280</strong></a>.</p><p>Thanks to this Prime Day deal, though, the Kindle Scribe is finally worth buying. As expected from any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">great E Ink tablet</a>, it has a gorgeous e-paper display that looks just like real books and consumes very little power. The display is what makes a Kindle so stunning, because Amazon's e-paper screens are extremely crisp and lovely to look at. The 10.2-inch display is just the right size, neither too big nor too small. You can choose from 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage options.</p><p>Battery-wise, the Kindle Scribe lasts for weeks on a single charge and comes with a USB Type-C port. Unlike some other Kindle models, the Amazon Kindle Scribe does not have water resistance.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I have a few thermal cameras on hand, and in the last two months, I relied on the handheld Thor 002 imaging camera by Thermal Master to monitor device thermals and identify hot spots.</p><p>The Thor 002 is an all-in-one device, and while the handheld is big ang bulky, it is packed with innovative tech. It has a 3.5-inch 60Hz panel, 5000mAh battery, and a new IR module that gives it a 521 x 384 resolution — considerably higher than other devices in this category. The thermal camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">costs $284 on Amazon with code TMTHOR002</a>, but that's only until this weekend; after that, it will go up to $399. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-1089859931413247931-20">plenty of deals still live</a> if you're looking to buy tech this Prime Day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ" name="Thermal Master Thor 002 Handheld Thermal Camera" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Thor 002 is a handheld thermal imaging camera that has the highest-resolution sensor in this category, making it the ideal choice if you need to monitor thermals of a tech gadget or locate any hot spots in your home. </p><p>✅Recommended if: You want a handheld thermal camera with the best sensor. The Thor 002 has a great IR sensor, and it overlays the thermal image over a real-time preview. There are plenty of filters available, and you'll only need to charge the battery once a week. </p><p>❌Skip this deal if: You need a smaller device. Thermal Master also makes a dongle-sized model called the P2 Pro that plugs into your phone, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-P2-Pro-Resolution-Lightning/dp/B0DYDZXCMC" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">that model is $239 right now</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">View Deal</a></p></div><p>It's easy to hold and use the Thor 002, and it charges via a USB-C cable. What I like is that you can easily slot in a MicroSD card to store photos. The 3.5-inch panel is ideally suited to monitor thermals, and the 60Hz panel is fluid. The panel has a standard 640×480 resolution, and it uses a new IR sensor to boost the resolution of the image to 521 x 384.</p><p>It's incredibly accurate at monitoring minute changes in heat, and it has the ability to go up to 1,022 degrees F. You get a max/min range, color profiles, and the ability to transfer data to your phone. It even gets 4x digital zoom, and the resolution is usable at that distance. The 5,000mAh battery lasts ten hours between charges, and while there's no fast charging, that really isn't a big omission in this scenario.</p><p>It comes in a hard shell case that's rugged, and the camera itself is built like a tank. The lens has a protective cover that's handy, and you can easily save readings to a MicroSD card. Overall, this is a professional testing tool if you need to monitor thermals or identify leaks, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">at $299 it is a good value</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Torras is showing that it knows how to make noteworthy accessories. I use the brand's phone cases, and its PolarCircle charger is pretty cool; it has the Qi 2 standard and connects to the back of any phone with a magnetic case, and there's a built-in kickstand that lets you use the phone while it's charging.</p><p>But the best feature has to be the built-in cooling solution. There's a fan that blows cool air, and it also utilizes "TEC semiconductor cooling" to ensure the contact point stays cool. This allows consistent 15W charging, and after using it with my iPhone 16 Pro Max a few dozen times, I'll admit that there's no overheating whatsoever. I notice some heat while using other Qi 2 chargers, but that just isn't the case with the PolarCircle. The Qi 2 charger is usually $59, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">you can still get it at $44</a> provided you act right now. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-4117118656319645735-20">thousands of deals still live</a> if you're interested in other accessories.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1109px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.87%;"><img id="PSNwtud4QdzCQ9NYRndC7C" name="Torras PolarCircle" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSNwtud4QdzCQ9NYRndC7C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1109" height="919" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The PolarCircle is just as small as other Qi 2 chargers, and while the inclusion of a fan makes it slightly thicker, it's still easily portable. The innovative cooling system is the biggest advantage to this charger, and it ensures the phone doesn't overheat even while gaming. Oh, and there's a built-in kickstand as well. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://torraslife.com/products/polarcircle-qi2" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44"><strong>$49 at Torras</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a powerful Qi 2 charger that lets you play games while your phone is charging. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Qi 2 power bank instead. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The PolarCircle does a great job delivering a consistent 15W charge. While it is bulkier than other Qi 2 chargers I used, you can still take it around anywhere with ease. You get a 2m USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and the built-in kickstand at the back is a welcome addition. The kickstand swivels 360 degrees, so you can easily position the charger as needed.</p><p>The unique cooling solution is designed to ensure there's no overheating, and I tested it while gaming. It does a terrific job ensuring the phone stays cool even during marathon gaming sessions, and that in itself is a huge deal. If nothing else, I'd suggest getting the PolarCircle just for its cooling abilities — the Qi 2 charging is just an added bonus. It is costlier than other Qi 2 chargers, but the cooling mechanism combined with the kickstand makes it worth the price — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">particularly at the deal price</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm not saying you <em>need </em>to own three smartwatches, as that can be pretty pricey and not everyone has that kind of money. Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> is here to alleviate some of that financial pressure, and if you <em>can </em>afford multiple, then I suggest you go for it: one for everyday use, one for the gym, and one for special occasions.</p><p>Depending on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> you own, it's possible that it can play all roles, but some are better suited for certain situations than others. I find myself switching what I'm wearing depending on where I'm going and what I'm doing, which made me realize that it's hard for one watch to do it all.</p><p>Here are my Prime Day picks for the three smartwatches I think you should consider.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</h2><p>The Galaxy Watch 5 has lasted me for quite a while, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Watch 7</a> improves on everything I love about the Watch 5. You get larger displays, larger batteries, more storage, and more RAM.

The projector has one of the brightest projectors in this category, and the ultra short throw nature of the lens means you can put it right next to a wall and get a 150-inch projection — no ceiling mount necessary.</p><p>It has the best picture quality of any projector I used, and the software has exclusive extras, including ambient backgrounds. I used the Aura 2 daily for the last six months, and it has been incredible. While it's still a high-end purchase, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">down to $2,149 on Amazon</a> until July 12, making it that much more affordable.

It is considerably smaller than other models, has an elegant design, gets incredibly bright even in a well-lit room, and is extremely easy to set up and use. You get Android TV out of the box, and the only issue with this projector is that you don't get Netflix. But if you're willing to use a Google TV box, this is the best projector deal around. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/aura-2" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149"><strong>$2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1887418-REG/xgimi_wm03b_aura_2_2300_lumen_uhd.html"><strong>$2,699 at B&H Photo</strong></a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a 4K laser projector with Dolby Vision. I used the Aura 2 for the better part of six months now, and it has been incredible. It's a considerable upgrade over the Aura, and it gets brighter than every other UST projector I used. You get auto keystone and autofocus, and it has an auto-closing cover that protects the lens when not in use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want Netflix pre-installed, or don't need a UST model. If you want to set up a standard ceiling-mounted option, I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Enhanced-Portable-Intelligent/dp/B0DDQ66B6L">getting the Horizon S Max at $1,519</a>. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>NexiGo Aurora Pro</strong></a><strong> — </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>$1,999 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149">View Deal</a></p></div><p>XGIMI did everything right with the Aura 2; the new design is striking, and it is smaller than the outdoing model. The best feature is a dust cover that prevents any dust ingress into the lens when it's not in use. This has made maintenance that much easier, and the motorized panel adds a decent flair to the design.</p><p>Picture quality is fantastic; I used the projector to see movies and TV shows, and it excels at Dolby Vision and HDR content. It goes up to 2300 lumens, and I didn't see any problems in a well-lit room — it's more than bright enough.</p><p>The Aura 2 is quite good at gaming as well, and I didn't see any issues playing games on the PS5 with the projector. It has latency of 20ms in the gaming mode, and if you want the best UST model in this area, Nexigo's Aurora Pro gets down to 8ms, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7">model is also on sale at $1,999 now</a>.</p><p>I still prefer the Aura 2 because of the design, better color vibrancy, and the auto keystone correction. I'm setting up an ALR panel shortly, but I used the projector against a bare wall and didn't see any issues. XGIMI is using a new image engine with wall color switching, so it dynamically adjusts the color balance after taking the background wall color into account. The Amazon deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">bringing it down to $2,149 is only valid until July 12</a>, so if you like the look of this projector, I'd suggest acting now.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The network streaming amplifier is incredible; it delivers 60W of power per channel at 8 ohms — going up to 120W at 4 ohms — and it offers the easiest way to connect passive speakers to the internet.</p><p>But you can find plenty of other amps that do the same thing. Where WiiM stands out is its ability to deliver multi-room audio, and the ease of use; its mobile app is loaded with features, and it connects to just about every digital assistant and music platform out there. I used the WiiM Amp with bookshelf speakers for over a year, and I'm buying another two units to connect other speakers I have in the house.</p><p>The $299 asking price in and of itself is a bargain, but for Prime Day, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H">get the Amp at just $239</a>, and that's just an unbeatable value.

The 4-bay F4-424 Max in particular is terrific; it has the beastly 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of RAM, and dual M.2 slots.</p><p>But where it has a clear advantage is with dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Basically, this is what you buy if you want to set up a high-end Plex NAS server that will last at least a decade. I used it for the better part of six months now, and it has been nothing short of astounding. While it usually retails for $899, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">Prime Day deal brings it down to $674</a>, making it a phenomenal value.

The minimal aesthetic is great, and it doesn't take up much room. I didn't see any issues with build quality either, and installing drives is about as easy as it gets.</p><p>It's the hardware where this NAS shines; the Intel Core i5 1235U platform is a powerhouse, and it unlocks hardware transcoding in Plex — if you have Plex Pass. There isn't another NAS that has the same caliber of power in this category, and if you want a high-end server to run Docker containers, Plex, and a dozen other utilities, you'll need to get this.</p><p>While most NAS systems now get a 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, you'll see two of these on the back of the F4-424 Max. What that essentially means is that even if you use the dual M.2 drives to slot in SSDs, the bandwidth won't be the bottleneck. The TOS 6 software is much better as well, and it has a modern design combined with plenty of useful additions, including a native Plex client.</p><p>I've tested dozens of NAS systems over the years, and the F4-424 Max is my go-to choice if you need a high-end server in 2025. There isn't anything missing on this NAS, and the $225 discount is highly enticing — but the deal won't last. This is your last chance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">get the F4-424 Max at $674</a>, so you better act fast.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I used the Outdoor String Lights and the String Lights 2 back when they launched, and they did a great job; that's why I was excited to see what the brand had to offer with its latest product, the Outdoor Clear Bulb String Lights.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Clear Bulb String Lights have a transparent housing that has better light transmittivity, and the new design looks much more elegant than the previous models. Thankfully, the casing itself is made out of polycarbonate and not glass, so they don't break; my two-year-old loves playing with these lights, and they've proven to be durable. They usually cost $99, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1">they're now down to $79</a>, a decent discount.

They diffuse light well, go up to 80 lumen, the RGB LEDs have over a hundred built-in effects, and the polycarbonate shell is built to last. They have IP67 water resistance as well, so there are no issues using these lights outdoors. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need outdoor lights that can be easily controlled with your phone. Govee's app has standout features, and you also have the ability to pair these lights with Home Assistant. The lights have vibrant LEDs, great effects, and are durable. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want clear lights. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof-Assistant/dp/B0CT4ZR4Y9" data-dimension112="7f83e239-573d-4b66-9108-0602cc4f3347" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension48="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension25="$79"><strong>Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft) </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof-Assistant/dp/B0CT4ZR4Y9"><strong> $109 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7f83e239-573d-4b66-9108-0602cc4f3347" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension48="Alternate deal: Govee Outdoor String Lights 2 (144ft)" data-dimension25="$79">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Govee did a great job with the design of the Clear Bulb String Lights; they look much better than their predecessors, and I like the polycarbonate housing — it diffuses light very well. I'm using the 48ft model, and that's adequate for my needs; if you've got a bigger backyard, Govee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0F23QKYFY">sells a 96ft model of the same</a> — but there's no deal on that.</p><p>The lights are extremely easy to set up and use, and what I like the most is the built-in lighting effects; just connect the lights to the Govee Home app, and you can unlock over 100 lighting effects and presets. It's straightforward to change brightness, lighting modes, and set up schedules, and this is where Govee's products truly shine.</p><p>Each bulb has 80-lumen brightness, and if you don't want RGB lighting, they default to the standard 2700k warm white mode. They connect via Matter, and once set up, you can easily change lighting modes via Google Assistant or Alexa. The hassle-free usability and bright lighting makes these the ideal choice if you want backyard or patio lighting, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1">20% discount makes the lights that much more affordable</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Another patent outlined a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">dual temperature sensor</a> that would still measure your skin temperature but also check the temperature of something else (like a child's forehead) with the <em>outside</em> of the ring.

And currently, Samsung is more focused on sleep tracking for its <em>smartwatches</em>, giving the Galaxy Watch 8 a Bedtime Guidance tool to analyze your circadian rhythm and suggest an ideal bedtime.

The problem is, wireless audio is also expensive. If you're on a tight budget, it's almost always smarter to pick up a great pair of wired earbuds or in-ear monitors (IEMs) rather than waste money on a cheap pair of truly wireless earbuds.</p><p>If you want to upgrade your audio during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a>, you can do so while spending less than $20 by picking up one of these in-ear monitors. You'll get excellent sound quality and a detachable cable on all three of my picks, and two of them have optional microphones.

They're great for throwing in a bag as a backup plan in case you forget your primary audio gear at home. If you grab a microphone-equipped version, you can take Google Meet or Zoom calls on the go without relying on your phone or laptop's awful mic quality.</p><p>I also like wired earbuds because they're cheap — you can be a bit reckless with them, not worrying about damaging gear worth hundreds of dollars.

And it's even worse when you combine the two, such is the case with a lot of these newer retro gaming handhelds. Since there are so many to choose from, and Prime Day 2025 in full swing, I figured it'd be a good time to share five of my current favorites.</p><p>The great thing about having so many options is that there are a bunch of different designs to choose from. Especially since we've been seeing a resurgence in clamshell handhelds since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG35XXSP-Handheld-3-5-inch-Simulators-Protector/dp/B0F2T4JFQ5/">RG35XXSP</a> last year. Now, we have options like the RG34XXSP, which includes dual joysticks, an excellent hinge, and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG34XXSP-Foldable-Handheld-Joystick-Bluetooth/dp/B0F6KCMWB2"><strong>on sale for 15% off</strong></a> on Prime Day.</p><p>But that's not the only option, as we have the classic Miyoo Mini Plus, which has been around for the past few years and can be had for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Console-Classic-Consoles-Wireless-Handheld/dp/B0DC6QHQ3Y/"><strong>under $50</strong></a>. Then there's the TrimUI Brick, which is more powerful than the Miyoo Mini Plus and has one of the best screens I've ever used on a retro handheld. Oh, and it's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Console-Multiple-Classic-Emulators-System-Purple/dp/B0F3D7GMGQ"><strong>on sale for 10% off</strong></a> over at Amazon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9067931038562183873-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><em><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow night!

However, there are a few options out there that might look good on paper, but definitely won't deliver an enjoyable experience when it arrives.</p><p>These include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/2025Newly-Upgraded-Handheld-Console-Portable/dp/B0F3HY8C39/">V40 Max</a>, which has an awful D-pad and triggers, and the performance is severely lacking. Then there's something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ugonetend-Handheld-Game-Emulators-Boy-Color/dp/B0DFVWZP82/">X6 handheld</a>, which again looks good, and is even cheaper than anything else on this list. However, you'll end up with something that feels like it belongs in a kid's Happy Meal, and not a handheld that you paid more than $30 for.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1248299418137620679-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day ENDS tomorrow: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4973438238680117812-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1412450387039812902-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8499083099664266844-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7345722623432036365-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You get fantastic EQ and customization options in the Sony Headphones Connect app. You also have unique audio modes like Sony's 360 Reality Audio and an ear tip fit test to make sure they fit just right in your ears.</p><p>Sony also has standout support for Bluetooth audio codecs, which audiophiles will love to hear. SBC, AAC, LDAC, and LC3 are all available on the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds. Specifically, LDAC is a proprietary Sony codec that can handle 24-bit/96kHz sample rates at a bitrate of up to 990kbps. In layman's terms, the Sony WF-1000XM5 could quite literally sound better than any other pair of wireless earbuds on the market.</p><p>Whether you're looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/from-usd19-earbuds-to-flagship-phones-heres-the-prime-day-travel-tech-id-actually-buy">shore up your travel gear during Prime Day</a> or just need an audio refresh, the Sony WF-1000XM5 are such an underrated buy this time of year.

But I appreciate this unique and clever approach to solving the battery problem with my glasses, and I'm hopeful it'll solve my problems.</p><p>Eventually, I'm going to look into Meta Oakley glasses, which have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">doubled battery life over the Ray-Ban Metas</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">leaked 3rd-generation Ray-Ban Metas</a> that are supposed to have "significantly longer battery life" than my current pair.

According to this executive, the company is looking at launching its next tablets, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, "shortly." The unnamed source didn't give specifics; however, they state the tablets will see a launch timeframe close to Samsung's "traditional cadence."</p><p>The publication's source stating the launch adheres to Samsung's "traditional" cadence seems a little strange. It sounds like they're referring to its launch timeframe but, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">other than the Galaxy Tab S10</a>, its recent tablets have launched earlier in the year.</p><p>The last series debuted in September (Sept. 26 to be specific), which was a one month shift from the Galaxy Tab S9 and seven month difference for the S8 series. The latter debuted in February 2022, while the former appeared in August 2023.</p><p>The publication speculates we should see the Tab S11 in September again this year, which sounds more plausible, unless Samsung stuns us with an August reveal.</p><h2 id="the-tab-s11-could-switch-up-the-series-again-2">The Tab S11 could switch up the series (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 rumor trail goes back a few months, but its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">leak claims the Ultra model</a> will debut with a powered-up chip. The Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted running through Geekbench for its performance test; however, it was listed with a MediaTek chip: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC</a>. This is MediaTek's refreshed response to Qualcomm's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Strangely, reports said the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" despite rocking this flagship chip. The SoC features a strong GPU that helps facilitate "PC-like" graphical performance on mobile devices.</p><p>Also, with the Tab S11 series (hopefully) coming up, rumors have stated Samsung is switching things up by returning the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">and dropping the Plus</a>. We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already looking around</a> for the base Galaxy Tab S10 after Samsung only gave us a Plus and Ultra. Now, we're just confused. Regardless, Tab S11 is rumored to feature a 8,160mAh battery, while the Ultra could jump to  ~11,374mAh this year.</p><p>Earlier rumors suggested Samsung would save the Tab S11 series for a launch after Unpacked, meaning sometime in the fall. So, perhaps its debut will mirror the Tab S10 after all.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16126339?hl=en&ref_topic=16079905&sjid=14845917384801852633-NA&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">support page</a>,  Google says users can then add a text description into the box, informing the AI of <em>how </em>they want the video to be generated.</p><p>The post states users should be as descriptive as possible, detailing the scene and "any audio instructions" to Gemini. After finishing, users should navigate beneath the text box to <strong>More > Veo > Submit.</strong></p><p>These clips won't be full-length YouTube-esque videos, mind you.

Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers "globally" can expect the feature to start appearing today (July 10) in Gemini. What's more, the post says users can expect these same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">photo-to-video capabilities in Flow</a>, too.</p><p>Google also highlights its commitment to safety with its AI tools, stating that it's taken "significant steps" to ensure an "appropriate experience."</p><p>What's funny about this "new" feature rolling out in Gemini today is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-to-debut-google-cloud-powered-ai-image-to-video-feature">we've seen before</a>. In May, Google launched five second clip generation capabilities using its Google Cloud AI-powered software for the Honor 400 series. The feature works the same way as what you'll find in Gemini, turning regular photos into animated clips. What key difference was the launch on Honor's 400 series came with the Veo 2 model, and later required a Google subscription for continued use.</p><p>Veo 3 was shining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-youtube-shorts-integration-creator-creativity-report">highlight during I/O 2025</a>, as Google detailed its audio capabilities and lifelike video strength. As Gemini picks up its prowess for breathing animation into photos, YouTube was also interested in bringing Veo 3 into the fold for Shorts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Almost a year later, and that has not happened, with the Super Nova still being docked right on my desk.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1316556028087985621-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE: See the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4" name="gamesir-super-nova-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>GameSir Super Nova:</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCLD9PLY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1329189071882698668-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension25=""> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>$59.99</del> <strong>$39.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>There are a lot of controllers out there, even from GameSir itself, but the Super Nova remains my favorite of the bunch.

It probably won't take long to realize why I might like this, since it's basically the same design as Microsoft's controller, down to the rubberized grips.</p><p>The controls are all nice and responsive, and I don't even feel the need to install GameSir's Nexus app on my PC. Part of that is because I'm pretty basic and don't really use things like the paddle controls on the back. What I do use, however, are the trigger switches. This shortens the travel distance before the input is recognized, and is an absolute necessity when I'm playing Call of Duty.</p><p>And on top of all of that, I never have to worry about plugging in or replacing batteries, as the Super Nova comes with a charging dock. So when I'm done playing, I just put it back on the dock until the next gaming session rolls around.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-37">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9764014712696558246-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6188859583910098122-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3325142520077420800-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4166824583098299148-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1424464865141903563-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company highlights this channel as an "experimental new option for developers" interested in getting early glimpses at in-development Android features and APIs. This first release is rolling out for Pixel owners ranging from the Pixel 6 series up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">to the Pixel 9</a>, including the Pixel Fold and Tablet.</p><p>Developers with an eligible Pixel phone can begin downloading the ZP11.250606.010.A1  build to test the latest Android version contents.</p><p>However, even though this is for developers, Google stresses that these early Android API builds are deep in their testing era. Builds, such as the first one via the Canary Release Channel today, "may contain bugs or issues that could affect your device's normal operations." These builds aren't "suitable for everyday use," so developers might want to have another device on standby as their daily driver.</p><p>In a separate newsletter, obtained by Android Central's News Editor, Nandika Ravi, developers can help "build for new foldables and wearables." The letter highlights the ability to help build new adaptive apps for phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">like the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7</a> for more "immersive experiences" that "adaptively" respond to these unique devices. Moreover, developers can also get their hands on the tools required to build new, refreshing features in Wear OS 6.</p><h2 id="android-s-soaring-with-canary-2">Android's soaring with Canary</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1lwjvwh/introducing_the_android_canary_release_channel">Introducing the Android Canary Release Channel!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The Reddit post states developers can flash the latest Canary build onto their Android device or they can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/canary#on_emulatoroper.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds">Android Emulator</a> via Android Studio. Once it's installed, your device becomes eligible for future Canary patches and updates. These are expected to occur "once a month." Be warned: if you're looking to leave the Android Canary channel, your device will have to undergo a full data wipe.</p><p>If the name "Canary" sounds familiar, it's because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Google's Chrome Canary</a> test environment for users and developers. Anyone can download Chrome Canary to try out the latest advancements, features, and more headed for Chrome before anyone else (using Stable) see it. Google sees it as a way to squash terrible bugs <em>before </em>they become an issue.</p><p>One key difference is that Chrome Canary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-release-channels">is updated far more frequently</a> than Google's plans for Android Canary. According to its dev doc, Chrome Canary is updated once a day and, at times, multiple times a day. Of course, some of these more frequent updates in a single day is because Canary "can (and does) break," per Google.</p><p>The company's been busy testing a wide range of Chrome features, ranging from AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-password-data-breach-help-spotted">protect users from data breaches</a> to better enhancements from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">phishing attempts/scams</a>.</p><p>It's also been a little over two weeks since Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-2-1-starts-rolling-out-to-pixels-with-some-bug-fixes">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2.1</a> to Pixel testers. The minor patch was filled with a few fixes that were plaguing devices following the more substantial 2.0 update. Users on Reddit are awaiting the 3.0 update, as are we.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you’ve got a good memory, this isn’t totally out of the blue: back in 2022, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-sets-the-new-standard-with-four-generations-of-os-upgrades-to-ensure-the-most-up-to-date-and-more-secure-galaxy-experience" target="_blank">promised</a> up to four years of One UI Watch and Wear OS updates for the Watch 4 lineup.</p><p>However, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-beta-3-rolls-out-for-galaxy-s25-and-galaxy-watches-see-their-first-beta">Samsung dropped the One UI 8 Watch beta</a>, it kind of looked like the Galaxy Watch 4 was being quietly pushed aside. A footnote in the beta release mentioned it was only for the Galaxy Watch 5 or newer, leaving many of us scratching our heads.</p><h2 id="beta-confusion-cleared-up-2">Beta confusion cleared up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6QcGwVWwAKAMkRPWHY4eCB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-4-lifestyle.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6QcGwVWwAKAMkRPWHY4eCB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just when most of us had written off the Watch 4 as yesterday’s news, Samsung obviously had other plans. After some confusion and plenty of speculation online, the company has now officially confirmed that the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup is getting the same fresh coat of software paint that's rolling out to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">newer Galaxy Watches</a>.</p><p>This marks the last major update for these four-year-old watches, which originally rolled out with Wear OS 3 and One UI Watch 3 out of the box.</p><p>One UI 8 Watch packs in a bunch of upgrades you’d think were just for the newer model, like better health tracking, deeper sleep data, and Galaxy AI tricks that Samsung won’t stop talking about.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 series is powered by the 4nm Exynos W920 with just two Cortex-A55 cores, so it’s anyone’s guess how well One UI 8 Watch will actually run on it. It's highly probable that some of the fancier, newer features destined for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> series might not make it to the older hardware.</p><p>Still, it’s a nice move for anyone sticking with their Galaxy Watch 4. Instead of being left behind, the watch is getting a refresh and a few upgrades to keep things feeling new again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Most of them paid the full $350–400 for one, and may feel some regret looking at this 32%-off Prime Day deal: The Pixel Watch 3 is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D9138ZXM"><strong>$237.49 ($112.50 off) on Amazon</strong></a>, while the larger 45mm model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D91268TH"><strong>$115 off</strong></a>.</p><p>Google started off Prime Day with both models at $100 off, all-time lows for this expensive smartwatch.

For most people, that's more than enough to charge up multiple smartphones, even with the power distribution between each port in use. One USB-C port is perfect for laptops and higher-power devices, while two USB-C ports can simultaneously charge up to a total of 140W (up to 70W per port). Have to charge three devices? You still get up to 140W between the ports (65W + 45W + 30W).</p><p>Putting that into perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is one of the fastest-charging Android phones in North America, and it supports top speeds of 80W or 100W (depending on where in the world you are).

This Anker charger is more than enough for most users.</p><p>Beyond fast charging, it features a cool display that shows the actual charging speed in real-time per port, and it includes temperature monitoring with a cooling mode to prevent overheating. And for good measure, the display also features a cute emoticon that indicates when the charger is idle.</p><p>Super-fast charging, multiple ports, a display, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/best-usb-adapter-for-travel">portable design</a>?

Not only that, but the adjustable wrist strap fits all hand sizes — from kids to adults — and helps balance the controllers better in your hands.</p><p>That makes them <em>far</em> more comfortable for long play sessions and even helps you better throw objects while playing in VR. When you can actually let go of the controllers and not worry about them ending up in the drywall, you gain serious confidence and skill that'll get you to the top of those leaderboards.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3s-prime-day-deal-2025" target="_blank"><strong>The best Meta Quest 3S sale we've ever seen is live during Prime Day</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="08e8f7b8-d771-4dfd-a15a-8c2ae02fce8f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension48="AMVR controller grips:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qHaL56gPUWPTg2sgbK4H6" name="amvr-meta-quest-3-controller-handles.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qHaL56gPUWPTg2sgbK4H6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AMVR controller grips:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J" data-dimension112="08e8f7b8-d771-4dfd-a15a-8c2ae02fce8f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension48="AMVR controller grips:" data-dimension25=""><strong> </strong><del>$23.99</del><strong> $15.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>These minimalist grips fit on Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S controllers, replacing the battery door with a grippy texture and an adjustable hand strap that keeps your controllers in your hands, even when you completely let go.

Just pop the door out like usual and snap it back in when you're done!</p><p>But not everyone likes the feel of the smooth plastic of the Meta Quest Touch controllers. That's why Kiwi Design's choice of grips is a great choice. They're a bit more expensive than the minimalist AMVR strap, but the soft-touch silicone material covers your entire Quest controller (with cutouts for the tracking LEDs), preventing hand sweat and adding extra grip in the process.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.07%;"><img id="vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS" name="meta-quest-3s-kiwi-design-g4-pro-controller-grips-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnVrqpbLQVa8ZYYaoCQ3BS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1411" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DFXW7JTN/" data-dimension112="5bb63375-666e-407f-a19a-c2ae982a116b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension48="Kiwi Design upgraded controller grips: $34.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$34.99</del><strong> $27.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Kiwi Design's upgraded controller grips envelop your controllers in a comfy silicone bumper, preventing slippage and sweat.

During a press interview with Roh, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says">The Korea Times</a> highlighted a part of the discussions where the long-rumored "Galaxy G Fold" was brought up. According to Roh, the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year."</p><p>Roh spoke about those Galaxy G Fold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet.</p><p>With this, we can probably expect the phone sometime between now (July) and December. However, Roh's statement might pit the tri-fold closer to a year-end release. The publication cites Roh's estimation in saying the phone might launch "at the end of this year."</p><p>Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't yield any other specifications or neat features about the tri-fold. We'll have to wait a little while longer, but there should be some official Samsung teasers when we get close.</p><h2 id="needs-a-little-longer-2">Needs a little longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During Galaxy Unpacked in January, Samsung teased what consumers can expect from it following the Galaxy S25 series launch. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">in its "roadmap,"</a> there was a unique device: a tri-fold. While a surprise, Samsung has shown off its tri-fold device prototypes a few times, especially during the CES 2025 event. The company opted to focus more on its Android XR device, instead, perhaps hinting that the phone wasn't anywhere near completion.</p><p>Shortly after, in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">rumors started coming out</a>, stating Samsung was looking at naming the phone the Galaxy G Fold. There's speculation that a new "display and film" could be found on the device's alleged 10-inch display. And it seems it might not top Huawei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a> level of thinness.</p><p>More importantly, early rumors claimed Samsung could debut the device anywhere between late 2025 and early 2026. With Roh's recent comments, perhaps it's the former we should keep our eyes on.</p><p>Anyway, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/biggest-announcements-from-samsungs-summer-unpacked-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-and-more">Unpacked event yesterday</a> (July 9) brought us the Galaxy Z Flip 7, Flip 7 FE, Fold 7, and its latest Galaxy Watch 8 series. The Flip 7 has been upgraded with a more immersive edge-to-edge 4-inch display, while the Fold 7 slims down quite a bit after ditching the S Pen. Even the base Galaxy Watch 8 became a bit thinner, as Samsung packed loads of new health and sleep-focused features into the series.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You don't need to spend more than $20 to get the highest quality screen protection for your foldable's internal and external displays.</p><p>There are a few names that keep popping up time and time again when it comes to screen protector brands. IMBZBK and Milomdoi in particular always deliver, both in terms of quality and value. The three-pack from IMBZBK is the most comprehensive kit available for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Getting three sets of three items along with two frames for under $20 is a magnificent bargain. Both easy-install frames enable perfect at-home installation. The lens protectors are an added bonus.</p><p>If you're not comfortable replacing the internal screen protector off of the folding screen, you don't need to step out of your comfort zone. Simply get a cover display protector alone, which will be more cost-effective too. Spigen's upgraded GlastR EZ Fit Pro for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a good option. It comes with a frame that also acts as a dust-removing tool, simplifying the installation process. This kit includes two pieces for about $17, but if you want a cheaper alternative, consider the three-pack from Mr.Shield that only costs $7. There's no assistive frame or tool included, however, so take that into consideration before going forward with your purchase.</p><p>After grabbing a solid screen protection kit, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> for advanced impact absorption.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the naming scheme, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic doesn't really come in a dark color like black, charcoal, or graphite. If that's a deal breaker, perhaps you'll be happier with the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 in Graphite</a> instead — sans rotating bezel, though.</p><p>Don't knock the Black variant of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic until you've seen it up close and personal. I know many people only buy black tech. In fact, my husband is one such individual. However, variety is the spice of life. So spice things up with this silver-and-black combo for once! It looks really cool and matches well with various styles and materials of watch bands.</p><p>If the non-monochrome look bothers you, then the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in White will fit your tastes. This option is silver throughout and comes with a bright white band.</p><p>I do have a bone to pick with Samsung over the limited case colors. My favorite hue for wearables is usually gold, rose gold, or champagne gold. This is because it's much easier to match such shades with accessories and jewelry. It's a missed opportunity on Samsung's part to skip a warmer colorway for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're stuck with these options for this generation, so there's not much to do but complain. Hopefully, Samsung will heed our grievances with its next smartwatch lineup. If not, then people like me will probably stick with the Google Pixel Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, if you were hoping to waltz into a Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile store and add it to your existing plan with convenient financing, you're out of luck.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/you-cant-buy-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-from-carriers-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">U.S. carriers</a> have collectively decided to give the Z Flip 7 FE a wide berth.</p><p>Right now, your choices are slim. You can grab the unlocked model straight from Samsung’s online store or try your luck at places like Best Buy or Amazon. Either way, you're looking at paying full price or hopping on Samsung’s payment plan, neither of which quite hits like those sweet carrier promos.</p><h2 id="some-underdogs-step-up-2">Some underdogs step up</h2><p>Now, before you completely despair, there are a couple of small-time players who are actually offering the device. Boost Mobile and Xfinity Mobile are apparently offering the Z Flip 7 FE for free with certain postpaid plans, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/z-flip-7-fe-carrier-3576231/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>So, if you've been looking for an excuse to switch carriers, Samsung might have just given you one, albeit for a phone that the big players are apparently side-eyeing.</p><p>It’s not like Samsung didn’t try to give the FE some shine. It comes with all the expected trimmings of the Flip series, minus a few high-end frills to keep the price down. That makes it a sweet deal for anyone curious about foldables but not ready to drop flagship cash.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-the-cold-shoulder-2">Why the cold shoulder?</h2><p>There’s no official explanation yet, which just fuels the confusion. Maybe Samsung didn’t want to cannibalize its flagship foldables. Maybe carriers weren’t thrilled with the specs-to-price ratio. Or maybe the logistics didn’t pan out in time for launch.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that if you want the Z Flip 7 FE in the U.S., you’ll need to skip the carrier stores and go straight to the source.</p><p>On the bright side, unlocked buyers won’t have to deal with bloatware or the usual maze of carrier-specific delays when it comes to updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3219eac3-88d6-43d9-9891-128ad440b605">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is definitely a step-up from its predecessor, especially if you've been eyeing the competition with a bit of envy.

The machine-translated description box says the seller is offering the motherboard of the phone in question, which looks similar to what we've seen in past leaks. The alleged Pixel 10 still sports those rounded corners and flat edges, just like Google's past-gen.</p><p>The back, which furthers its prototype nature, displays the "G" logo and a horizontal camera bump with an extra lens. The photo of the motherboard features a bolded "G5," which likely indicates the phone's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> SoC.</p><p>There appear to be three lenses inside the Pixel 10's camera island and its LED flash. The Chinese seller states this device is in its EVT stage, which the publication notes indicates the "final stage" before mass production for the market. However, 9to5 picked up on an oddity, which is the phone's fastboot mode screen that displays DVT (Design Validation Test) instead of the seller's alleged EVT stage.</p><h2 id="an-earlier-pixel-10-2">An Earlier Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:781px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.90%;"><img id="PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL" name="google-pixel-10-chinese-auction-site-leak" alt="An alleged Pixel 10 in black on sale on a Chinese auction website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PKKNwurqhWzQgVeAp8GWvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="781" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GooFish)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The trail of Pixel 10 leaks about its camera upgrade started in March, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a batch of renders</a> showcased it with three, not two. Aside from the seemingly identical design to the Pixel 9, there was speculation that this third lens would bring the base model closer to its Pro and Pro XL siblings. In June, we were met with a report that suggested the Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">would grab a telephoto lens addition</a>.

This deal is for the base model, which features 128GB of storage, though buyers can also upgrade to the 256GB version, or to a bundle that comes with the Galaxy Buds FE.</p><p>While Samsung has been releasing so-called "Fan Edition" phones since 2020, the S24 didn't bring many differences to the table. Still, we've always called these phones flagship killers, as they feature a really nice balance of affordability and overall performance, and this price point makes the phone even more appealing. It's also available in gray, graphite, blue, and mint, as far as colors are concerned.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE: See the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE:" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLD9PLY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="GYcHwbWPhdNCLeCLXXwK4D" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-render-extra-space" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYcHwbWPhdNCLeCLXXwK4D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 FE:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLD9PLY" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$649.99</del> <strong>$469.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Right now, Amazon is offering the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE for 28% off the normal purchase price, and bringing this mid-range phone down to under $500.

Do you pick from only what's in your budget, or do you look for specific features that work best for you? I've found that RayNeo Air 3S is a fantastic pair of smart glasses with an ultra-comfortable display and a price tag that doesn't sting, especially with this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4"> <strong>$44 off</strong> <strong>Prime Day deal</strong></a>.</p><p>We already named RayNeo Air 3S the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best value smart glasses</a> at its regular price of $269, but this Prime Day deal brings it down to an unheard of $225, making them <em>the</em> most affordable pair of 2025 smart display glasses you'll find anywhere. I take a pair of smart glasses on every work trip, and I've been finding myself using RayNeo Air 3S most often because of the comfortable display with 3840Hz PWM dimming and hardware-level blue light blocking.</p><p>Like other smart display glasses, you'll plug the RayNeo Air 3S into basically any computer, console, smartphone, or tablet with a USB-C port and be presented with a giant projected virtual screen that only you can see. This one is a 1080p display, so it looks as crisp as a TV hanging on your wall and helps eliminate neck pain caused by looking down at a laptop or handheld gaming system for too long.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.41%;"><img id="PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL" name="RayNeo Air 3S" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfQe5DAyAUyKTqGLtwHJCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>RayNeo Air 3S 😎</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$"><del>$269</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank"><strong>$225 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"With the Air 3S, RayNeo crafted what may possibly be the best budget XR glasses. The glasses are lighter than their predecessor, and you still get a massive 201-inch micro-OLED panel with vibrant colors and good contrast levels. RayNeo added useful eye protection features, and the glasses connect easily to your phone, tablet, Windows and macOS machine as well as handheld gaming console. The design isn't the most comfortable around, and the glasses let in ambient light, but if you're curious about what XR glasses have to deliver, you should get your hands on these." — Harish Jonnalagadda for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you use a lot of portable devices. Whether it's around the house or while traveling, these devices can hurt your neck, but a pair of smart glasses like RayNeo Air 3S put the screen right in front of your face, so you can relax and give your neck a break without cutting out any of the fun or productivity.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a high-end pair of smart display glasses. Brands like Xreal and Viture offer better specs and more premium features, but are more expensive and often weigh more.</p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/rayneo-air-3s-ar-xr-smart-glasses-with-201-micro-oled-dark-grey/6626541.p?skuId=6626541">$225 at Best Buy</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.rayneo.com/products/rayneo-air-3s-xr-glasses">$225 at RayNeo</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses with myopia adjustments - </strong><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Glasses-HueView-Display-Portable/dp/B0FFSHMQQ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2a269bde-9787-4196-be1e-e338929de117" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $269" data-dimension48="Was: $269" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>RayNeo Air 3S comfortable display is powered by a pair of HueView 120Hz micro-OLED displays, giving each eye a 1080p display. Unlike most smart glasses, these use 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage brightness, ensuring comfort for the vast majority of people. For reference, your Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel phone uses 240Hz or 480Hz PWM dimming. The higher that number goes, the more comfortable it is for your eyes long-term.</p><p>These glasses use a classic "birdbath-style" lens to reflect the micro-OLED display in the glasses toward your eyes. Think of them as tiny mirrors hanging just inside the glasses' frame. Because of the way the optics work, your eyes perceive this display as a huge TV projected a few feet away.</p><p>Folks who need prescription glasses can order a custom pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://honsvr.com/product/custom-rayneo-air-2s-prescription-lenses-by-honsvr/">through HonsVR for $50</a>. I use these inserts in my smart glasses to ensure I don't have any eye strain, and they're super easy to install since they just clip into the dedicated slot between the nose pads.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch 2 gamer, you should also check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">this Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> to play your Switch 2 on the go with these OLED glasses.

You can get Viture Pro smart glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/"><strong>on sale for $349</strong></a> for Prime Day, which will give you a sharper, brighter display with lenses that can dim themselves when the environment around you gets bright.</p><p>RayNeo Air 3S doesn't offer any kind of light blocking, so they can be sometimes difficult to see if you're using them outside or in a super bright room. If you're just using them in an airport, on a plane, or in our own home, you don't really need this feature. Still, Viture glasses have full support for Viture's extensive system of accessories and add-ons, which is a great reason to pick Viture over other companies.</p><p>Viture also offers myopia adjustment diopter wheels independently for each eye, allowing nearsighted users to adjust for clarity without having to buy a separate set of prescription lenses. That alone cuts $50 off the price if you need glasses, making these a great value so long as your prescription isn't greater than -5.00.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ" name="viture-pro-ecosystem-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2x4swqbMndsQa27S2EX3ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Viture Pro smart glasses: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del><strong> $349 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Viture Pro smart glasses offer an extra-crisp 1080p visuals, 1000 nits of brightness, built-in myopia adjustment diopters up to -5.00, and full support for Viture's extensive range of add-ons and accessories, now on sale for <strong>$150 off </strong>during Prime Day.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f484575d-9600-4c28-84f9-efdb9bce293d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension48="Viture Pro smart glasses: $499" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The king of smart glasses right now are Xreal One, which are on sale for the first time since their launch earlier this year.

But then Baseus came along and showcased what it can do in this category; the PrimeTrip VR2 Max is designed to take things to a whole new level, thanks to 163W of power delivery and four charging ports in total.</p><p>But what I like the most is that the charger comes with two retractable cables. I recently used a UGREEN car charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD">that has a built-in retractable cable</a> and thought that was cool, but it isn't as good as what Baseus is offering. Oh, and the best part? The VR2 Max is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y">down to just $29 right now</a>, a sizeable 40% discount on its $49 retail price. Need other tech?

The inclusion of two retractable USB-C cables makes all the difference, and if you need a new car charger, you should just get this. </p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a car charger that's designed to deal with cable clutter. Both retractable USB-C cables tuck into the body of the charger when not in use. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need as many charging ports. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29"><strong>UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger </strong></a><strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charging-Cigarette-Compatible/dp/B0DSBRM6BD"><strong>$27 on Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charger-Charging-PrimeTrip/dp/B0F8T4RH9Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fa5b346f-41e9-4078-996e-0eb50758686a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension48="Alternative deal: UGREEN 90W Retractable Car Charger" data-dimension25="$29">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Look, I can talk about the power budget and go into detail on how the four ports allocate the 163W available, and how the USB-C1 port goes up to 67W. But I don't need to do all that; all you need to know about this car charger is that it has two retractable USB-C cables — each extending to 31.5 inches — and they neatly tuck into the charger when not in use. There's an additional USB-C port alongside USB-A connectivity if two cables aren't enough.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that the charger swivels? It has 180-degree vertical rotation and 270-degree horizontal rotation, so you can easily route the cables to whichever part of the car you or your passengers are sitting in. I used this charger for the better part of two months now, and it has been nothing short of brilliant.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

There's not much to decide here as Samsung only launched two colors this time, and both come in two size options each.

Whether you choose the 40mm or 44mm option, it looks good in both. However, Silver isn't as versatile as Graphite when it comes to matching with outfits.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="here-s-how-you-should-choose-the-right-galaxy-watch-8-color-for-yourself-2">Here's how you should choose the right Galaxy Watch 8 color for yourself</h2><p>Settling on one of the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> color variants isn't a tough call to make. You either go for Silver or Graphite, and the watch bands are secondary. Since the bands can always be swapped out to suit the outfit or occasion anyway, don't focus on them when making your choice.</p><p>I highly recommend opting for the colorway that matches the majority of your clothes and accessories. For example, I prefer to wear gold or rose gold accessories, so a Silver Galaxy Watch 8 would clash awfully with most of my jewelry. That's why I'd personally buy the Graphite variant of the Watch 8. I can always swap the straps to a golden metal link one to glam it up or make it look more elegant. Golden doesn't look that bad with black. I'm sure you get the gist.</p><p>So, if your bracelets and clothes lean more towards a silvery aesthetic, you should get the Silver option instead. It's going to be a thousand times easier to style.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Bellini does echo the current Headliner look, but it'll be worth watching if these distinct designs actually make it to shelves.</p><p>These code names aren't new, as they were also mentioned in a May report by The Information, linking them to future Meta eyewear releases.</p><h2 id="smarter-longer-lasting-2">Smarter + longer lasting</h2><p>According to XR Research Institute, both models boast significantly longer battery life compared to the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray‑Ban Meta glasses</a>. And they could pack smarter AI too, with features like real-time object detection and scene recognition.</p><p>These rumored features line up with what The Information reported earlier—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">a “super sensing” mode that could keep Meta AI running for hours</a>, a big leap from the current 30-minute limit.</p><p>Potential new tricks include reminders for forgotten items and facial recognition: imagine being told someone's name as soon as they walk into view.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.53%;"><img id="yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzUcNoVNSAkUFimTZTfwnQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1038" height="867" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:882px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.83%;"><img id="jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ" name="Ray-Ban Meta 3" alt="two pairs of rumored Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZbkB8ko7pTeLfd644NynQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="882" height="854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute via UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Beyond facial recognition, Meta’s AI might soon get even smarter. Picture it reminding you to grab your keys if you forgot, or nudging you about groceries as you head home. The super-sensing mode keeps the cameras and sensors running nonstop so the AI can stay locked in on your day-to-day activities.</p><p>Here’s where timing gets interesting. XR Research Institute thinks these models might arrive before the year’s end. But The Information puts Aperol and Bellini off until 2026.</p><p>Currently, Ray‑Ban Meta glasses come in various frame styles (Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler), all compatible with clear, sun, polarized, and Transitions lenses. But this rumored pivot to separate optical and sunglass models could signal a bold new direction for the lineup.</p> ]]></dc:content>

scenarios. The only issue with the keychain is that the keyring is on the smaller side, and it isn't possible to hook a finger inside the keyring. I just took out the tracker and put it on another keyring, and that solved the problem.</p><p>Another annoyance is that these trackers are limited to the Find My network, and they don't show up on Google's redesigned Find Hub. So you'll need to have an iPhone to take advantage of the trackers; I would like to see Satechi roll out Android-based versions of these trackers, but that's not on the cards now. If you've got an iPhone and want reliable Qi-enabled trackers, the FindAll collection gets my recommendation.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

This means you can score super fast charging upgrades for your car on the cheap while the sale lasts. The bonus is that you don't need to worry about buying a cable either, as both car chargers come with retractable USB-C cables.</p><p>I have used both car chargers and found them equally suitable. They both offer a plug-and-play experience. In terms of the built-in cable size, I give Anker the win over UGREEN because it's got a slightly longer 29.4-inch or 75cm cable, whereas the UGREEN cord measures 70cm long. However, UGREEN's option has more ports and can deliver a higher power output.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger plugs into your car's cigarette lighter port.

The projector is straightforward to set up and use, and you don't need to mount it on the ceiling or the other side of the room; as it uses UST tech, you can position it just a few inches away from the wall and still get up to a 120-inch projection.</p><p>The projector has 4K as well as Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in addition to HDR10+, and it does a fantastic job with 4K content. It gets bright enough that I didn't see any issues with it even with plenty of ambient light, and if you've already had a projector and want to switch to a brighter model or need to set up a home theater, this is one of the best models available today. The LTV-3000 Pro retails for $3,999, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F?">Prime Day it's available for $2,449</a> — its lowest price yet.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.87%;"><img id="SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC" name="ltv-3000-pro.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPrRfaEbrrWAyRWNjarejC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The LTV-3000 Pro has outstanding picture quality, and you can easily use it in a room with lots of ambient light.

In that case, I'd recommend getting the VisionMaster Pro 2; it is considerably brighter, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valerion-VisionMaster-Pro2-Triple-Projector/dp/B0DSBYCZJR">coming in at $2,389 on Amazon</a>, it is also a good deal. </p><p><strong>Alternative deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong>XGIMI Aura 2 </strong></a><strong>—</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK"><strong> $2,149 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5d23d16d-2c61-45f8-b393-4f66f974435c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,799 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$2449">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The only issue with the LTV-3000 Pro is that it doesn't get Android TV installed out of the box. Instead, you get a dongle in the package. This way is honestly better as you can use your own solution — I use the projector with the Shield TV Pro. Other than that, it doesn't have any shortcomings.</p><p>The 2,000 lumen brightness ensures the LTV-3000 Pro gets bright enough even with ambient light, and this hasn't been a problem whatsoever in the year I used the projector. Color quality is outstanding thanks to the laser light source, and it excels at 4K Dolby Vision and HDR content. The built-in sound is great in its own right, but I suggest using it with a soundbar to unlock its full potential — I connected it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-smart-ultra-dolby-atmos-soundbar-ideal-rocking-out">Bose's excellent Smart Home Ultra soundbar</a> and Bass Module 700 subwoofer.</p><p>I use the LTV-3000 Pro with a 90-inch projector, but it goes up to 150 inches, making it the ideal choice if you're just getting started with a home theater. The projector is clearly built to last, and the picture quality gives it a definite edge over most models in this segment. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR13MB4F">deal pricing of $2,449</a> makes it that much more alluring; it's still quite a lot of cash, but you're also getting one of the best 4K UST projectors available today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thanks to GaN III, it doesn't run too hot, and at the same time, the charger maintains a tiny footprint. The Voltme 100W GaN III Charger has one USB Type-A and two USB Type-C ports. It supports QC 3.0, PD 3.0, and PPS fast charging, making it the ideal charger for just about any device, be it a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.</p><p>There are very few reasons why you'd want to skip this deal. The only explanation would be that you either already have such a powerful charger or you're searching for something higher than 100W.</p><p>Don't forget that a charger like this requires a compatible charger to tap into that max 100W charging speed. In fact, any charger over 60W needs a 5A e-marked cable. If that went over your head, don't worry.
