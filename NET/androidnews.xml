                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Samsung has reportedly started pausing and removing its One UI 8 OTA update from Galaxy S23 series users.</li><li>Another report says it's also removed it from servers for European and Indian users.</li><li>Samsung hasn't stated why it's paused the update, like it's done with S22 and S24 series, but users have started wondering if battery problems are the reason.</li></ul><p>Samsung's One UI 8 spree on older devices hits yet another snag, as reports fly in about the Galaxy S23 series.</p><p>Reports are coming in from a couple of different angles; however, the first was cited by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-is-the-latest-to-suffer-a-one-ui-8-0-release-suspension/">SamMobile</a> earlier today (Oct 21). The publication states that the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S23 series has seemingly disappeared from Samsung's servers. While the post speculates this One UI 8 suspension may not last long, nothing's clear. Samsung's software is no longer accessible by users' devices; however, it hasn't explained why.</p><p>The publication highlights that Galaxy S23 users who've gotten the update (it's been out for a few weeks now) haven't reported major issues.</p><p>Curiously, X user Akhilesh Kumar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Koram_Akhilesh/status/1980536427017564172">reported on the same situation</a>, stating the patch was pulled from servers concerning European and Indian users. The safest bet right now is that Samsung's discovered an issue with its software and pulled it before it affected too many people.</p><p>A few users on X replied to the post, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/samsung_now389/status/1980570228921942173">wondering if others</a> were having battery drain problems. Some with a Galaxy S23 state their battery is performing more or less the same as it has been. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BoogieD262/status/1980558886668284052">was one user who reported</a> that their Galaxy S23 FE <em>is </em>struggling with battery life and that they can't use their phone for "more than three hours."</p><p>Perhaps this is the issue Samsung has identified, but it's probably best not to wonder and face reality: One UI 8 is suspended for the S23 series.</p><h2 id="what-s-really-going-on-2">What's really going on?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-display-home-screen-01.jpg" alt="The home screen of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>What's (not-so) funny is that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-early-one-ui-8-on-galaxy-s23-android-16-expands">started rolling out its One UI 8 update</a> to the Galaxy S23 series on September 29. The patch was ahead of schedule, as we weren't expecting the Android 16-based OS to arrive until October. Galaxy S23 users were given a huge 3GB download, packed with the latest goodies, security features, and more. The rollout appeared fine, as, again, reports were riddled with problems.</p><p>However, that's no longer the case, as Samsung yanked it, which it's already done with the Galaxy S22 series. This strangely happened a week after the S22 series started downloading the new patch, indicating Samsung spotted something amiss quite quickly.</p><p>Nearly a week ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-halts-one-ui-8-update-for-galaxy-s24-in-south-korea">Samsung suspended</a> its One UI 8 update on the Galaxy S24 series. The suspension was spotted for consumers with the models in South Korea first, as its OTA file vanished. Reports added that the S24 FE was roped into the pause, as well. Much like the S23, Samsung has refrained from stating why it's stopped the rollout, despite previously rolling through its scheduled plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The main highlight states users can soon expect Live Updates to bring "key travel journeys that include flights, train trips, and events."</p><p>Google also details that it's bringing an update that moves Gmail closer to Wallet for passes.

These alerts were constant updates that users could lean on about their train rides, knowing whether or not it's delayed, on time, or otherwise.

They're not designed to stay secure and withstand sweat or water like a dedicated pair of fitness earbuds. Fitness buffs will turn to alternatives instead, which are expensive.</p><p>Our favorite fitness earbuds are the in-ear Powerbeats Pro 2 at $250 and the open-air <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review">Shokz OpenFit 2</a> at $180. While both are great, their price tags might be tough to justify for people who already own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. The question is: do you need to spend that much to get a pair of Android earbuds that'll handle the gym, the track, and everything in between?</p><p>To find out, I tested Belkin's new SoundForm ActiveFit earbuds — an intriguing pair of fitness buds priced at just $42. That's a fraction of the cost of a Powerbeats Pro 2 set. Even as a Powerbeats enjoyer, I wasn't convinced my preferred running earbuds were more than five times better than the SoundForm ActiveFit.</p><p>After using the SoundForm ActiveFit and the Powerbeats Pro 2 side by side, Belkin's offering blew me away. There are clear shortcomings, as you'd expect, but the value proposition for the SoundForm ActiveFit is readily apparent.</p><h2 id="how-the-belkin-soundform-activefit-cover-the-basics-2">How the Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit cover the basics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-1" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Normally, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend buying a pair of earbuds this cheap. You get what you pay for where audio is concerned, although the gap between budget and premium earbuds seems to be closing more by the day. It's a completely different story for workout earbuds — sound quality is lower on the list of key features.</p><p>While crisp vocals and booming bass are always appreciated, they're not necessities for fitness earbuds. Instead, traits such as water and sweat resistance, battery life, comfort and fit, and awareness loom large. The last point is crucial. Awareness is needed for safety while running, walking, or biking in public areas, and that's why people often turn to earbuds with ANC and transparency mode.</p><p>Letting the right sounds in ensures a runner or biker is tuned into their surroundings. The problem? ANC and transparency are quite hard to find on budget earbuds. That's why I was surprised to see "Hear-Thru Mode" on the SoundForm ActiveFit, which uses the onboard microphones to enable passthrough sound.</p><p>It's essential for outdoor workouts, even if it's not <em>true</em> ANC or transparency mode in the conventional sense.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-4" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The next thing I look for in workout earbuds is a comfortable and secure fit. Belkin checks this box with a silicone ear hook that wraps around your ear for maximum security. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> have this too, but don't feel as stable in the ear — likely because they're a bit smaller and have a different insertion angle.</p><p>Durability and sweat-resistance are covered by an IP54 rating, matching the Beats' IPX4 liquid certification but adding dust resistance. You get nine hours of playback from the earbuds, plus another 27 hours from the charging case. The case itself has USB-C and a built-in lanyard loop, perfect for living in your gym bag.</p><h2 id="how-the-powerbeats-pro-2-justify-their-lofty-price-tag-2">How the Powerbeats Pro 2 justify their lofty price tag</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundForm ActiveFit are actually solid in terms of volume, even if the earbuds tend to get tinny at higher volumes. The default EQ profile is Belkin Signature Sound, and you can switch to Bass Boost and Balanced if you please.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend it, however, as the sound signature simply sounds off in the other modes. One boosts the bass at the expense of everything else, and the other cuts it out almost entirely.</p><p>This is where the Powerbeats Pro 2 comparatively shine. They're better-sounding with a balanced profile that borrows sound signature and hardware from the famed AirPods Pro 2. Additionally, their on-earbuds controls are better, with Beats providing physical buttons on each bud plus a volume rocker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also add active noise-canceling, transparency mode, and an Adaptive EQ setting. Battery life is slightly longer, at 10 hours from the earbuds on a single charge.

You can configure this to automatically switch to one of the three alternate display options — color paper, ink paper, and max ink — or just choose via pop-up box that appears when you slide the key upward.</p><p>That makes it handy for switching between screen modes when you're just in the mood to read. Ink paper mode is best for reading books, while color paper mode is best for things like manga or comics. Max ink mode is for those times you want to unplug and get a bit of digital detox in for a while, as it turns on extra battery saver and shuts down most apps.</p><p>The camera is also quite good for the price range, offering punchy shots with good color and nice dynamic range. Plus, the phone ships with Andorid 15 under the hood.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-06" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER apps in Max Ink Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Derrek noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G review</a>, this phone isn't a powerhouse and won't be impressing anyone with its performance. You shouldn't ever expect a $199 phone to be as fast as a $1,000 phone, but it's still worth noting before jumping in.</p><p>And as much as I love NXTPAPER technology, the screen is a little difficult to see outside during those extra bright days. It's something you can get used to and may be a worthy trade-off if you prefer reading indoors but, again, well worth noting if you're a person who spends a lot of time looking at their phone outside.</p><p>Even with those downsides, it's hard to say no to this phone for just $199.

And I already know I'll wear these more than my Ray-Bans.</p><p><em>You</em> may not need the Vanguard's IP67 water resistance for sweaty workouts, 6db-louder speakers to counterbalance wind, or an extra hour of battery life for longer activities. They're not the right fit for using indoors, with no Transitions or clear lenses; nor is the Oakley Spheara style suited to "blending in" like Ray-Ban Wayfarers.</p><p>I don't depend on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> for every occasion, as Meta would like; it's only during workouts or hikes, when my phone is an unwelcome distraction, that Meta's AI answers, hands-free videos, and workout playlists really compel me.</p><p>While I was impressed during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 testing</a>, they're still better suited for casual wear. With the Oakley Meta Vanguard, it's clear that these are the better fit for runners, hikers, cyclists, or extreme sports fans — despite some caveats I'll explain below.</p><h2 id="i-actually-prefer-the-oakley-meta-vanguard-design-2">I actually prefer the Oakley Meta Vanguard design</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-on-face-2" alt="A photo of the author wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard with a valley behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Smart glasses are noticeably thicker than normal glasses to fit the cameras, speakers, and battery, as well as bear the weight. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)s aren't <em>bad</em> in this respect, but every non-techie I've had try them on says they like the features but not the chunky look on their face.</p><p>Most Oakley sunglasses, on the other hand, are massive and flashy, with a thick nose guard and top bar; this gives the Meta Vanguards leeway to be big without seeming out of place. They're twice as heavy as the Spheara design that inspired them, but I feel sporty wearing them, instead of dorky.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses from the back, with the arms extended toward the camera and the back of the lenses in the center." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-front-view" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard of the front lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-right-side-view-Oakley-logo" alt="A top-side view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses on a wooden table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-nose-pads" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's nose pad and Meta logo between the lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-left-arm" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's left arm showing the Oakley name and manufacturing info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You'll have to accept that these glasses weigh a lot, putting pressure on your nose. But unlike with Ray-Bans that need to be fitted tightly to your face to avoid sliding, the Vanguard's built-in nose pads prevent sliding, even with sweat and the up-down motion of running.</p><p>Still, it's a pressure point where 66g of weight presses down, especially for any downhill running or hiking. It won't affect you much after a single workout, and cyclists should be okay unless they're bouncing up and down mountain paths for hours. But after a long hike on Saturday and a two-hour run on Sunday, my nose feels sore and needs a break.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-top-down-view" alt="A top view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses showing the top bar and arms." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some people won't mind the extra weight for the best smart glasses experience, while others will find them cumbersome.

cool if Meta gave the Vanguard <strong>landscape</strong> photos and videos. I know that portrait mode is what's in vogue for Meta's apps or TikTok, but the GoPro athletic crowd wants as wide and immersive a view as possible. Even if portrait is the default, Meta should allow us to switch perspectives with a voice command or button tap.</p><p>I also recorded videos using 1080p at 30/60FPS and 3K at 30FPS at various points during a 13-mile run. I can't embed them here, but I can assure you that it's difficult to tell them apart! The 3K view is slightly more immersive, but more prone to jittering from fast movement; I preferred the 60FPS mode, which looks wondefully smooth and creates the feeling of gliding down my running path.</p><p>My only real problem was that the Oakleys' revamped speakers are so loud and rich that your music is audible in videos; I've learned to pause my music before recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Vanguard's slow-motion videos are best suited to extreme sports </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vanguard has four different stabilization settings — Auto, Low, Medium, and High — based on how much you want to balance out or preserve rapid movement. I didn't get to play with these settings too much, but it's great to see Meta putting this power in the hands of users, and the High setting is, again, buttery smooth.</p><p>Of the Vanguard's two new video modes (slow-mo and hyperlapse), I absolutely loved creating hyperlapse videos of my hike, fast-forwarding through my slow climb down a steep hill and then winding down the trail path. It creates a visual snippet of your activity that you can pair with your Garmin stats or custom music, great for sharing on social media if that's your thing.</p><h2 id="garmin-integration-is-surprisingly-useful-with-some-hiccups-2">Garmin integration is surprisingly useful, with some hiccups</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P8jsRxUgQ5dsoGG2gVPEFf" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Forerunner-970" alt="A photo of Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and a Garmin Forerunner 970 smartwatch in front of them on a wooden picnic table, showing post-workout stats." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8jsRxUgQ5dsoGG2gVPEFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Plenty of Garmin users are skeptical about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/c/who-we-work-with/oakley-meta/">Oakley-Garmin integration</a>, which lets you say "Hey Meta, what's my average/current pace?" and have Meta AI pull that data in real time from your compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. It's partially due to mistrust of Meta, and partially because they can just glance down at their wrist for the data.</p><p>I plan to write a more in-depth test of Garmin and Strava integration on these glasses, but for now, I've been impressed by how speedily Meta AI can pull your live information like current/ average pace, elevation gain, cadence, running power, HR zone, and other stats within a second of asking.</p><p>Meta AI can't recognize every stat that Garmin tracks, but I still appreciate getting the highlights without have to search through data fields on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-with-Meta-AI-workout-summary" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses sitting on a treadmill next to a phone showing a Meta AI workout summary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not especially fun to pant out "Hey Meta" before every request, but at least the "Respond without 'Hey Meta'" setting lets you ask follow-ups easily. I hope that Meta AI eventually listens for custom commands like "Pace" or "Heart Rate" <em>without</em> the wake word.</p><p>Meta also created an Autocapture mode that uses your Garmin stats to record a 5-second clip every time you hit a mile marker or a sudden change in intensity. The concept is great for public events or deserted trails, but I quickly realized automatic recording can be <em>mortifying</em> if someone's passing by at the wrong moment, so be careful with it.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-vanguard-is-built-to-last-2">Oakley Meta Vanguard is built to last</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uGGDgrRTGWjupTMeuVNGF" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-02" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uGGDgrRTGWjupTMeuVNGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta says Oakley Meta Vanguard lasts six hours with music streaming, or about 16.6% per hour, slightly better than Ray-Ban Gen 2s (five hours). That's about on pace with what I've experienced, but I don't <em>only</em> stream music; I'm also taking frequent photos or videos, which burn through battery much more quickly.</p><p>Here's a better barometer for battery life: During a 2-hour run, Garmin Autocapture took 24 five-second videos, while I recorded another seven 30-second videos for my video stabilization testing; I also listened constantly to music and asked Meta AI for Garmin stats about 20 times. I ended at 49% battery, putting me on pace for 4 hours with <strong>heavy</strong> usage.</p><p>If I chilled out with the commands and videos, I think Oakley Meta Vanguard could last long enough to accompany a marathon run, or a 100km ride for a competent cyclist.</p><p>Even if the battery capacity fades with time, Oakley Meta Vanguards have a really solid baseline, and I appreciate that we get IP67 dust and water resistance to withstand sweaty workouts or accidental drops on dusty trails. My IPX4 Ray-Ban Metas always had me worried.</p><p>Overall, I genuinely like my Oakley Meta Vanguards despite the tradeoffs.

However, this South Korean report suggests that Samsung's advancements may have pushed the Exynos 2600 over the speed of Apple's and Qualcomm's latest chips. The report compares the chip to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, purporting that Samsung's is roughly 29% better in graphical performance and 30% better in NPU.</p><p>When it comes to Apple's A19 Pro, rumors state the Exynos 2600 is ~75% graphically and potentially ~14% better in multi-core (CPU) performance.</p><p>These rumors reiterate what we've heard before, that the Exynos 2600 is built on Samsung's 2nm process. AI is another major part of the chip that's reportedly going to shine through on the Galaxy S26 series. The publication claims that Samsung "focused heavily on AI performance," seeking to surpass that of Apple's devices.</p><p>Such a report makes it seem like Samsung is going to utilize its chip in as many places as possible, but that might not be the case.

It’s built around an AI server-grade liquid that stays stable from -60°C to 108°C, paired with a 24,000rpm fan, a ceramic micro-pump, and a four-layer heat dissipation setup. Oh, and the liquid actually moves visibly inside a translucent ring on the back.</p><p>Under the hood, the RedMagic 11 Pro packs Qualcomm’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, backed by up to 24GB of LPDDR5T RAM and UFS 4.1 Pro storage. RedMagic also threw in its own RedCore R4 chip to handle touch and graphics optimization, and even a PC emulator in the China version.</p><h2 id="the-trade-off-a-smaller-global-battery-2">The trade-off: A smaller global battery?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Battery life is another flex point — an 8,000mAh cell that supports 120W wired and 80W wireless charging. RedMagic says it can last over 13 hours in MOBA games. The tradeoff for the upcoming global release, though, is that international models might get a smaller battery to comply with regional safety standards, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Global-release-confirmed-RedMagic-11-Pro-to-launch-internationally-but-with-major-battery-caveat.1140945.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>.</p><p>Up front, you get a 6.8-inch BOE X10 AMOLED display with 2,688 × 1,216 resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, and an under-display camera. The display also supports eye protection tech for marathon gaming sessions.</p><p>Cameras are surprisingly capable for a gaming phone — dual 50MP shooters and advanced streaming support up to 8K60Hz.</p><p>The RedMagic 11 Pro starts at 4,999 RMB (around $680) in China and comes in black, silver, and transparent editions. The global launch is set for November 3, where we’ll see if RedMagic brings all its cooling tricks overseas or keeps some of the magic exclusive to China.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update specifically concerns Meta's AI characters and the personal chats users can have with them, one-on-one. For Teen Accounts, Meta states parents will have three new capabilities accessible, beginning with the ability to disable AI character chats completely.</p><p>Instead of having these characters for questions and answers, Meta states that any Teen Account with that disabled will still have access to its AI assistant. Through the assistant, the AI will tune its answers to be educational and age-appropriate for teenagers.</p><p>Meta is also planning to bring the option for parents to block specific AI characters that their teenager has access to. This would serve as an alternative to disabling the feature completely. Lastly, Meta plans to give parents better insight into the conversations their teens are having with AI characters and the company's AI assistant.</p><p>The post adds that these three planned upgrades come off the back of "concerns" parents have expressed about their children interacting with AI chatbots.</p><h2 id="protections-for-younger-users-2">Protections for younger users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:689px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh" name="meta-instagram-parental-settings-approval-request.jpg" alt="Supervised teen accounts on Instagram must request approval when changing settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="689" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company states that it seeks to have guardrails in place so parents can be further informed and can have the right discussions with their teens, if need be.</p><p>These AI/parental tools will start on Instagram in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia (English users) "early next year."</p><p>Teen Accounts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">rolled out around this time last year</a>, as a restricted version of Instagram where parents can monitor and control what their child sees. Teens under 16 years of age qualify for a Teen Account, and these profiles are defaulted to "private," forcing users to approve users who attempt to follow them. Sensitive content in the Explore tab and Reels is much harder to come by, as well.</p><p>Meta rolled these out, as previously stated, in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia before other countries last year. It hit Europe two months later, before arriving globally the following year. There's a chance we'll see a similar rollout to this updated vision Meta has for parents and their kids.</p><p>Just last month, Instagram's AI gained the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">ability to detect teen accounts</a> even if they've lied about their age. If the AI determines a user is underage, it will automatically switch their account to a Teen Account. This update also brought notifications to parents in Canada.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, most phones I used in 2025 did a great job delivering on both fronts; devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> have incredible cameras that run tings around what Google and Samsung have to offer, and they last longer.</p><p>Interestingly, this year's launches have been characterized by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">mainstream use of silicon battery tech.</a> This has allowed Chinese phone manufacturers to predominantly use bigger batteries without any material difference in size or weight. The result is that most phones I used in 2025 came with 6,000mAh batteries, lasting a day and a half without breaking a sweat.</p><p>In fact, battery anxiety is a thing of the past, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, there isn't a single phone where the battery didn't comfortably last a day. What's notable is that Chinese phone brands are now starting to add even bigger batteries in their phones, leading to devices with 7,000mAh or larger batteries.</p><p>The result is that we are finally at a point where phones can reliably last two days between charges. Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/i-used-the-vivo-x300-and-x300-pro">X300 Pro</a> has a 6,510mAh battery, and the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max and Find X9 Pro have even bigger 7,500mAh batteries. In fact, most Chinese brands are going this route with their latest phones, and while I was initially worried that the thin phone trend would catch on, I'm glad to see that hasn't been the case.</p><p>Clearly, this is made possible by adding a mix of a silicon-carbon in the anode, and while 2025 phones only had a 10% silicon content in the batteries, brands are increasingly using higher ratios of silicon, and that's how we are getting bigger batteries in phones that aren't any heavier or bulkier than their predecessors.</p><p>One downside to this is that not all global models are getting the same battery size. While Vivo sells the X300 Pro with a 6,510mAh battery in Asian markets, the Austrian unit has a significantly smaller 5,440mAh unit, which is just annoying. I'm using the Austrian unit of the X300 Pro, and while I still get a day's use easily, it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the Find X9 Pro, Xiaomi 17 Pro Max, and iQOO 15 should have the same battery size in all countries, giving these devices a distinct edge over their rivals. Another factor to consider is the charging tech; while Chinese brands dabbled with 120W and 150W standards, the industry has settled around 90W and 100W charging, and this is again down to the use of silicon batteries.</p><p>From conversations with device makers, it's evident that 90W is seen as the sweet spot these days; it is fast enough that even a 7,000mAh battery is able to charge in an hour, and it doesn't lead to any unnecessary battery degradation. What I like even better is that most Chinese phones now offer USB PD integration at least up to 50W, and this makes charging these battery behemoths easier.</p><p>Like last year, the battery advancements are limited to Chinese manufacturers, with Apple, Google, and Samsung largely unbothered by silicon battery tech. While Google went with a slightly bigger battery on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it's clear that these brands have no intention of using silicon-based anodes on their devices anytime soon, handing over all the momentum to their Chinese rivals.</p><p>As much as I'd like to see a Pixel or Galaxy phone that lasts two days between charges, it's evident that we are still a few years away from that. Thankfully, that isn't the case with the latest Chinese phones, and with these devices set to debut globally in the coming weeks, you don't have to wait too long if you're looking to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Normally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is a good bit cheaper now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro</a> is here.

However, there are some good reasons to buy a relatively new model versus a brand new one, though.</p><p><strong>You will save some money</strong>. Once stock of a new model arrives, retailers want to move out all the existing stock, meaning they need to catch your eye, and the very best way to do that is to cut the price.</p><p><strong>It's still new</strong>. When you buy a 2024 phone in 2025, it's probably still going to be brand new. That means you'll get the full warranty, and the battery won't have a year's worth of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">wear and tear</a>. If it lasts 3 years when you bought it in 2024, it will last three years when you buy it in 2025.</p><p><strong>No big improvements</strong>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore's law</a> isn't dead, but it's on life support. Before we'll gigantic shift with much faster or more efficient hardware, science has to figure out where to put it and how to do it. It will, but for now, the newer stuff is only incrementally better than the older stuff.</p><p><strong>You don't care about the new features</strong>. You know that a newer model Pixel is going to come with special <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI </a>tricks that older Pixels don't have. Some will never come to last year's model. If you don't care about them, don't pay extra for them.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-to-buy-a-new-model"><span>When to buy a new model</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-back-01" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless there is a serious manufacturing flaw, you can't go wrong buying the newest model. You'll pay for the privilege, though. Here's when you should buy the newest, and why.</p><p><strong>The price</strong>. Normally, you'll pay more, but big sales events can change that. Decide on a number you're okay with; let's say $150. When the new model is less than $150 more than the older one, go for it.</p><p><strong>Support lifetime</strong>. Every good company now offers multiple years of software support and updates for a new phone. A phone built in 2024 that comes with five years of support reaches end-of-life in 2029. One from 2025 lasts until 2030. If you plan on keeping it around for a while, this matters.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer incentives</strong>. Often, a new model will come with things like a better trade-in policy, a discount on headphones, or even a great deal on other brand-new products like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch</a>. Consider what else you'll be buying, what you have to trade in, and what the total price will be once it's all tallied up.</p><p><strong>New features</strong>. Those Gemini AI tricks I mentioned above? You might really want one or more of them. If the only way you'll ever get them is to buy a new phone, well, you're going to have to do it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-you-re-winning-either-way"><span>You're winning either way</span></h3><p>There is no right or wrong answer for this one, because each of us wants something different. All I can do is tell you what I think and why, using that same Pixel as my example</p><p><strong>Today</strong>, I would buy a Pixel 9 Pro over a Pixel 10 Pro. There are no real differences that matter to me, and I like saving money. That all changes if they are only $100 apart. I'd take the 10 Pro in a minute. Maybe something new will come along that requires the small hardware bump, and I'll have it, and I'll probably be able to find a coupon that saves me money on a charger or something.</p><p>I buy a phone for myself every two years, and I usually buy a model from the year before. This time, I didn't <em><strong>because</strong></em> of a big sale: I got my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Moto Razr </a>for a few dollars more than the 2023 would have cost me.</p><p>Shopping wisely and doing a bit of research saved me money. It can save you money, too.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9939d19b-5e07-40ea-8e71-baeba2ee80e1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A well-rounded flagship</strong></em></p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro takes the same design from the Pixel 9 Pro and overhauls the internals.

Among its advancements, the OnePlus 15 has been confirmed to feature a massive 7,300mAh Glacier Battery.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Artificial intelligence wants to be everywhere, including on your wrists and in your workouts. Compared to generative AI "slop" like photo and video creation, there's a case to be made for AI infiltrating your workout and fitness plans. Not everyone has access to a personal trainer, sports physician, or physical therapist easily — in fact, few do — and that's why an accurate and accessible AI feature could fill the gap.</p><p>Of course, that puts a lot of pressure on a piece of tech known to be fallible. Anytime your health is involved, you need to be careful what  devices and features you trust. Whether we like it or not, AI is coming for the health space — Garmin, Strava, Apple, Samsung, Google, and many other brands are rolling out AI-powered features now.</p><p>Suunto upgraded its Suunto Coach, an AI-assisted workout helper, to support AI-generated training plans over the summer. I've been testing them with the newly-announced Vertical 2 adventure watch, and I'm intrigued for two reasons. For one, Suunto Coach and My plan are free. Another is that they're actually using AI, which not every workout feature branded as such can claim.</p><p>So, is it any good? Here are my early thoughts after training with the Vertical 2 for two weeks and setting up an AI workout plan.</p><h2 id="setting-up-a-custom-my-plan-with-suunto-coach-2">Setting up a custom My plan with Suunto Coach</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KcwWD3QTwyKy6HFoLXJPf8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-4" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcwWD3QTwyKy6HFoLXJPf8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After logging a bunch of running and walking workouts with the Suunto Vertical 2, I went to set up the AI-generated training plan with Suunto Coach. The process starts with a brief questionnaire for context as to your training goals and capabilities.</p><p>Suunto will ask how many hours you are currently training in a week, and then ask your maximum time commitment. You'll have the chance pick a dedicated day for long runs, or state a preference for strength and cross-training workouts. Finally, you'll share your race goal and terrain.</p><p>The questions might vary based on your training plan. I selected the "Get fast for 5km" training plan, as I'm more worried about cutting my 5K time than increasing mileage. I answered the questionnaire accordingly, with my goal being to achieve a personal best on a flat and fast course.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w2CeMMqzSxDuSi4dfFovQ6" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-Screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots of the Suunto app showing Suunto Coach and My Plan AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2CeMMqzSxDuSi4dfFovQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From there, Suunto will do some AI processing behind the scenes, developing your training plan. This will take a while, often between 10 and 30 minutes. The good news is you only have to do this once for each plan. Using the context based on your answers, Suunto will come up with a personalized training regimen.</p><p>The initial approach reminded me of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Samsung's Running Coach</a>, a similar feature that includes a brief questionnaire to get a picture of your capabilities. There looks to be more AI processing going on here with Suunto Coach. It takes more time to create a training plan and offers more variety than Running Coach, which is more rigid with fixed time and distance-based running levels.</p><p>That's what intrigues me about Suunto Coach and the AI-generated training plans, which are called "My plan" and are still in beta. For better or worse, they're really using AI. Meanwhile, AI isn't making a meaningful impact on Running Coach or Apple's Workout Buddy. The latter essentially just recites live stats you're already used to seeing on your Apple Watch.</p><h2 id="a-workout-tool-with-potential-and-some-quirks-2">A workout tool with potential, and some quirks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JzF9d4sFHYeahqxzRpEot8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-3" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzF9d4sFHYeahqxzRpEot8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once the training plan generated, I saw immediate potential and a few oddities. The plan does seem personalized and thoughtful, with weekly targets, long-term goals, and instructions specific to individual workouts. It does a fantastic job at taking best practices for running and applying them to a specific plan.</p><p>For instance, my plan included strategic rest days and an easy, low-mileage week that followed each pair of hard training weeks. The 10-week set prescribed six weeks of intense workouts and three weeks of recovery running, including a taper for the final week. It's all designed to maximize performance while also managing miles and avoiding overuse injuries.</p><p>These are well-known running tips and tricks that even experienced runners struggle to implement. It's great to see them in a thorough training plan that takes the strategy off the runner and onto AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b7uuEMHfqUsapcosSruxF6" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-Screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots of the Suunto app showing Suunto Coach and My Plan AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7uuEMHfqUsapcosSruxF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, some things could use a tweak. The time, mileage, and pace targets for each workout didn't seem to align with the body of work I had already tracked on the Vertical 2. This leads me to believe the AI brains of Suunto Coach is using the questionnaire more than your prior stats when making a plan. It is supposed to evolve on the fly, and it is still a beta.</p><p>I also found it weird that the AI workout plan randomly inserted a cross-country skiing workout during week eight. I've never cross-country skied, and it's not the easiest sport to try for the first time, so it's an interesting choice.</p><h2 id="suunto-coach-feels-best-as-a-guide-not-a-plan-2">Suunto Coach feels best as a guide, not a plan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="THbGHVdpVPT4vn8rjFcYn8" name="Suunto-AI-Coach-6" alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 paired with a training plan generated by AI in the Suunto app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THbGHVdpVPT4vn8rjFcYn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I plan to stick with Suunto Coach, despite the room for improvement. It seems genuinely helpful for training as long as you don't take it too seriously.</p><p>By that, I mean following its recommendations <em>generally</em> and not to the letter. In my case, I'll follow its broad plan for weekly mileage, workout mix, and training load — but avoid hitting an exact mileage or pace target.</p><p>This is a free tool included with Suunto watches, and it'll definitely be handy for the right runner. You just need to take its tips with a grain of salt, just like any AI feature.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="36e4f4f3-1a69-49ff-85eb-13ae5f1b5cd7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6j4KPd2Q5AUeWzDP9jtBwf.jpg' alt="The Suunto Vertical 2 in a white press render.

It features a good suite of cameras, a long lasting battery, Android 14 with some key improvements from prior generations, and a 6.7-inch OLED screen that users love. Plus, it comes with the stylus, a fingerprint sensor, and the classic vegan leather backing that makes Motorola phones feel great to hold.</p><p>The thing we like most about the Moto G Stylus lineup is its price tag, and it is worth noting that the 2025 was launched this year with the same $400 sticker price.

It teases that the two main features were developed using "peer-reviewed studies and continuous algorithm refinements." Seeing as Oura is interested in offering Preventive Health assistance daily, the new features begin with "Cumulative Stress."</p><p>Oura states the purpose of this new feature is for users to understand how stress affects their bodies. More specifically, Cumulative Stress will monitor and inform users on how their bodies "respond to chronic stress over time." If left untamed, long-term stress can lead to severe problems, such as fatigue, burnout, and even illness, according to Oura's research.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="YsCuXRoopkxwfxk5hTMVw7" name="oura-app-cumulative-stress-example" alt="Oura is rolling out "Cumulative Stress" and a Stress Management window, informing users about how stressed their bodies are and how it is affecting them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YsCuXRoopkxwfxk5hTMVw7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cumulative Stress will also break down where stress is affecting them.

Oura Members participating in this new Blood Pressure Profile Study in Oura Labs will more deeply understand their heart health. The press release details that users can receive alerts if the system detects they're at risk of hypertension.</p><p>This "reading" is a mixture of your Oura Ring data, short questionnaire answers about family history, medication, and lifestyle habits. You'll see an alert about your hypertension risk after answering these questions, which Oura states could fall within any of the following ranges: No signs, Moderate, or Major.</p><p>The Blood Pressure Profile will continue to monitor your body for any changes. Oura adds that this feature "passively" works in the background to detect potential signs of hypertension to educate users about their heart health. If something is there, or something doesn't sit right with you, book an appointment with your doctor. It mentions that, in conjunction with the FDA and following approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Oura aims to detect "early signs" before they become serious.</p><p>This Blood Pressure Profile Study will arrive in Oura Labs for Members in the U.S. "in the coming months."</p><h2 id="cycle-insights-in-app-ui-updates-2">Cycle Insights & in-app UI updates</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="bGqCe3FGdHGZsXMKx2YVw7" name="oura-app-cycle-insights-updates" alt="The Oura app has updated its Cycle Insights to give women a more intuitive view on their periods and fertile windows." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGqCe3FGdHGZsXMKx2YVw7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura is rounding out its two major Preventive Health capability updates with an in-app UI overhaul.</p><p>This rework regards the Oura app's Today screen first. The new Today tab will work to better inform users about their well-being before engaging in daily activities and decisions. Oura says the highlight for this new tab is the "One Big Thing," an overview that brings relevant scores, insights, and Discoveries to the surface. Next, the My Health tab has been updated to provide a "clearer view" of their long-term health.</p><p>A new Habits and Routines section is said to "connect daily behaviors to measurable health metrics." Then, there's the Vitals tab, which is an at-a-glance view of your personal core health pillars: sleep, stress, and cardiovascular trends. Users can take a walk through their personal changes, seeing how they've (hopefully) improved in these core areas over the past few days, weeks, months, or even years.</p><p>This UI update isn't only for the app's tabs, but also for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-app-advisor-labs-test-launch">Cycle Insights</a>. This feature is now expanded from one-month insights to a 12-month window about a woman's period and fertile window predictions. This feature is for Oura Members, just as a side note.</p><p>Oura states, "instead of waiting 60 nights, Oura Members will now receive personalized cycle phase and prediction data from a single night of sleep data."</p><p>The Oura app redesign and the updates to Cycle Insights are rolling out globally to users "in the coming weeks" on Android and iOS.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like what UGREEN is doing with NAS servers; the brand made its debut in this category just a year and a half ago, but it made great momentum thanks to powerful hardware and highly customizable software. Of course, the brand's willingness to allow its customers to eschew its own software and run TrueNAS Scale has endeared it to power users, and this is one of the key reasons why I continue to use the DXP6800 Pro.</p><p>UGREEN is now turning its attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-nas">budget NAS</a> category with the introduction of the 2-bay NASync DH2300 and 4-bay NASync DS4300 Plus. The DH2300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dh2300-nas-storage">costs just $189</a>, making it go up against the mighty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds223j-review">DiskStation DS223j</a>. I suggested the DD223j for anyone looking to just get started with NAS servers; it's a great starting point thanks to the affordability and software, and now the DH2300 is proving to be a legitimate alternative.</p><p>The 4-bay DH4300 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Plus-4-Bay-Capacity-Diskless/dp/B0F6CSCSBL/">retails for $364 on Amazon</a>, and it's already seeing decent momentum, becoming the number one release in this category on the retailer — no small feat. Both the DH2300 and DH4300 Plus have a sleeker design than UGREEN's traditional NAS models, and the hardware is better than just about any product in this category.</p><p>The 2-bay DH2300 has Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and is powered by a Rockchip RK3576. It has 4GB of RAM, which is four times what you get on the DS223j, and there's a 32GB SSD pre-installed that lets you install the software. You get USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI connectivity, and as a starter NAS, there really is a lot to like.</p><p>The 4-bay DH4300 Plus comes with 8GB of RAM, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and gets USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI ports. Interestingly, both models accommodate 30TB drives, and I'm using Seagate's 30TB IronWolf Pro drives in each. I'm just getting started with these NAS servers, and I'll share detailed testing notes after using the products for a while.</p><p>But what's of immediate interest is the value; both the DS2300 and DH4300 Plus make it easier than ever to start using a NAS. and the 2-bay DH2300 in particular is turning out to be a standout choice.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="37beb5c7-853e-4b8b-98ef-d274ff864137">            <a href="https://nas.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dh2300-nas-storage" data-model-name="UGREEN DH2300" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:108.90%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8cpc5FQsuPzwC3eag3VkR.jpg' alt="UGREEN DH2300"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">UGREEN DH2300</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The DH2300 has a modern design, better hardware than any other entry-level NAS, and great software. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tri-folding design gives the product a unique edge against regular foldables, and having used the phone for a considerable amount of time, it's astonishing how normal it is in regular use.</p><p>I thought it would be more of a tech demo than an actual product, but that isn't the case at all — the Mate XT is usable as a daily driver, and I've done just that. The fact that the phone unfolds to a tablet-sized panel is just wild, and the novelty doesn't really wear thin.</p><p>With Huawei leading the fray, it isn't astonishing that other brands are looking to get in on the action. Samsung is touted to launch its own take on a tri-folding device dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold, and with leaks pointing to an imminent release, here's what I want to see in the phone.</p><h2 id="a-design-that-isn-t-cumbersome-2">A design that isn't cumbersome</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung did a good job overhauling the design of its foldables with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and I want the tri-folding device to share the same aesthetic. The Z Fold 7 is a delight to hold and use thanks to its sleek design, and it makes a genuine difference over the likes of the Z Fold 6 and its predecessors. It's just as thin and light as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, and it wasn't until I used the Fold 7 next to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold that I realized how much of a tangible difference there is this year.</p><p>Huawei is no stranger to making sleek devices, and the Mate XT shares this trait; the tri-folding device is just 4.8mm when unfolded, and the thinness is a key factor in the device's futuristic look. Samsung needs to do the same with its tri-folding device. The Z Fold 7 being down to 215g and 4.2mm is a great starting point, and I want Samsung to use its foldable as the starting point and build on that design.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-can-take-on-the-mate-xt-2">Cameras that can take on the Mate XT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qNtwC7fk3YmMBKjsEjkD24" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNtwC7fk3YmMBKjsEjkD24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5164" height="2909" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung gave the Z Fold 7 a much-needed 200MP camera upgrade this year, allowing the foldable to take much better photos and videos. The Galaxy Z TriFold needs to have the same cameras if it needs to measure up to not just Samsung, but other foldables.</p><p>While I wasn't sure about what Huawei had to offer on the Mate XT, the cameras on the tri-folding device proved to be among the best in this category. The Mate XT continues to take standout photos and videos, and I never got the feeling that I'm being limited by the cameras on the device.</p><p>Although foldables are all about the added real estate, the fact that the Galaxy Z TriFold might cost over $3,000 means it needs to have stellar cameras — no two ways about it. Samsung has shown that it can deliver in this area this year, and we'll just need to wait and see if it manages to do the same with its tri-folding device.</p><h2 id="a-battery-that-lasts-all-day-2">A battery that lasts all day</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPwdZLE3cG4t92cKu8jKsH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPwdZLE3cG4t92cKu8jKsH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot I like about the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but a constant source of frustration is the battery life. The foldable has a smaller 4,400mAh battery, and while it manages to last a day with medium use, I find myself plugging it in before the end of the day on most days.</p><p>Most other foldables get at least a 5,000mAh battery, with Samsung being the outlier in how conservative it is in this area — even Google decided to slot in a bigger 5,015mAh battery on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold this year. All of this is to say that the Galaxy Z TriFold needs to have a bigger battery to hold its own against the Mate XT.</p><p>However, that may not be the case; leaks indicate that the tri-folding device may share the same 4,400mAh battery as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and if that turns out to be the case, it will be a letdown.</p><h2 id="a-foldable-i-actually-want-to-use-2">A foldable I actually want to use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4934px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qf2VtskxzfjTtotBpTJGAT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qf2VtskxzfjTtotBpTJGAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4934" height="2775" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another annoyance on the Z Fold 7 is just how much it wobbles when using it on a table. Because of the thinner design and the switch to bigger camera sensors, the rear cameras jut out a bit more than previous years, and with Samsung not changing the positioning of the modules, the foldable wobbles quite a lot.</p><p>Huawei and other Chinese brands mitigate this issue by using a center-mounted camera island, and Samsung needs to consider doing the same. It isn't likely that the design of the Z TriFold will diverge that much from the Z Fold 7, but even if that isn't the case, I want a phone that I can use on my desk without it constantly moving around.</p><h2 id="meaningful-software-2">Meaningful software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3753px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3753" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is doing a great job with foldable software in general, and I want to see how it utilizes the tablet-sized panel available on a tri-folding device. I'm ambivalent towards Galaxy AI, but I'll admit that Samsung is doing the right thing in highlighting what its AI suite can do front and center — unlike the Easter egg hunt that Google makes you do on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>I'm keen on seeing if any additional multi-tasking features make their way to the Z TriFold. Outside of that, I just want software that's easy to use, and has decent customizability.</p><p>A key reason why Samsung continues to dominate the foldable category is available — its phones are sold in more countries than any of its rivals. It has an insurmountable lead in North America, and with the Galaxy Z TriFold, the latest leaks indicate Samsung is readying a launch in select global regions, including the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plenty of fitness watch fans detest this trend, like my 955-wearing brother-in-law. While I'll admit I prefer AMOLED displays, the APEX 4 is a <em>great</em> watch for the holdouts.</p><p>COROS's last watch, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival"> NOMAD</a>, challenges the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a> in a narrow category: affordable, rugged hiking watches with weeks of battery life. An MIP display felt like the right fit.</p><p>The APEX 4 targets trail runners and "mountain athletes" who also care about battery life and outdoor visibility. But its $429/479 price gives it stiffer competition from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> — all AMOLED watches, and the first two with 2,000 nits for excellent readability in direct sunlight.</p><h2 id="initial-thoughts-2">Initial thoughts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c6K45y7UcyB6HYFBTLRQYn" name="COROS-APEX-4-vs-NOMAD-displays" alt="Photo of the COROS NOMAD (left) and APEX 4 (right) both sitting on a flat surface.

The hardware impressed me, especially the epic battery life, but I could tell that the GPS and HR accuracy could be better, the health tracking and software had plenty of gaps, and the MIP displays were painfully dim.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the APEX 4 is more reliably accurate (as you'll see below), the battery life still blows me away, and the MIP display has much better contrast, making it serviceable — though for whatever reason, the NOMAD's display is <em>more</em> readable indoors. I think the APEX 4's sapphire layer catches more obscuring light.</p><p>Most importantly, the APEX 4's new Ambiq Apollo 510 processor powers the speediest, smoothest maps I've seen outside of Apple and Wear OS watches, where most fitness watch rivals like Garmin are laggy. You now get street and trail names, and the crown makes it seamless to zoom in to a confusing trail turn or out to a wider view in a couple of seconds.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rp8VdRsM9wWfyQD3wd2kcM" name="COROS-APEX-4-follow-course-hiking" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation and a course line." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rp8VdRsM9wWfyQD3wd2kcM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mG9gnmoRP8C73TWzhNBNcM" name="COROS-APEX-4-off-route-warning" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation and a red "Off route" pop-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mG9gnmoRP8C73TWzhNBNcM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>My only complaints are with the turn-by-turn navigation for downloaded courses. It mostly works without issue, but I noticed twice that when I came to a loop, the arrow suggested I go in the opposite direction that I chose when I made the course.</p><p>When I intentionally went off course, the APEX 4 caught it and warned me immediately. But the turn-by-turn directions don't update based on which direction you're facing, so when I missed my right turn and turned around, it still told me to turn right. I hope COROS can address both of my map nitpicks in the future.</p><p>With its new processor, the APEX 4 is primed for years of upgrades.

While Garmin watch updates tend to dry up after 1–2 years, APEX 4 updates should last much longer.</p><p>I specifically expect its built-in depth gauge sensor to enable scuba diving at some point, and COROS told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1C3gOwMx64&t=1075s">Chase the Summit</a> that it may use the mic & speaker to enable offline voice commands in the future.</p><h2 id="coros-apex-4-gps-accuracy-2">COROS APEX 4 GPS accuracy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FoRKEYou9JEAdNGFBctTVn" name="COROS-APEX-4-satellites" alt="A COROS APEX 4 sitting on a wooden table showing all the nearby satellite signals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoRKEYou9JEAdNGFBctTVn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">All the nearby satellite signals </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not all dual-band GPS watches are created equal. Having tested nearly every smartwatch brand's GPS accuracy, I've found that COROS's most recent watches come the closest to Garmin for dependability, with the APEX 4 following that pattern. Get ready for some boringly straight GPS lines, with only a couple of glitches to speak of.</p><p>I took three dual-frequency GPS watches — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link"

The UI revolves solely around fitness: What's next on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training plan</a>, how much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>, have you built up, and how does your HRV, stress, and sleep play into your recovery?</p><p>But I'm less tolerant of certain things in 2025 than I was in 2022, like how the basic COROS UI crams dozens of tools into an annoying, rotating Toolbox, or the overly-large "COROS" label next to the display that detracts from its premium look.</p><p>Picking or skipping the APEX 4 comes down to your priorities as an athlete. Switching to the Forerunner 570, for example, would net you a flashlight, daily run suggestions, better music apps, contactless payments, and (arguably) a better display, but would lose you sapphire glass, a more stylish steel bezel, offline maps, and 5–11 days of battery life.</p><p>The APEX 4 is what grumbling Garmin users <em>say</em> that they want: A return to the MIP days, where they focused on fitness essentials and battery life over expensive bells and whistles, with a reasonable price and no frustrating feature-locking of the best features like maps.</p><p>I'll have a full review coming soon with more feature testing, but it's undoubtedly one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> of 2025...if you don't prefer AMOLED.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ce19799-453f-43af-b4b6-b9b7f0a04d19">            <a href="https://coros.com/buy/apex4" data-model-name="COROS APEX 4" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K3dJnxBPkAqqG3KJshmjMa.jpg' alt="Render of the 46mm White COROS APEX 4 fitness watch"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">COROS APEX 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The COROS APEX 4 offers a 1.3-inch AMOLED touch display with sapphire glass, 41 hours of dual-band GPS with a 24-day battery life overall, 32GB of storage for music, maps, and routes, and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calls and Voice Pin diary entries during your hikes, which are then saved to your activities to share with friends.

However, Garmin kept the Elevate sensor mostly the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. As we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, this sensor manages to be quite accurate.</p><p>I've been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-makes-major-changes-to-garmins-health-and-fitness-coaching-and-were-intrigued">Garmin Venu 4</a> for a couple of weeks as my main workout wearable. I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3">compared it to the Garmin Venu 3</a> to see how things have changed (if at all), and against the Pixel Watch 3 to see how it stacks up against my favorite smartwatch.</p><h2 id="fitness-features-i-love-2">Fitness features I love</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="4QLHohUHhQv4xGV3awrwpZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-7" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Training Readiness screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QLHohUHhQv4xGV3awrwpZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Forerunner series, the Garmin Venu 4 is more of an all-rounder, meaning there's an overall focus on fitness, not just running. Therefore, Garmin has stuffed a bunch of fitness features into the watch, building on top of previous models while making it ideal for anyone to strap one on and just go.</p><p>There are plenty of useful and new training features to help you get the most out of your workouts, but the one I pay most attention to is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-readiness/">Training Readiness</a>. This takes into account various factors, including sleep, recovery time, and acute load, to determine how hard you should push yourself in upcoming workouts. In theory, this is a good way to avoid overexerting yourself, which can negatively affect your performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3843px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="yW2W9B9uJbJHHLdScsS9MZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-4" alt="Garmin Venu 4 fitness coach" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yW2W9B9uJbJHHLdScsS9MZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3843" height="2162" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 4 also supports more coaching, which has allowed me to experience a better mix of workouts to change up my normal routine. This feels much more tailored and varied, and fans of the Venu series should find this useful. Weightlifters such as myself will also enjoy the watch's ability to count reps and sets more accurately than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, which translates to more accurate exercise and muscle categorization in post-workout stats.</p><p>You'll also receive more varied suggested workouts if you don't have a coaching plan enabled, which is a nice evolution of the Morning Report on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3897px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c4sg2Mfh6EiQJPu7si4ZuZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-3" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Training effect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4sg2Mfh6EiQJPu7si4ZuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3897" height="2192" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After each workout, the Venu 4 provides a summary of the activity, which includes metrics like training load, which gauges the intensity of your workout. You'll also see a number that indicates your recovery time, which directly affects your training readiness. This is basically your downtime between strenuous activities, including sleep. It's Garmin's way of telling you to chill.</p><h2 id="heart-rate-2">Heart rate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ts87jSr7SSJHgdejoggWTZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-2" alt="Garmin Venu 4 post-workout benefit screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ts87jSr7SSJHgdejoggWTZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3980" height="2239" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As heart rate sensors, smartwatches are fairly reliable, but ultimately, they're imperfect. How well the watch detects your heart rate can depend on a number of things, including the fit, placement, cleanliness, and even the type of band. And while Garmin's Elevate V5 heart rate monitor on the Venu 4 has proven itself over the years, it's not infallible.</p><p>In most cases, the Venu 4 appeared to be in line with expectations during my workouts. I've been working out with smartwatches long enough to know roughly what the readings should be. However, there are times when I'll notice that the watch will take a moment to actually get there, as you can see in the charts below:</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="MitTFAEZReU52yL2d2NgRf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-1" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MitTFAEZReU52yL2d2NgRf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (purple) and Pixel Watch 3 (red) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="9LBUp5WtVWzNcu9X4wLgRf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-3" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LBUp5WtVWzNcu9X4wLgRf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (purple) and Pixel Watch 3 (red) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.38%;"><img id="oviPUkP6ctawFutGrtoRUf" name="Garmin-Venu-4-vs-google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate-2" alt="Heart rate chart comparison between the Garmin Venu 4 and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oviPUkP6ctawFutGrtoRUf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="824" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Venu 4 (red) and Pixel Watch 3 (purple) heart rate chart. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As you can see in the first chart, the Venu 4 stayed well below the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> during my run. I noticed this in real-time, and couldn't determine why the readings were so off, as both watches were fit snugly on my wrists. Fortunately, the watch appeared to correct itself once my pace quickened, but it definitely threw me off during my run.</p><p>Subsequent runs did not appear to have any major discrepancies, and both watches were mostly in line with each other.

Apple does the same thing every year, as does Google. Customers want high-powered charging, and many companies aren't giving it.</p><p>But that's not what we <em>really</em> need.</p><h2 id="all-day-should-mean-something-2">"All day" should mean something</h2><p>I know I'm in the minority here, but the one thing I want from recharging a battery isn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">high speed</a> that relies on everything going right. I want to be able to plug it in and feel sure that it's going to safely do what it's supposed to do.</p><p>That doesn't mean I'm fine with having my phone tied to a cord for 90 minutes every afternoon, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="ujHAP67LKJnuYvEa5XsH3b" name="google-pixel-6-batterywidget.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 battery widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ujHAP67LKJnuYvEa5XsH3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2535" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reason we want faster charging is simple: our phones' batteries don't last nearly long enough between charges. I don't mean some tired phone with a worn-out battery, either; brand new phones don't give the advertised battery life for many folks who use them differently than the people making the promises do.</p><p>I'm not saying that companies are lying. They simply make sure everything is perfect when they determine the average battery life, and nothing is perfect once you step into reality. They are throwing out a number even though they know it is inaccurate for most people anyway, though.</p><p>If your phone lasted from morning until you went to bed, you could plug it in, let it charge nice and slowly (and safer) all night, and do it all over again the next day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know it's possible, and you probably do, too. Look at those "cheap" phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G,</a> for example. They almost always have one thing in common: a battery that's big enough. That doesn't mean gargantuan, either; the Moto G has a 5,000mAh battery that's enough to run the phone until you put it down instead of it telling you it needs to rest. Other phones do even better, but I don't think we're at "real" two-day battery life just yet.</p><h2 id="a-problem-that-can-be-fixed-2">A problem that can be fixed</h2><p>Some phone makers — I'll use OnePlus as an example here — know that something needs to be done. The solution was to engineer a way to charge the phone at unsafe power levels that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-teases-65w-warp-charge-oneplus-8t">have been made safe</a>. It works, and it is safe. Until it isn't. There are a lot of bits of tiny hardware and software needed to make it work, and when something goes wrong, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">bad things can happen</a>.

A lot of people like a thin phone, but how many are willing to charge twice a day for it? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-reportedly-cancels-plans-for-galaxy-s26-edge-heres-why-im-not-surprised">Not very many</a>, it seems.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-solid-state-battery-toyota-dyson/" target="_blank">Solid-state batteries</a> are an instant fix, and that's why you'll find them in something like a pacemaker. They have a ton of capacity without being any bigger, are safer, and provide higher output at low battery levels. They're still lithium-based, but solid electrolytes like ceramics don't explode when they get hot.</p><p>The problem is that they are expensive. The thing that makes a phone maker happiest is being able to use less money to build something and then charge you more for it. Solid-state batteries would cut into that profit margin, so don't hold your breath. A company has to make money if it wants to survive.</p><h2 id="in-a-perfect-world-2">In a perfect world</h2><p>To me, a perfect phone would be reasonable in size (nobody wants an inch-thick phone), do everything I need it to do, and not need to be charged until I'm done with it for the day. You and I probably do different things and live in different places, but I'll bet that sounds perfect to you, too.</p><p>I'm all for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">new software ideas</a> and ways to use less battery to do "stuff." Exploring ways to i<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-supervooc">ncrease power and voltage in a charging circuit</a> is really cool, too.

According to Vats, Samsung is preparing to roll out a "new album art transition effect" on your lock screen when tapping the "skip" button.</p><p>In the video, the media player's widget at the bottom looks relatively the same as it is currently in One UI 8. However, what hogs the spotlight is a rather large area reserved for the song's album cover.</p><p>Instead of detailing what song and artist are playing in the media control widget, the cover takes care of that. The album art sits prominently in the center of the lock screen, and beneath that are your core details: song title, artist, and/or featured artists. When switching songs, the album art will change accordingly, though there is a small delay between the user's interaction and the software recognizing the change.</p><p>The transition effect is quite refined, as new album covers emerge from the remains of the other. In the clip, Vats is using their Spotify songs to get this to work. It's not clear how far Samsung's support will go if this makes it to One UI 8.5's live launch. But perhaps we can expect support for YouTube Music, Pandora, and more, too.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-putting-in-the-work-2">Samsung's putting in the work</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8.5: New feature 👀Media player now adds a new album art transition effect 🎶 pic.twitter.com/OsNCzccPUN<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1979076734919283190">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Older rumors have speculated that One UI 8.5 could hold even more advancements for Samsung's software over a smaller 0.1 version patch. This seems to be the case, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-automatic-call-screen-samsung-phones">a recent report claims</a> Samsung is working on a Pixel-like calling feature for Galaxy phones. Rumors say the company is looking to develop a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screen</a> feature that uses AI to run its major processes. Such processes include call transcription, spam filtering for unknown callers/spam calls, and automatic answering.</p><p>It was suggested that users could have varying "screening levels." If at the highest, your device would act as more of a defensive bastion, blocking out most things. If lighter, then there's more leeway.</p><p>All we have are these little tidbits, as Samsung's testing things internally on its servers; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ui-8-5-beta-program-for-samsung-galaxy-late-this-fall-rumored">eager Galaxy users could get their chance</a>, too.

Android Central's Nick Sutrich says that this year's OxygenOS 16 "offers users plenty of UI customization options and focuses intensely on the beautification of the entire experience."</p><p>The new OS is said to be so "smooth" and gives users many ways to customize their lock screen and app drawer with animations.

Zack Nelson, the host of the 'JerryRigEverything' channel on YouTube, put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> through his infamous durability test. And things got pretty ugly, with Google's latest Fold pretty much exploding and smoking during the bend test.</p><p>Here's what happened: the first time he bent the device in reverse, it pretty much snapped in half at the antenna lines on top. However, when he tried to bend the device further, the battery almost instantly gave out and began smoking.</p><p>According to Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand, this was caused by something called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">thermal runaway</a>. It occurs when something causes a spot in the battery to heat up, such as the excessive pressure from the bend test. Which created "a self-sustaining chain reaction that heats adjacent spots until everything becomes hot enough to burn."</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-may-be-gone-for-good-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge may be gone for good</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-4" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1938" height="1084" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>The word on the street is that Samsung has reportedly cancelled its Edge variant, as its predecessor didn't fare well in the market.

While we don't know for sure what caused it, we assume that its hefty price tag and the battery capacity could've pushed for this to happen.</p><p>This has led Samsung to reportedly cut production and offer heavy discounts on the device. Which means we won't be seeing it in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup, as a Samsung executive said that the slim Edge line is unlikely to return. This means that there may not be a line-up reshuffle after all, and that Samsung could be sticking to its usual base, Plus, and Ultra trio.</p><h2 id="android-16-qpr2-beta-3-landed-but-was-pulled-back-2">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 landed, but was pulled back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="Xdy5WEPLCQHCE6SGDUNaAX" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xdy5WEPLCQHCE6SGDUNaAX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2408" height="1032" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Android 16's next beta just about landed before it was pulled from the servers due to a boot loop issue.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> are first on the list to receive the OxygenOS 16 update in November, which includes the 13R, 13s, and the 12R. However, the company states that its OnePlus Open, Pad 3, and Pad 2 are on deck for next month, too.</p><p>December is when the software starts rolling out for several past-gen models. Owners of a OnePlus 11 5G, 11R 5G, Nord 5, Nord CE5, Nord 4, and Nord 3 5G should receive the patch sometime in December.</p><p>Even more devices are slated for OxygenOS 16, but OnePlus is a little more vague. The following models aren't set to receive the update until Q1 2026, which can be anywhere from January to March, so be aware.</p><ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro 5G</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE4</li><li>OnePlus Nord NE 4 Lite 5G</li><li>OnePlus Pad</li><li>OnePlus Pad Lite</li></ul><h2 id="new-os-time-s-are-crazy-2">New OS time's are crazy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yPYHWk4evMnodZmmxtkYvF" name="oneplus-oxygenos-16-official-infographic" alt="The official infographic from OnePlus showing the main updates in OxygenOS 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPYHWk4evMnodZmmxtkYvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus has delivered a warning, informing users that not everyone will see its update simultaneously. It states that OxygenOS 16 is rolling out in "batches," meaning some users in some countries could see it in the first week of November, while others may see it in the third week (just as an example). Keep your eyes peeled for more updates, and, the more likely scenario, an alert on your OnePlus phone/tablet.</p><p>OxygenOS 16 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">launched just yesterday</a>, and users were treated to software that truly knows them. Quickly getting the Apple iOS references out, OxygenOS 16 offers a revamped AI experience that is focused on personalizing your device through "intelligent data interactions." Users will find tools like AI Writer and AI Scan to help make mundane tasks a little easier.</p><p>There's also Plus Mind, which is an AI-centric place on your device for housing your screenshots about locations, dates, and more. The AI will offer suggestions for you based on those screenshots to help you make plans, trips, or even dinner.</p><p>Speaking of Plus Mind, OnePlus' Mind Space got a huge update during OxygenOS 16, one that brings Gemini into the mix. Users can connect Mind Space to Gemini and let the AI dig through their stored screenshots to help them with any queries they may have. It works like Gemini's Extensions for YouTube, Spotify, and more Workspace apps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As a result, users in Korea can no longer download or reinstall the software.</p><p>What makes this even more interesting is that this isn’t an isolated incident. A few days ago, Samsung also halted the same One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S22 lineup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s22-android-16-update">a week after its rollout</a>. That earlier rollback hinted that something was off with Samsung’s latest software build, and now, with the S24 series facing the same pause, it’s clear the issue might run deeper than expected.</p><p>According to reports on X, Samsung also pulled the firmware for the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Attention Galaxy S24 users ❗️Samsung has pulled One UI 8 build from the OTA server Korea 🇰🇷 👀S24 series:CYI9 (OneUI8) ➡️ BYG8 (OneUI7) S24Fe:CYI9 (OneUI8) ➡️ BYG2 (OneUI7)#Samsung #OneUI8 #GalaxyS24 #GalaxyS24fe pic.twitter.com/H2csnVBbA9<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1979111658271240450">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="no-major-user-complaints-for-now-2">No major user complaints (for now)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is surprising that users who have already installed the update have not reported major bugs or widespread issues. That makes this sudden halt even more surprising, as it seems Samsung’s decision was preemptive rather than reactive. The company might be dealing with a subtle underlying glitch or a problem that only appears under certain regional configurations or carrier settings.</p><p>Interestingly, the suspension appears to affect only the Korean market for now. The One UI 8 update remains available in other regions, at least as of this writing, and it's unclear whether the rollback could expand to other regions.</p><p>Still, the delay might hint that Samsung is rechecking its regional firmware builds before pushing them further. It’s also worth noting that the One UI 8 rollout for the Galaxy S22 series in Korea still hasn’t resumed.</p><p>For now, S24 owners in Korea who already installed One UI 8 can continue using it without problems, but those who haven’t yet updated are stuck waiting for Samsung’s next move.</p><p>The company hasn’t made any public statement about the reason behind the halt, but given its recent pattern, it’s likely working on a fixed or patched version of the firmware.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plus, it's well-liked for its battery life, Google Gemini AI features, and a great set of cameras that are perfect for parents, photography and videography enthusiasts, or just casual users who want crisp, clear images and videos.</p><p>If you like a smaller form factor and you were already considering going with a Pixel phone, this might be a good opportunity to consider picking the 10 Pro up.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-render-Moonstone-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$999.99</del> <strong>free with select plan and new line</strong></a></p><p>One of Verizon's latest free phone deals is for the powerful Google Pixel 10 Pro, a relatively compact performance monster that usually retails for $1,000.

It also comes with powerful cameras, including an ultrawide lens with macro focus, the highly useful 15W Pixelsnap Qi2 charging integration, and seven years of OS updates.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro is backed by the Google Tensor G5 processor, which is largely responsible for the device's smooth performance. It also sports 16GB of RAM and 30W wired charging. This particular deal is for the base-level 128GB version of the 10 Pro, though most casual users (or those with cloud storage) can make that work.</p><p>All in all, if you're already a Verizon customer or were thinking about switching, this is a great way to score a free Google Pixel phone, though you'll want to act while supplies last.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not all users will see the update immediately, and full migration from Google Assistant to Gemini is still in flux. What’s certain is that Google sees Nest as a frontline showcase, so it is testing visual cues now and planning to layer in functional AI enhancements later.</p><p>Right now, the colorful new lights are a fun surprise that make Nest speakers feel fresh again. It’s a small update, but it points to bigger changes coming to Google’s smart home products. As Gemini becomes a bigger part of our routines, we’ll likely see more updates like this that change how we use our smart devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Dallas, Texas-based company usually puts out unassuming phones at rock bottom prices, specializing in a market that's rather underserved here in the United States. But this time around, Nuu is shaking things up and delivering something truly... new (get it?)... for this price segment.</p><p>The Nuu B40 5G is a $299 phone with dual AMOLED displays. The 120Hz 6.7-inch display up front does what you expect and looks good doing it, but it's the 1.6-inch "Vista Display" on the back that holds the real parlor trick of this phone.</p><p>It sports a passing resemblance to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch" target="_blank">Xiaomi 17</a>, but at a significantly lower price and with an official Amazon listing coming later in November. For now, you can sign up for the early access promotion at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nuumobile.com/">Nuumobile.com</a> and get $100 off in celebration of the launch until November 3. Yeah, that means this thing is just $199 if you buy it now. Here's what to expect.</p><h2 id="nuu-horizons-2">Nuu horizons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pN45Zmem5CfeMaUon7btqe" name="nuu-b40-5g-back-display-clock-03" alt="The back of the NUU B40 5G with its dual camera module and accompanying 1.6-inch AMOLED display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pN45Zmem5CfeMaUon7btqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nuu B40 5G's design looks like most phones that came out of the Galaxy S8 era. It's got curved glass on the front and a curved plastic back that tucks into the plastic frame. The company did a good job making the back feel more like glass than anything, and the sides feel like a sort of matte aluminum that appears more premium than it might actually be.</p><p>The star of the show is the new 1.6-inch display placed inside the camera island around the back, flanking the dual 64MP camera sensors. You can activate the display by double-tapping it and swiping through the available cards to perform actions.</p><p>In total, there's a "homescreen" of sorts that includes 10 different designs, all of which feature a digital or analog clock. Some designs also include a pedometer, the day and date, or a battery percentage indicator.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LW5y7kdNFiNhoB5QtB7jhk" name="nuu-b40-5g-back-display-clock-options" alt="The clock options for the rear display on the NUU B40 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LW5y7kdNFiNhoB5QtB7jhk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notifications come straight through here and provide smartwatch-like glanceable information that you can easily see if you like to keep your phone face down on a table. Swiping through the stack of cards shows a compass, music player, and camera. There don't appear to be any additional options here, which is a little disappointing, but Nuu may add more in a future update.</p><p>The camera feature allows you to easily use the main rear camera as a selfie camera, giving you access to better camera hardware than the front-facing one. By the way, that secondary rear camera is a pretty useless 2MP macro camera. Nuu doesn't give a way to switch to it using the smaller Vista Display, which is fine by me. Meanwhile, the primary camera is easy to see even on the tiny display, making it a good way to capture group photos with slightly improved quality.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7iMwsiGZR8vWsKBoVTfZE9" name="nuu-b40-5g-back-display-notifications" alt="Viewing a new notification on the 1.6-inch rear AMOLED display on the NUU B40 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7iMwsiGZR8vWsKBoVTfZE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EjsTSuVHoTttyUahZnHXD9" name="nuu-b40-5g-back-display-compass" alt="The compass tile on the 1.6-inch rear AMOLED display on the NUU B40 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EjsTSuVHoTttyUahZnHXD9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F6XKK7ST4QbXrin4Vm97QE" name="nuu-b40-5g-back-display-camera-01" alt="The NUU B40 5G's rear camera island with inlaid display panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6XKK7ST4QbXrin4Vm97QE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aGf7podq4L4aLpWyjZBvD9" name="nuu-b40-5g-side-buttons-camera-island" alt="The right side and camera island on the NUU B40 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aGf7podq4L4aLpWyjZBvD9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="usfhbPW6VZEL4aRPwFHtD9" name="nuu-b40-5g-bottom" alt="The bottom of the NUU B40 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usfhbPW6VZEL4aRPwFHtD9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As for Nuu's software, it's about as unassuming as you could get, featuring a very AOSP-like build of Android 15 with a select few features added on top.

The phone is just 5.8mm thin, which is downright impressive from a technological standpoint, but it is overshadowed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review" target="_blank">iPhone Air</a> with its 5.64mm frame.</p><p>To avoid burying the lede, super-thin phones aren't for me, and it's not because I have an almost two-year-old running around the house.

Just over a month after its launch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-arent-meeting-expectations-report-claims">reports surfaced</a> that "Galaxy S25 Edge sales aren't meeting expectations."

Let's see why that might be.</p><h2 id="compromises-aplenty-2">Compromises aplenty</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eZLMw3rB5KAXybRqyXu6oc" name="Fireworks-Android-Phone" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge overlaid on a firework show." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZLMw3rB5KAXybRqyXu6oc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most immediately apparent compromise is that the S25 Edge retails for $999 and only features a dual camera setup. Yes, it's using the same 200MP main wide-angle lens as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. But it also sports a downgraded 12MP ultrawide lens and drops the telephoto sensor altogether.</p><p>But what if you don't really care about not having the telephoto lens? Well, the decision to make a phone as thin as possible has another glaring consequence: a smaller battery. The S25 Edge sports a 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X 120Hz display, which is the same as the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a lot of pixels to power, not to mention that the power-hungry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> is behind the steering wheel. So while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> is equipped with a 4,900mAh battery, the S25 Edge comes in with a paltry 3,900mAh cell. According to Samsung, you'll be able to get about 30 hours of playback with the Plus, with the Edge only capable of lasting for up to 24 hours.</p><p>No thank you. Battery anxiety is not something that I particularly enjoy.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-iphone-air-2">What about the iPhone Air?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just because I compared the S25 Edge to the S25 Plus doesn't mean I'm giving Apple a pass here with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a>. Again, it's a feat of modern engineering, arguably even more than the S25 Edge, as Apple managed to squeeze the entire logic board and cameras into the "plateau" on the back, while also being thinner.</p><p>That said, the iPhone Air is also full of compromises once you get past the "oohs" and "aahs." Notably, Apple used a modified version of its A19 Pro chip that uses "one fewer GPU core" than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> series. Plus, Apple intentionally introduced performance limits in the form of thermal throttling due to the size of the chassis. As a result, the iPhone Air actually falls short of the S25 Edge in GPU-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review#section-apple-iphone-air-performance-and-battery">benchmarks</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4" name="iPhone-Air-8" alt="A close-up of the camera plateau of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And as for the camera, the iPhone Air is ostensibly worse than the Edge, only featuring a single 48MP lens. Apple tries to obfuscate this by calling it a "Fusion" lens and banking on the 2x "optical-quality" images, but as Brady Snyder pointed out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review#section-apple-iphone-air-camera" target="_blank">his iPhone Air review</a>, "Two things can be true: it's not a gimmick, but it's also not a replacement for a telephoto camera."</p><p>However, for all of its technological wonder, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/02/iphone-17-strong-demand-morgan-stanley/" target="_blank">reports claim</a> demand for the iPhone Air just isn't there.</p><p>In the case of the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung can just chalk it up to a failed experiment for whatever reason it wants to give. With the iPhone Air, I believe Apple released this phone as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test" target="_blank">a test</a> to gauge feedback, durability, and production, as the company prepares to release its first foldable device. Basically, it was a way for Apple to make back some of the R&D money it's already spent, so don't be surprised if this is a "one and done" release for Apple, too.</p><h2 id="waste-of-time-money-and-resources-2">Waste of time, money, and resources</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's not something Samsung has to really worry about, as the company already released its "testing grounds" device with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Z Fold Special Edition</a> late last year. It was only released in South Korea, but it allowed Samsung to get some feedback before rolling out a very similar (if not identical) design to what we now have with the excellent Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>At the end of the day, this is why the Galaxy S25 Edge didn't make much sense to begin with. Samsung already offers a strong balance of devices with the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra, and there really wasn't anything that differentiated the Edge. Well, besides offering a fourth phone that didn't last as long and wasn't as versatile, it also cost $100 more than the S25 Plus. It had too many compromises.</p><p>Maybe it was just a way for Samsung to try to cut into some of Apple's market share before the iPhone Air was released. Or maybe there were other plans in store that had to be ditched for one reason or another. But as we're starting to see, the masses don't really care about ultra-thin slab phones anymore, especially if they're making too many sacrifices.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c0ff7ead-c155-4f70-920a-41130f9bd6f5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKTvKqpiSi4SNKmBvZ7CGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><strong>It's neat, if it's on sale</strong></p><p>Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S25 Edge is a cool phone, but you should really only consider picking one up if it's on sale or if you have an old phone to offset the cost.

Now the rumor on the street is that there may not be a line-up reshuffle after all, and that Samsung could be sticking to its usual Base, Plus, and Ultra trio.</p><p>Where's the Pro, you ask? According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-naming/">Sam Mobile</a>, sources close to the publication told them that the "Pro" moniker, which was supposedly replacing the base model,  isn't actually making its way to Samsung smartphones.

So we might get the same Galaxy S26 (without a Pro attachment), a Galaxy S26 Plus, and a Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>Which sort of makes sense, because if the base model got the Pro moniker, then Samsung would have to truly bring Pro-level features to the phone. Like giving the base model larger, better displays, more advanced cameras (e.g., more lenses or higher zoom), more storage/memory, and sometimes extra productivity tools or accessories, which doesn't seem like it's going to happen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base model is definitely going to see some upgrades when it comes to software and the chipset, as it is rumored to get either the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5"> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 </a>chip or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600 processor,</a> based on the region it launches in.

There were two instances of the image generator's potential arrival in the app, but the most forward-facing piece is within personal chats. According to the tipster, Google is seemingly developing/testing a Nano Banana icon in the top navigational bar in chats.</p><p>However, the only way users will see it is when long-pressing an image in that chat. The banana icon was reported right beside the trash icon in a personal thread.</p><p>The unfortunate side is that this icon isn't working; nothing is truly working as of yet. Aside from long-pressing an image, the tipster reports that Google hasn't yet enabled functionality of the Nano Banana button, meaning any practical demos were dashed.

Earlier this week, Nano Banana started arriving in NotebookLM, offering the ability for users to generate photos to pair with their study/research material. The AI can create images in a few different styles, such as Watercolor, Anime, and Retro Print.</p><p>Google Search is going bananas, too, as Google Lens starts receiving "Create." Through this new button, users can snap a photo with their camera and immediately change it with a prompt for Nano Banana. This same AI is also headed for Google Photos, as a way for users to quickly edit photos in their libraries.</p><p>Looking back, it makes sense that Google is so adamant about adding Nano Banana to more apps, since it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">reportedly drew in 10 million new users</a> to the Gemini app. The announcement was made early in September, just a few weeks after the AI image generator launched. In that short timespan, Nano Banana had reportedly created over 200 million images, with the prompt to turn someone into a figurine taking the cake as the most popular.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1892653244/Q9fNlrY02?pagetype=profilefeed">livestream overnight</a>, Lu Weibing revealed that the Xiaomi 17 series "broke the first-sale record" for phones in the Chinese market for 2025 (machine-translated). The series was so popular that records were broken merely five minutes after the devices went live for purchase.</p><p>The standout here is the 17 Pro Max, which Lu Weibing reportedly said broke "first-day sales" records and sales records for "domestic phones."</p><p>While the 17 series boasts a few improvements over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">the 15 series</a>, the true showstopper was the "Dynamic Back Display" on the 17 Pro and Pro Max. This is a 2.1-inch display on the back of the phone that wraps around its dual camera array, delivering a unique set of interactions that (in some ways) mirror a foldable experience. According to Lu Weibing's statement during the livestream, it's the rear display that's caused such an influx of consumers migrating toward the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">Xiaomi 17 Pro and Pro Max</a>.</p><p>As a result, the publication cites Lu Weibing in saying that Xiaomi will reportedly "continue to use" this Dynamic Back Display on future flagship phones.

This device launched in 2021, and it had a rear display alongside its camera housing system. However, the display was vertical and small, only offering a glimpse of the time and date—the necessities, one might say.</p><p>It kind of feels like Xiaomi was ahead of its time with that device, as the tech that it has available now wasn't like that back then. Now, with it surging ahead with foldables, it can bring those lessons learned and intelligence to the newer 17 series, a slab phone with a foldable touch.</p><p>The Chinese publication mentions that Xiaomi is already preparing even more updates for the Dynamic Back Display, as well.</p><p>We'll have to wait for now to see what Xiaomi ends up cooking for next year's launch.

For that reason, it landed a spot as our favorite premium foldable phone upon its release, and in no small part due to its huge, good-looking 8-inch AMOLED display. Compared to older models of the Z Fold, which kind of felt like a heavy remote control when folded, the Z Fold 7 includes an even larger and wider cover screen, a more subtle crease, and just an overall sleeker build that we love.</p><p>This particular deal is for the upgraded 512GB version of the phone, though there's also a slightly more affordable 256GB version if you don't need that much storage.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7J243YH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.93%;"><img id="RDNwNL995uXSRoo2iwFPsc" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RDNwNL995uXSRoo2iwFPsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1499" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (512GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7J243YH" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$2,119.99</del> <strong>$1,719.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has dropped to its lowest price ever at Amazon, marking a 19% discount and bringing it to $1,720.

It also comes with 12GB of RAM, ultrawide, telephoto, and wide-angle camera lenses, and a range of powerful Galaxy AI features.</p><p>It's probably not the best battery life out there, especially because of the massive, power-intensive screen, but we've been able to make it last for more than a day when not using the screen super often. Beyond that, it also has 25W wired charging and 15W wireless, and while there are faster charging phones out there, this will get the job done for most casual users.</p><p>Perhaps the phone's biggest downsides are simply its price tag—which is slightly better with this deal—and its lack of support for the Samsung S Pen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Everyone is suited up to jump out, and just as the bay doors open, a brown backpack is thrown out that looks <em>a lot</em> like a parachute. Unfortunately, you don't have time to wonder if the thing on your back is a real parachute or a fake, because the plane has already ejected everyone, and you're now free-falling at 10,000ft in the air.</p><p>Knowing what's likely going to happen, it's pretty clear to you that <em>you're</em> not going to be the one landing without a parachute. For the next several minutes, all eight of you battle it out in the clouds, using your arm-mounted rockets and grappling hooks to catch other players and keep the backpack until the end.</p><p>The game is Project Freefall, and its unique nature isn't just the gameplay; it's also the fact that you can play on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">a Meta Quest headset</a>, a Steam Deck, or any of the other non-VR platforms the game supports, all flying together in a fairly rare cross-platform quest to reach the bottom.</p><h2 id="battle-royale-against-the-clock-2">Battle royale against the clock</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pj4BEJ7JLx8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Developer Schell Games has long made some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. The veteran VR studio is behind well-known games like I Expect You to Die, Among Us VR, Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire, Until You Fall, and many more. While Among Us VR eventually became <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-3d-proves-non-vr-crossplay-should-be-future-of-quest-games">Among Us 3D</a> with crossplay support between VR and non-VR systems, Project Freefall is designed for crossplay from day one.</p><p>The game launched in "earliest access" this week during Steam Next Fest, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/project-freefall/7932952873476077">a demo on the Meta Quest</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592440/Project_Freefall/">a demo on Steam</a> that you can download right now. Since the game is multiplayer only, I recommend visiting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/invite/schellgames">Schell Games' Discord server</a> and joining any one of the active sessions posted there.</p><p>Project Freefall is simple enough in concept, but certainly one of those games that'll become increasingly complex as players master the unique movement systems. As you're falling through the air, you not only have those arm-mounted thrusters, but each hand has an independent grappling hook that can be used to grab items or pull yourself toward obstacles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="Lda2yT9irLmT3rWuYYQNRb" name="freefall-steam-deck" alt="Playing Project Freefall on a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lda2yT9irLmT3rWuYYQNRb.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="384" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why are there giant Ninja Warrior-esque obstacles falling through the air while you skydive? It's a video game that's not afraid to be a video game, that's why! Any number of objects can fall, from giant shark statues to literal Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses that you can pull yourself through to avoid being tagged.</p><p>Grabbing the backpack is as easy as simply running into the player wearing it, from whence you'll immediately boost away wearing the coveted prize. Schell Games told me this small boost was introduced in early testing to help avoid the pitfalls of backpack juggling, giving players a brief moment to collect themselves before being chased.</p><p>Along with those giant obstacles that help make movement more complex in an otherwise empty sky, you'll find a smattering of power-ups and items that help you achieve the goal of holding the backpack the longest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="2ZRrnkRm3xnBVgFb3CqkGg" name="freefall-vr" alt="Playing Project Freefall on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ZRrnkRm3xnBVgFb3CqkGg.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether it's a paint grenade to blind your opponents, Mario Kart style, or a bat that you can smack them with and stun them, these items are all about increasing the competitive nature of the game.</p><p>And that brings me to the unique qualities of playing on each supported platform. VR players will find that they have a distinct movement advantage, as they can easily aim each of their arms in different directions or even blind fire toward an obstacle while faking movement toward another. It's a classic juke movement that's made even more chaotic by the freedom of movement VR allows.</p><p>But non-VRs aren't at a disadvantage, despite being a little stiffer. While the VR version plays out in first person, the non-VR version is entirely done in 3rd-person. This gives the non-VR version a distinct perspective advantage, as you can more easily see everything around you without having to whip your head around constantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s7Bvg3e8iwobDH3pT8LTy6" name="project-freefall-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of players falling through the air in Project Freefall for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s7Bvg3e8iwobDH3pT8LTy6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Schell Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Schell Games told me it worked around the clock to balance these two distinct gaming perspectives, ensuring that neither platform has an overwhelming advantage. Some players will simply choose one over the other based on either convenience or their own strengths. If anything, playing it on a Steam Deck made it feel more chill, while the VR version felt far more active and chaotic, effectively highlighting the strengths of both systems.</p><p>The full early access period begins on October 21 and is fully free to play. A fairly standard skin shop is set up for players to purchase unique skins if they want, although in-game currency ensures that you will be able to earn skins and plenty of other fun cosmetic prizes without having to bankroll your character.</p><p>Check out the demo now and give it a shot!

At first glance, the Pixel 10 Pro is a bit unassuming, as it essentially looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, just with some new colors. But that couldn't be further from the truth once you start using the phone, as there are at least twelve new AI-powered features on board.</p><p>As one would expect, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> powers all of these new features in some way, whether that be via the cloud or actually on the device. Some of these features are Magic Cue, Daily Hub, and Edit with Ask Photos, but as noted in our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> is really the standout here.</p><p>That's because it's essentially an assistant you don't have to invoke to get help. Instead, you'll notice new icons or buttons appearing when someone texts you about dinner plans, or if you get an email confirming an upcoming flight. It's early days, but Magic Cue feels like we're getting closer to the true meaning of a "digital assistant."</p><p>But, as previously mentioned, this is just one of the many Gemini-powered features that are currently exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. And what better way to get a taste of the future than with the latest and greatest phone that Google has to offer?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-upgrade-pick"><span>Best upgrade pick</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">2.

And in recent years, that has extended to an ever-growing number of AI features found in every nook and cranny. No, it's not mainly Bixby doing the work here, but instead, it's a combination of Samsung's own AI efforts paired with Google Gemini.</p><p>One of the coolest features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the ability to perform multiple actions with a single command. You can watch a YouTube video about basically anything, activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, ask it to summarize the video, and have the results saved in Samsung Notes. The same is true when creating calendar events or adding details to an existing one. While it might seem trivial, these features can really come in handy.</p><p>There are also features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, which I previously dubbed "Google Now reincarnated." Now Brief provides summaries throughout your day, highlighting calendar events, the weather, and even news headlines from topics you're interested in. These "Briefs" are delivered periodically, and thanks to the power of the onboard AI, are great for providing reminders or giving you an idea of what the next day will bring.</p><p>Of course, there are even more AI-powered features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which removes background and unnecessary noise from a video with just the tap of a button. Not only that, but you can adjust the "EQ" levels, allowing you to make sure that whoever is talking is crystal clear.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There's even "Read Aloud" in the Samsung Internet app, which takes the text from an article and converts it to audio so you can listen instead of reading.</p><p>However, the Galaxy A56 is also chock-full of AI-enhanced photography and videography tools. Things like Object Eraser and Edit Suggestion help you get rid of those people in the background while adding a bit of bokeh effect to an image in no time. Then, there's Auto Trim that analyzes videos you've recorded and chops them up into smaller "highlight videos" to share.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable"><span>Best foldable</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-21" alt="Moto AI contextual option on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">4.

Some of these, such as Circle to Search and Magic Editor, are already staples across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>But Motorola took things a step further with Image Studio for image generation and Playlist Studio for delivering generated music playlists. Not to mention that the Razr Ultra features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">dedicated AI Key</a> that invokes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> without needing to do anything but long-press a button.</p><p>The AI Key isn't the only unique AI feature of the Razr Ultra, as this is also the first time we've seen Perplexity partner with a smartphone company. As a result of the partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">announced in April 2025</a>, Perplexity is pre-installed, and you'll get three months of Perplexity Pro for free. This comes with a few different benefits, such as Deep Research and access to a variety of AI models.</p><p>While that might not seem like a big deal, considering that most phones "only" include access to Gemini or a company's own AI features, it gives the Razr Ultra an edge over the rest. And while the implementation might not be as robust as Gemini, Perplexity has been integrated into Moto AI and offers much more than just operating as a replacement for Google.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-iphone"><span>Best iPhone</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-apple-iphone-17-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">5.

The iPhone is all you get when you're in the Apple ecosystem, but that also means that you might think you're just stuck with Siri for your "AI digital assistant." Despite the fact that Siri is still living in the Stone Age, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence</a> on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max offers a better experience than you might think.</p><p>Much of this is made possible through various partnerships that Apple has made in an effort to fill the massive gap between Siri and Gemini or Amazon Alexa. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT is deeply integrated into iOS, allowing you to get more accurate results compared to relying solely on Siri.</p><p>Visual Intelligence is essentially Google's Circle to Search, just wrapped in Apple's divisive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass UI</a>.

Don't fret, as the OnePlus 13 is here and even garnered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">perfect 5-star rating</a> from AC's own Nick Sutrich. It doesn't just offer a great overall experience, but OnePlus AI provides access to an abundance of AI features that you might not have known you needed.</p><p>The biggest example of this is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus Mind Space</a>, which consolidates important pictures, videos, events, and more into one app. Then, anything you add to Mind Space will appear whenever using the built-in AI search functionality, with the OnePlus 13 analyzing the query and providing relevant results and answers.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch" target="_blank">AI PlayLab</a> was introduced, with OnePlus hoping to get feedback from its customers about potential upcoming AI features that are currently in development. The first two features included were YumSee and Party Up, with the former providing an AI translation of restaurant menus, and the latter being able to edit a picture and turn it into "live party-themed videos."</p><p>All the while, the OnePlus 13 still offers one of the best smartphone experiences to date. Which we expect will continue once its successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, is finally introduced and released.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><h2 id="what-s-the-best-ai-phone-2">What's the best AI phone?</h2><p>Deciding between these options when choosing the best AI phone wasn't as easy as you might think. However, the easiest decision was to place the Pixel 10 Pro at the top, as it offers the most complete Gemini AI experience available. And when you consider that basically every other phone on this list integrates Gemini in some way, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro a no-brainer. Really, the only argument is whether the larger screen of the Pixel 10 Pro XL is better.</p><p>Beyond that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is another obvious inclusion, as Samsung continues to implement its own spin on AI features. As such, it delivers a more robust package across the board when compared to the Pixel 10 Pro or even the OnePlus 13. Plus, the S25 Ultra spent most of 2025 as the best overall phone for many, and we suspect that its successor will quickly take over the reins.</p><p>However, it's important to point out that not all of the best AI features are natively built into these phones. There are countless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI apps</a> on the Play Store that can be quickly downloaded and make a lasting impact, all without needing to spend hundreds of dollars (or more). Sure, they're not going to be implemented at a system level, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored, either.</p><ul><li><strong>More phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>When OnePlus started teasing its Android 16 update, I got a little bit nervous. Everything we'd seen officially from the company looked like it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygen-os-16-looks-a-lot-like-ios-teasers-confirm-its-launch">just ripping off iOS</a>, and I don't know about you, but that's <em>not</em> why I use a OnePlus phone.</p><p>Thankfully, what we'd been seeing are just new <em>options</em> that users can enable if they want. Like the split notification shade OnePlus introduced last year, this year's OxygenOS 16 offers users plenty of UI customization options and focuses intensely on the beautification of the entire experience.</p><p>That ranges from new lockscreen options, new animations, smoother performance, an updated theme engine, AI-powered photography options that are designed to make the camera even better than before, and plenty more! I've spent several days with OxygenOS 16 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and came away super impressed with what's in store for users as it starts rolling out globally today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-themes-and-lockscreen"><span>Themes and lockscreen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xTpYmem4pAJRxPYNWEMhYk" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-lockscreen-chickens" alt="A custom lockscreen with chickens created on a OnePlus 13 using OxygenOS 16's new options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTpYmem4pAJRxPYNWEMhYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing you're sure to notice is how much of a glow-up the theme engine and, by proxy, the lockscreen have received. When I first booted up the OxygenOS 16 update, I was greeted by a majestic mountain wallpaper complete with gorgeous new moving wallpaper effects and incredible depth.</p><p>OnePlus answered the call for users to customize the text on the lockscreen, so no more settling for just "Never Settle" or some other random word like "fast," as you had to in OxygenOS 15. Not only that, but you can select any <em>motion photo</em> taken with the camera and apply it to the lockscreen, complete with depth effects and movement. It's <strong>gorgeous</strong> and creates a whole new style you're going to spend hours tweaking.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-notification-shade-and-homescreen"><span>Notification shade and homescreen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sqJueFzERhyzvJV5JrarBW" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-notifications" alt="The new notification shade design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqJueFzERhyzvJV5JrarBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lockscreen isn't the only thing getting a glow-up! Both the homescreen and notification shade have received some excellent tweaks. App icons are now prominently displayed on the left side of each notification, including an easy-to-see number for nofication groups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8RpwSWPCBgCX5ZgNAvbaBd" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-homescreen-widgets-02" alt="The new widget corner design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8RpwSWPCBgCX5ZgNAvbaBd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Homescreen icons can now be stretched to fit larger spaces. If you have just one icon and want to fill a gap, it'll turn into a lovely little colored button. Likewise, widgets now have a more rounded shape, giving them a more uniform appearance, but you can disable it if you don't like the new style.</p><p>The app drawer got a nice redesign too, adding a new categorical view you can swipe between that auto-categorizes apps into folders. I still prefer the alphabetized drawer, and the redesigned alphabetical scrolling wheel on the right now singles out each letter's apps instead of just scrolling through the drawer, helping to better isolate apps that start with each letter.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-animations"><span>Animations</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2zLBoMhYKTunQtxc2X5hR" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-lockscreen-animation" alt="The new lockscreen animations and customization options in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2zLBoMhYKTunQtxc2X5hR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus made a big deal of animations in OxygenOS 15, and the company is doubling down with Parallel Processing 2.0, which allows new animations to begin before other ones have even finished. That ensures that fun animations complement each other instead of canceling out.</p><p>One of my favorite new animations is seeing apps slide outward when using the back gesture. You can play around with this by heading to system navigation in system settings, then enabling <strong>swipe animations</strong>. It's very fun and helps complete the feeling of a cohesive, fluid OS!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-portraits"><span>Better portraits</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s5qydXLjnWFWnUc2bknakZ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-perfect-shot" alt="Using OxygenOS 16's Perfect Shot feature to select another expression for a boy in a photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5qydXLjnWFWnUc2bknakZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've found that the OnePlus 13 often takes excellent portrait photos, but there are a few times when I hope for better results. OxygenOS 16 adds a ton of new portrait enhancement features, including much-needed post-processing options that let you adjust the amount of blur and lighting on foreground objects and people.</p><p>You can edit any photo taken previously, so these new features work on both new and existing photos. Speaking of older photos, people who have a vast catalog of photos on their OnePlus phones will find the new Perfect Shot feature to be a godsend. Tapping Perfect Shot will scan your gallery (assuming you gave it permission) for similar faces, then offer alternative expressions based on that person's other pictures.</p><p>It's similar to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a> feature, but it doesn't just work on photos taken in a single group burst. This is the <em>perfect</em> solution for those of us with teenagers or pre-teens who never seem to want to smile, as you can pretty easily swap out that angsty stare with a nice smile if you've got a few sitting in your gallery. It feels like magic!</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-mind-space"><span>Mind Space</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-plus-mind-summary" alt="Looking through a summary of gym notes stored in Plus Mind in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus may have launched Mind Space with the middling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13S</a> a few months ago, but this is the first time I'm getting to use it on my standard OnePlus 13. While I'm hoping OnePlus adds a few more ways to quickly get to Mind Space on phones without a dedicated side key, it's easy enough to three-finger swipe down to capture anything and send it to Mind Space on this phone.</p><p>Accessing it via a quick icon on the homescreen is also fine enough, but it's what's inside that I'm really loving. Ever since Nothing launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> with the Nothing Phone 3a series back in the Spring, other Android OEMs have been adding a similar feature that works even better than Nothing's design.

That means you don't even have to open the app to start a search.

Speaking about intuitiveness, Lam says that the OS will "truly understand and adapt to each user."</p><p>This is where "Plus Mind" comes into play; it will see what's on your screen and your interactions with the device, and sends this data to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space,</a> which is a hub for all this captured data. For instance, if you take a picture of an event poster, it'll grab the date and time and ask if you want to add it to your calendar.</p><p>With the Plus Mind comes a shortcut called the "Plus Key," which is a three-finger swipe-up and can be customized based on the user's needs. The Plus Key can be assigned to basic actions like screenshots, flashlight, camera, and switching between different ring modes.</p><h2 id="all-about-the-ui-2">All about the UI </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qCjRHfBL8DvbiuCahujEpU" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-flux-themes-mountain" alt="Customizing the lockscreen in Flux Themes 2.0 in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qCjRHfBL8DvbiuCahujEpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS 16 brings a revamped interface for users to make it more of their own. The new OS is said to be so "smooth" and offers many ways to customize your lock screen and app drawer with animations. It brings something called the "Flux Theme 2.0," which also leans in to let you personalize your wallpaper with moving photos and videos, including cool 3D effects that react to you.</p><p>The new Fluid Cloud is a smart, interactive hub that works with other apps. It gives you real-time alerts and updates from apps like Spotify, food delivery services, and sports, keeping you easily connected.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qz4aWKcxyV84ouQhjaXsoU" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-flux-themes" alt="Flux Themes 2.0 in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qz4aWKcxyV84ouQhjaXsoU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The icons see soft blur effects, rounded corners, and see-through elements in Quick Settings, Home Screen, and App Drawer. Even basic apps like the clock and calculator get improved visual feedback, making them look and work better.</p><p>The OS update isn't limited to just phones; even the OnePlus tablets are in for a smooth and fast experience. They get a revamped home screen with "scalable icons and an expanded dock that supports up to 18 apps, optimizing screen space for quicker access to essential tools." This is made better by Open Canvas, which allows up to five apps to run simultaneously.</p><h2 id="pumped-with-ai-2">Pumped with AI </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HXdMerPXu7oe6dFXf63TPd" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-homescreen-widgets" alt="The new widget corner design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXdMerPXu7oe6dFXf63TPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What is an OS upgrade that isn't fuelled by AI? OnePlus' OxygenOS 16 comes with an AI Efficiency suite that consists of several tools that will help with almost everything a user may need. To start, "AI Writer" offers tools like mind maps, charts, and social media caption generation, so you won't have to download multiple apps that do the same thing. While "AI Scan" quickly turns documents, whiteboards, and receipts into clear, editable PDFs, so you don't have to look for a free PDF editor online.</p><p>OnePlus is really pushing the boundaries with these insane photo editing tools. AI Portrait Glow makes your photos look great, no matter the lighting, and AI Perfect Shot fine-tunes everything. It pulls images of the user from your gallery and lets you swap your face in the picture you just clicked! Plus, users also get to test out new AI features that haven't yet been released, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch">YumSee and Party Up</a>, which the company teased a few weeks ago.</p><p>Google Gemini syncs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space</a> to give you personalized, smart help by tapping into your saved info. This means you get really detailed, custom answers, like whipping up a home decor plan using your interior design content you saved, turning your ideas into actual projects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-mind-space-gemini" alt="Integrating Mind Space on the OnePlus 13 with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, OxygenOS 16 is making things seamless when it comes to connecting with devices in different ecosystems. It makes sharing and connecting with your Windows and Mac PCs super easy. It also works even better with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> for synced notifications and lets you control your phone camera from your watch, while also letting you sync your health and fitness metrics.</p><p>OxygenOS 16 Open Beta launches tomorrow (Oct. 17), giving users early access to these new features. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15 </a>will ship with OxygenOS 16, followed by a broader rollout to other devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While I'm jealous of that, I'm glad that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">Pixel 10 Pro Fold battery exploded</a> during a durability test. Yeah, that sounds strange, but it gives me more chances to talk about something important to me: batteries and safety. A couple more articles about it can't hurt, right?</p><p>I want to say up front that Zack knew this might happen. He knows it might happen with every phone he bends until it breaks, because that is the nature of the type of batteries (lithium-based) in phones. Fortunately, he also knows what to do when it happens. It's called <strong>thermal runaway</strong>, and it's kind of crazy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.61%;"><img id="SYJYaRZAidcwx2YoymGgBK" name="exploded-note-7.jpg" alt="An exploded Galaxy Note 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SYJYaRZAidcwx2YoymGgBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="620" height="413" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Thermal runaway occurs when something causes a spot in the battery to heat up, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction that heats adjacent spots until everything becomes hot enough to burn. It's chemical in nature, and while not unique to batteries, it's an important process to understand just a little. You need to be aware of what's inside your pocket.</p><p>The crazy part is how it can start. Physical damage, like bending a phone that's already broken or even just dropping it the "wrong" way, can do it, but so can sitting in the hot sun, manufacturer defects, and (you knew this was coming) just charging it.</p><p>A phone battery uses chemicals to store energy, and some of those chemicals shouldn't ever come into contact with each other. When that happens, things get bad.</p><h2 id="is-it-dangerous-2">Is it dangerous?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA" name="android-multitasking-ui-oneplus-pixel-nothing-honor-motorola-vivo-02" alt="Showing the different multitasking UIs on six different Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes. No. Maybe.</p><p>Every phone can have a catastrophic battery failure (a fancy word for an explosion). Every company making phones and the batteries that go into them does everything they can to prevent it. You'll probably never see it happen, let alone have it happen to you. Unless you watch YouTube, that is.</p><p>That's a bit problematic. Since it rarely happens, most people don't pay much attention when someone mentions how dangerous a lithium battery can be. It might be called an explosion, but it's not like a bomb or anything. It's a mess of gooey chemicals that burn for a long time, ignite everything they touch, and can be difficult to put out.</p><p>Different things have been done to lessen the effects, like putting vents in sealed batteries and using thin, flexible cases instead of a hard plastic shell, but until battery tech changes (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">it will eventually</a>), there is no way to 100% prevent it from ever happening.</p><p>That's what people mean when they say phone batteries are dangerous. Tigers can be dangerous, and just because you're likely to never encounter one doesn't make them any less so.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-2">What can you do?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m3SYYhQut9csQbYqKKjZ9G" name="InfinaCore P3 Pro" alt="InfinaCore P3 Pro 65W GaN travel charger against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m3SYYhQut9csQbYqKKjZ9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not much. As mentioned, there are other people working to ensure the battery in your phone isn't likely to have an issue, and they are really good at it. You can trust that your phone is something you can use and carry around without something going haywire inside it.</p><p>Even phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7">Samsung Galaxy Note 7</a>, notorious for having bad batteries, were mostly safe, and you'll find the number of problems wasn't very high. High enough for a recall doesn't mean it will happen to all of them.</p><p>The few things you can do are really just common sense. If your phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-7-and-7-pro-battery-swelling-problem">starts swelling up</a>, stop using it and have it looked at. If your phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metal-vs-plastic-vs-glass-which-best-material-phones">gets bent</a>, stop using it and have it looked at. If your phone suddenly changes behavior while charging or all of a sudden uses all of the battery power, stop using it and have it looked at.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4976" height="2803" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few other things are a little more inconvenient, but still not hard to do. Never leave your phone lying in direct sunlight; treat it like a vampire.

Both chargers are Qi2-certified, which means they're compatible with any Qi2-supported smartphone, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25">iPhone 17</a> lineup.

It features a built-in 1.5m cable and supports up to 25W wireless charging when paired with the right adapter, which isn't bundled in the box. The charger has a compact 58mm footprint and is priced at $35 in the U.S.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-accessories/car-wireless-charger-black-sku-gp-pwu025wibbu/">Car Wireless Charger</a> works similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/my-favorite-car-chargers-with-retractable-usb-c-cables-are-both-30-percent-off-right-now">other car chargers</a> from brands like ESR and Spigen.

Samsung says it is designed to minimize heat buildup during charging. However, it supports a lower 15W output compared to the Single Wireless Charger. The Car Wireless Charger retails for $85 in the U.S.</p><p>While Samsung doesn't yet offer a Galaxy smartphone with built-in Qi2 magnets, you can still use these chargers with official Samsung magnetic cases for devices like the Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>. These phones are Qi2-ready, meaning they can use Qi2 accessories with the help of a case, even though they aren't fully Qi2-certified out of the box.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company has released Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 for Pixel phones after a few weeks of public testing.</p><p>As expected, later QPR beta builds mainly focus on stability and bug fixes, but QPR2 Beta 3 also includes a few new features. The previous QPR2 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-2-rolls-out-for-pixel-users">added customizable icon shapes</a>, and this version makes it easier to add app shortcuts directly to the home screen.</p><p>App shortcuts are not new to Android. They've existed for years and appear when you long-press an app icon. For example, long-pressing the YouTube app reveals shortcuts like Subscriptions, Shorts, and Search. These could previously be added to the home screen, but with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a> QPR2 Beta 3, Google now includes a "+" button beside each shortcut, making it more obvious that they can be pinned to the home screen.</p><h2 id="android-16-qpr2-beta-3-focuses-on-fixes-and-small-tweaks-2">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 focuses on fixes and small tweaks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW" name="Google-Pixel-10-hands-on-display-Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel 10 models with different color home screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VRynWNu5EaptSUgniwKqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are also a few smaller changes in this build. A Live Caption shortcut has been added directly to the volume control menu, and the icons for the microphone, Google Lens, and AI Mode in the home screen search bar are now slightly larger for better visibility.</p><p>Beyond these additions, the update includes several bug fixes. It resolves an issue where Google Play System Updates failed to install for some users, as well as a problem where devices charged to 100% even when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-turn-off-adaptive-charging-on-a-pixel-phone">adaptive charging</a> was turned on.

The highlight of Veo 3.1 is the introduction of "richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism." This final aspect, "enhanced realism," refers to Google's efforts to bring the textures you're describing to more vibrant life in the generated video.</p><p>Google teases that Veo 3.1 boasts "stronger prompt adherence," meaning it should take into account what the user is saying much more seriously. Additionally, Veo 3.1 has been upgraded with improved "audiovisual quality" when converting supplied images to a video.</p><p>There are three other major points Veo 3.1 touches on, but these concern its capabilities in Flow, as it brings audio to existing features, like "Ingredients in Video."</p><p>Google states users leaning on Veo 3.1's aid in Flow can craft their videos with reference images to control "characters, objects, and styles."  Other features like "Frames to Video" for shot control and "Extend," which lets users lengthen their videos to a minute or more, also benefit from Veo 3.1's enhanced audio capabilities.</p><h2 id="imagine-now-visualize-2">Imagine, now visualize</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I06Ef8alr2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of where Veo 3.1 will help Flow, Google states users will find new editing tools for their generated videos. Adding new elements with "Insert" lets users quickly let their imagination alter a scene, while Flow handles "complex details," like shadows.</p><p>Flow will also grab the ability to delete anything from a scene, something straight out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser's</a> playbook.</p><p>While Flow is beginning to receive these updates today (Oct 15), Veo 3.1 is available in the Gemini APU for devs, Vertex AI (Enterprise customers), and the Gemini app.</p><p>We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">introduced to Flow</a> back in May, around the time of Google's I/O event. The company touted the new app as the perfect place for storytellers to take their ideas from their brains to the screen without spending movie-level money. Google tried to set Flow apart by fueling it with Veo 3 (also announced at I/O), Imagen 4, and Gemini.</p><p>Users already had quite a bit of control over their shots, seeing as you could alter the angle, get close-ups, and more, just by using your prompts.</p><p>Now, with what's been announced for Veo 3.1, users can take what Flow was proficient at and take it even further with enhanced audio. Veo 3.1's arrival in the Gemini app takes us back to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">AI update from this summer</a>, where users could lean on the software to turn photos into a quick clip. Veo 3 did all the heavy lifting for that in the Gemini, but with Veo 3.1 rolling out, perhaps there's even more we can soon do.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company's official page for the Robot Phone begins with a prelude, explaining how it considered "what if a device could exist with the super brain of AI, perceiving the world around you in an instant."</p><p>The video for the Robot Phone begins by showing the new Magic 8 Pro, before spinning around into the next thing from Honor. The phone's design seems to have taken cues from Apple's newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. In this form, the phone features a triple camera array; however, the camera bar itself is incredibly thick.</p><p>While Honor is likely packing several photography and videography-focused features into this phone, there's one reason the bar is like this: the Robot Phone features a flip-up camera on a gimbal. The teaser freezes on a Robot Phone name drop with the camera flipped up, towering above the top of the phone attentively.</p><p>The video then goes in a different direction, which kind of reminds us of Disney's WALL-E—a curious little robot. Considering Honor's focus on AI, the camera is seemingly where the AI will live when flipped up. It watches the world around you as you move, potentially snapping photos or recording videos for you, so you'll never miss a cute moment from your baby or something random in the city.</p><h2 id="man-machine-2">Man & Machine</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="z4jMoigbdQhDoBLgspGYj4" name="honor-robot-phone-camera-bar-teaser" alt="The Honor Robot Phone teaser, which shows the phone with an Apple iPhone 17 Pro-style camera bar and a flip-up camera on a gimbal." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z4jMoigbdQhDoBLgspGYj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1733" height="975" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI-generated video portion also shows the camera helping a woman shop for a new dress, and then disagrees when she finds something that it doesn't think works for a future event. It then surfaces a more appropriate dress for her.</p><p>Additional information about the Robot Phone, which Honor states will be "revolutionary" with its flip-up camera, isn't available right now. Honor plans to unveil even more about this new phone during MWC Barcelona 2026. For those curious for more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/events/honor-robot-phone/#:~:text=to%20Watch%20Video-,HONOR%20ROBOT%20PHONE%20Users%20Wish%20Plan,-Join%20to%20win">you can sign up to win</a> a few goodies, like "Exclusive Progress Updates," "Co-creation & Feedback" chances, and "Priority Trial Access," meaning you could be one of the first few to try this phone.</p><p>Honor has been on this massive future-forward AI kick since February, when it announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-alpha-plan-mwc-2025-tease">Alpha Plan</a>. While it kind of seems like we're just getting the same AI features repackaged with different branding from different companies, Honor's trying to really break the mold for a true sci-fi future.</p><p>This was reiterated earlier this morning (Oct 15) when Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-series-debut-redefines-on-device-ai-imaging-on-device-needs">launched the Magic 8 Pro</a> with its upgraded YOYO AI, the Magic Color photography engine, and more. This unveiling also briefly teased the "Robot Phone," to which Honor said would mark a "significant milestone" in its Alpha Plan strategy. The company is looking to merge and redefine the human-machine experience with coexistence that makes sense.</p><p>If the Robot Phone's camera is as curious as this teaser makes it seem, perhaps that's where we're headed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Spotify, its updates rolling out this week are coming off the back of user requests, such as one consistent interest in "text requests." Beginning this week, Premium users using the DJ will find an option to type their song request alongside the typical voice feature.</p><p>Spotify says the AI DJ will adapt itself to your needs while listening. Joining this new feature are "personalized prompt suggestions." It seems these suggestions are based on your listening history/taste profile. Spotify says that when you're beginning a new DJ session, you can choose from three personalized prompts that encompass a musical genre you enjoy, plus the time of day.</p><p>On the other side, Spotify is rolling out new language support for Spanish-speaking Premium users with the AI DJ.</p><p>This was another prominent community request, as Spotify states users can now voice their interests or write their interests to the AI DJ in Spanish. These updates are rolling out for English and Spanish-speaking Premium users in over 60 markets this week, the U.S. is included.</p><h2 id="keep-the-requests-coming-2">Keep the requests coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dZdUdYsfEfEGdhUNe22x8L" name="spotify-dj-song-request-hero" alt="A banner informing users that Spotify's AI DJ now accepts vocal song request from Premium users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZdUdYsfEfEGdhUNe22x8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1223" height="688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had Spotify's AI DJ could a couple of years now, and, earlier this year, the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-dj-voice-song-requests-premium-details">updated it with song requests</a>. It started as a voice-only feature that lets users on Android long-press the DJ icon when listening to speak their request. Users can tell the DJ what song they'd like, who it's by, and so on. However, you can also get a little more personal, asking the DJ to play songs based on your mood or even a particular genre you want.</p><p>As Spotify reiterates, if you're not seeing the DJ on your homepage, then you can search for "DJ." After which, you can tap on it and begin listening to music curated by the AI, using your listening history as its backbone.</p><p>It's also worth not forgetting about Spotify's big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Lossless Listening</a> update that started rolling out in September.

Lossless Listening is for Premium users only, and offers its rich and deep sound to private playlists, liked songs, DJ, Jam, Mix, AI Playlists, and Daylists.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's practically gone."</p><p>Interestingly, Samsung had already started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leaked-galaxy-s26-edge-cad-renders-reveal-its-peculiar-design">development on the Galaxy S26 Edge</a>, which raises the possibility that it could still appear at a later date — though the report suggests this is highly unlikely now.</p><p>Earlier leaks suggested that Samsung was planning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">replace the Plus model with the Edge version</a> in the Galaxy S26 lineup.

With the S26 Edge now reportedly canceled, it seems Samsung is reverting to its traditional three-phone lineup.</p><p>There are still several months to go before Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy S26 series, but if these reports are accurate, it's safe to say goodbye to the short-lived Edge lineup.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="75b548b1-c87f-48ec-830e-4f6a23fe14ad">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKTvKqpiSi4SNKmBvZ7CGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>At an all-time low</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge offers a powerful processor in a thin and light form factor.

As the name suggests, the feature lets users simply type what they want changed or edited in a photo, and Google Photos, powered by Gemini in the background, makes those edits without any manual input.</p><p>In the editing interface, you will see a new "Help me edit" text field at the bottom of the screen, where you can describe the desired changes. Until now, the feature was exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10</a> phones in the U.S., but Google is now expanding it to more Android devices in the region.</p><h2 id="this-ai-upgrade-makes-photo-editing-effortless-2">This AI upgrade makes photo editing effortless</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1987px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.33%;"><img id="YfuzPLz869LE7RUseWqf5B" name="photos-conversational-editing" alt="Conversational editing in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfuzPLz869LE7RUseWqf5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1987" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the rollout is limited to "eligible" users. According to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">support page</a>, you must be 18 years or older, have your Google account language set to English (U.S.), enable Face Groups in Google Photos, and turn on location estimates to access the feature.</p><p>If you meet these requirements, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/how-to-tips-editing-prompts/">says</a> the update should reach your device pretty soon. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/14/google-photos-conversational-editing-is-now-available-for-most-us-based-android-users/">9to5Google</a>, the feature is already rolling out to non-Pixel devices like the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>Google, in its blog post, highlights that conversational editing isn't limited to basic tweaks like brightening or enhancing photos. It can handle complex edits such as removing reflections, expanding an image's frame, or even restoring faded photos. The feature can also interpret more creative prompts, like visualizing a future home setup.</p><p>The company also highlighted the new Create tab in Google Photos, which now features an improved collage creator and an upgraded photo-to-video generator, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">already rolled out</a> to users, making it easier to turn memories into shareable clips.</p> ]]></dc:content>
