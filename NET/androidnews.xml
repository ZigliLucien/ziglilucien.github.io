                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Black Friday weekend has turned into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> week, which means we're already seeing some great deals on devices. The Pixel Watch 3 is one such device, and though it may be last year's model, this is still one of our favorite smartwatches and one that I personally use on a daily basis. Lucky for you, this great smartwatch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH">discounted back down to its lowest price</a>, making it one of the more exciting deals I've seen so far.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> normally retails for $299 for the 45mm Wi-Fi variant, a price that has already dropped from its original $399 launch price. Now, Amazon has discounted it even further, meaning you can score a Pixel Watch 3 for as low as $199.99, or spend a little more on the smaller 41mm Pixel Watch 3, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9138ZXM">discounted to just $208.99</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eCxonXXh5ZfjYAADW7vfAK" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-official-render-active-obsidian-side.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eCxonXXh5ZfjYAADW7vfAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Right now, you can save a whopping $100 on the already discounted Piel Watch 3, meaning you pay just $199 for one of the best smartwatches on the market. This is the lowest price we've seen for the Pixel Watch 3, so don't wait to snag this deal!</p><p><strong>Price check:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-obsidian-band-wi-fi-matte-black-2024/J39TC87JGQ" data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>$199 at Best Buy</strong></a> <strong>| </strong><a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3"><strong>$199 at Google</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday week is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a good Android smartwatch with decent battery life, access to apps like Spotify and Gemini, and connect to Fitbit for comprehensive health and fitness guidance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer to have the latest and greatest devices, as the Pixel Watch 3 is a year old and uses an even older chipset. Also if you're more serious about fitness, in which case, a Garmin watch may better suit your needs.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 may be a year old, but that doesn't make it an outdated watch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> chipset that powers it still performs admirably, and you won't notice any hiccups. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-major-wear-os-6-upgrade-rolls-out-for-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Wear OS</a> has come a long way, and it feels like a mature smartwatch OS with well-optimized apps and experiences, like the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/how-change-google-pixel-watch-theme">add and change themes</a> based on your watch face.</p><p>I've owned the Pixel Watch 3 for some time now, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> is technically a better watch with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">newer chipset</a> and AI features you won't currently find on its predecessor, I've never felt the desire to upgrade to Google's latest. Battery life has consistently been pretty great for me, with the Pixel Watch 3 lasting two or more days on average, including tilt-to-wake, sleep tracking, and daily workout tracking.</p><p>If you can manage a larger watch, go for the 45mm variant, as the battery will be better than the 41mm version. I would also suggest opting for a Wi-Fi model; I have LTE, but I find that I rarely use it, and it's just a waste of money on my monthly phone bill.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The update, with firmware version CYK2, introduces a new interface. Now, instead of moving between separate screens, you see stacked tiles that organize important information more clearly.

This <em>isn't</em> one of those times. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream-2024/J3ZYG2KQ89"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 has dipped to $129 (48% off)</strong></a>, its lowest price ever by $20, and there's no reason to assume that price will fall lower. This is an everything-must-go sale, and the only question is how long the stock will last.</p><p>Having covered Galaxy Watch deals in Black Fridays past, I remember Samsung followed this pattern with the Galaxy Watch 6, dropping the price by 50% down to $139 before Black Friday and sticking to it through Cyber Monday. After that, Samsung took it off storefronts, and you could only find "renewed" models.</p><p>You can play chicken with Samsung and hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> falls even further, but I wouldn't risk it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88">Amazon's storefront</a> already says "Deal selling fast," which shows that people know this is a steal of a deal. You're paying Amazfit money for a powerful smartwatch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, Play Store apps, and Gemini smarts, along with the promise of feature updates through late 2028.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9f6a0e97-d1eb-4408-b997-4fc34bca3bf5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off)" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off)" data-dimension25="$129.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream-2024/J3ZYG2KQ89" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>or: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-44mm-bt-green-2024/J3ZYG2KQYF" data-dimension112="9f6a0e97-d1eb-4408-b997-4fc34bca3bf5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off)" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off)" data-dimension25="$129.99"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off)</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 may have been supplanted by the Galaxy Watch 8, but many of you will prefer the traditional rounded look of this generation, and Samsung made very few changes this generation: You're getting the same Exynos chip, RAM, and storage, with comparable battery life and most of the same health sensors.</p><p>Our old pick for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a>, the Galaxy Watch 7 comes in 1.3- or 1.5-inch display sizes, offers Samsung Health AI insights like Energy Score, and receives the longest software support of any Wear OS watch, beating the Pixel and OnePlus watches.

But is this enough for you to give up such an absurdly low price?</p><p>You should also decide whether you're willing to spend another $30 for the Galaxy Watch 7 44mm, or $50 more for LTE connectivity. The 1.3-inch Galaxy Watch 7 looks more natural on smaller wrists, while the 1.5-inch Watch 7 resizes content to take advantage of its larger screen.</p><p>Otherwise, you'll need to look at other Wear OS watch brands, and your options are limited.

As the name implies, this updated version of Nano Banana was built off the Gemini 3 Pro model with aspirations of bringing two major upgrades to users and their generated images. To begin, Google says Nano Banana Pro is now more proficient at "generating context-rich visuals."</p><p>The purpose of such images is for users who are creating photos meant to offer information—accurately—for a wider audience. Google states that diagrams and "content-rich" infographics based on images you've given the AI should be more helpful than before. Moreover, facts that you've personally provided to the AI for it to consider and implement are now enhanced.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro is now capable of piggybacking off Google Search. If you're looking to showcase a recipe with hunger-inducing visuals, Nano Banana Pro can grab those recipe details and photos and put them together.</p><p>The second update involves images with text. Google says it has worked to improve the legibility of text in photos generated by Nano Banana Pro. Now, AI-created photos with text using a variety of calligraphy, textures, and fonts should appear clearer, as well as the added ability for users to generate text in multiple languages.</p><h2 id="go-bananas-like-a-pro-2">Go bananas like a Pro</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQsJIo46ZR8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Of course, what Nano Banana got popular for was being an image generator, and that's what Google is also upgrading. This new Pro version is said to have upgraded its "consistency by design," meaning the AI can now blend/merge images more consistently. Users can lean on more images (up to 14) and watch the AI merge them in ways you'd like. Elsewhere, new "creative controls" are coming in to help users alter the angle of the generated photo, alter its focus, and more.</p><p>So, while Nano Banana Pro takes the more refined, complex approach to image generation, Google says the original Nano Banana is still there for quicker, generated fun.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro is rolling out today (Nov 20) in the Gemini app for consumers and students. Users on the free tier will have a "limited free quota" with the Pro version before the app tosses you back to the O.G. Nano Banana. Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers will see higher use quotas. In AI Mode, Nano Banana Pro is available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.</p><p>Developers and those using Flow are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/#:~:text=How%20you%20can%20try%20Nano%20Banana%20Pro%20today">also receiving the update</a>.</p><p>Nano Banana is relatively new, as Google first launched it toward the end of August. The feature quickly captivated users interested in trying it, as the company reported a whopping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">10 million new Gemini app users</a> because of it. In September, Google already stated the generator was responsible for over 200 million images generated.

However, the AI scholar and trailblazer that led the company's research efforts for over a decade is now leaving Meta to create a new startup. Yann LeCun, Meta's vice president and chief AI scientist, will depart to build a company aiming to "bring about the next revolution in AI."</p><p>The company continues LeCun's research on Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI), which he has studied as part of Meta's FAIR research devision and at New York University as a professor. LeCun will remain at Meta until the end of this year, and says more details about the new company will be shared later. Critically, we do know that Meta will partner with LeCun's new company "because of their continued interest and support."</p><p>LeCun confirmed his upcoming departure in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7I2jlco?xmt=AQF0sZXdrCADKkSp3bU1SIZCLME_gTCUbXRPam80ZebSAw" target="_blank">post on Threads</a> and other social platforms Wednesday, Nov. 19.</p><div><blockquote><p>I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.</p><p>Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta </p></blockquote></div><p>Most consumer AI products currently available are large language models (LLM), which have a sizable knowledge base from written text and other works. However, LLMs struggle to stay current or provide a deep understanding of the world. With LeCun's AMI program, the researcher aims to build world models that deliver reasoning, knowledge, and capabilities that come close to or match that of the human mind.</p><p>"As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not," LeCun writes. "Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact."</p><p>The shakeup will put Meta's FAIR research division in new hands for the first time since its inception. It comes at a time when Meta is acquiring AI talent and companies to compete with the likes of Google, OpenAI, and others.</p><p>"The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular," LeCun says. "The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Once this arrives, when tapping Quick Share to send a file to another phone, users with a Pixel 10 should begin to pick up iPhones. This new capability is said to work vice versa, as well.</p><p>Though these are different (even competitive) devices on different operating systems, Google said it built this capability "with security at its core."</p><p>The company states it has tested its "strong safeguards" with "independent security experts" to ensure that the data you're sending between devices remains protected. It's worth mentioning that so long as your Android device and iPhone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9286773">are prepared to receive files from others</a>, this Quick Share/AirDrop update will work seamlessly. Moreover, Google says this won't stay a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> exclusive ability.</p><p>The post states that the company will look to improve how Quick Share and AirDrop function alongside one another, as well as looking to offer this update to "more Android devices." There's no timeline set for this just yet, so it's unclear how long other phones will be waiting.</p><h2 id="android-ios-look-like-the-best-of-friends-2">Android & iOS look like the best of friends</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.77%;"><img id="iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY" name="google-apple-quick-share-airdrop-update" alt="Google's Pixel 10 series can now use Quick Share to send files to users with an iPhone's AirDrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="860" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This update should begin rolling out today (Nov 20) for the devices involved, so keep your eyes peeled for it.</p><p>This is, in essence, a major update for how Android and iOS (Google and Apple) work with one another, following the whole RCS situation. Last September, Apple started rolling out RCS on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">iPhones through iOS 18</a>. This update finally brought read receipts, sharper photos, and an overall well-improved chatting experience between iPhones and Android devices that previously leveraged the old, clunky SMS standard. This was everything Google was fighting for in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">#GetTheMessage campaign</a>, even if it had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">nothing to do with its implementation</a> in the end.</p><p>However, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/apple-gsma-rcs-encryption-standrd-update-confirmed">wasn't until earlier this year</a> that iPhones got the E2EE (end-to-end encryption) side of that RCS update, which is really what we're all here for. The GSM Association announced the new RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which brought encryption to RCS. Why this might seem strange (since Google Messages has encryption), RCS never had encryption levels like that. Google was the one that implemented it for users. Now, with the RCS standard as a whole adopting stronger protections for user messages, everyone can get in on it, including Apple's iPhones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From heavy-hitters like the recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Deadpool VR</a> to the return of classics like Thief VR, there's no shortage of games to play on your Meta Quest this holiday season. But one stands out from the rest for me because of its polish and near-perfect gameplay execution: Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked.</p><p>This long title, which I'll just shorten to Demeo x D&D from here on out, builds upon the successful turn-based strategy card battler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo</a> with the expansive universe of Dungeons & Dragons. While I played it on the Meta Quest 3 the entire time, the game is also available on Steam and PlayStation in both VR and non-VR versions, so you can play with all of your friends, no matter their platform of choice. Yes, that means VR players can play with non-VR players just as Demeo allowed.</p><p>Demeo is out now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014283/" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked/7239148276178939/" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a> for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong>, an unbelievable value when you consider that the substantially shorter Demeo was $39.99 for the longest time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Each battle takes place on a "board" composed of movement squares, but each board is lavishly decorated to look like a convincing location rather than a simple board game.</p><p>During a battle, players can choose to carry out two actions per turn. Each player has a hand of cards that contains attacks or items to use, or an action point can be spent moving on the board. If you've played D&D, you'll be immediately familiar with some of the mechanics, although the card-based abilities shake up gameplay in a meaningful way from standard D&D.</p><p>Like D&D, you may randomly come across an encounter or trap that requires you to roll a die to either pass or fail the test. Each of the eight playable classes can specialize in a number of different traits, and each of these traits plays a role in combat, traps, and even dialogue.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Fighting battles in mixed reality in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The game features two main campaigns at launch, each of which spans dozens of hours and locations to complete. Players can save and stop at any time, resuming their saved campaign with or without other players. Developer Resolution Games recommends always starting with four characters when playing a campaign, and these characters can be controlled by you or other human players.</p><p>Combat isn't the only thing players can do here, either. During each campaign, players will visit locations like taverns that allow them to chat with NPCs, investigate locations and objects, accept side quests, and more.</p><p>Three "one-shot" campaigns are also included in the launch game, adding even more variety and replayability to the game. The game can be played in VR or on a traditional TV/monitor system setup, giving you freedom to choose how you prefer to play this epic strategy title.</p><h2 id="what-s-different-from-regular-demeo-2">What's different from regular Demeo?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uZw9c3bkS949eyJBJuWrLJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-ui-flat-vs-vr" alt="The differences in the UI between the VR and non-VR versions of Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZw9c3bkS949eyJBJuWrLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base battle gameplay is similar to Demeo in that each character on the board takes turns moving and attacking, with players utilizing abilities from a deck of cards in their hand. But the basic structure of the rest of these games is quite different.</p><p>In Demeo, players choose from a half-dozen campaigns to play through. Each campaign is made up of three "floors." The first floor is usually a medium-sized area, the second floor is typically a much larger area with more challenging groups of enemies, and the third floor is a boss battle. Players stop at "Cleepto's Bazaar" between each floor to shop and trade cards with the merchant NPC.</p><p>In Demeo x D&D, players always begin at a map of the campaign's world and choose areas to visit from there. Each area is bespoke and has no set size. Some sidequests may be made up of a single forested area with a handful of enemies, while other sidequests may be multi-floor dungeons with dozens of enemies. You'll also come across plenty of areas where fighting is not an option, allowing you to move freely around to investigate areas or talk to NPCs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="zSG5W79XqSXZLginCWZshm" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-map" alt="Choosing a location to visit on the world map in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSG5W79XqSXZLginCWZshm.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Demeo x D&D has a much more traditional RPG structure in this respect. You can follow the main campaign or get sidetracked as often as you'd like, exploring each of the game's diorama-sized areas to your heart's content. Cleepto's Bazaar still exists in Demeo X D&D, but now it's a dedicated part of the world that you can visit any time you head back to the world map.</p><p>The game saves <em>very</em> often, making it easy to pick up and play. One of the best additions to the original Demeo was a later update that added save slots, allowing you to stop and save, then pick up the action at a later time. Demeo x D&D supercharges this mechanic by dropping a save slot on each player's system, allowing them to continue the campaign you were playing together on their own or with completely different people.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CZ3oUk2DxBWxJqB3HhcGJJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-random-trap" alt="Encountering a random trap during a battle in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZ3oUk2DxBWxJqB3HhcGJJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a brilliant mechanic that gives you the freedom to play when you want instead of having to perform a miracle and get all four players' adult schedules lined up. Public multiplayer lobbies are available just as they were in the original Demeo, and I'm hoping the crowd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">is just as friendly</a>.</p><p>And unlike Demeo, the characters in Demeo x D&D are customizable. You can paint colors on them in a basic way, and each character has a skill tree that you'll build out as you progress through the campaigns. As you might hope, those skills transfer between campaigns and can make things much easier as you go. One-shot campaigns use new characters each time, which is typical of D&D.</p><h2 id="how-about-a-local-demeo-x-d-d-night-2">How about a local Demeo x D&D night?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u8CKsekihTrZ2noFhq8fK9" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-official-screenshot-02" alt="Official gameplay screenshots from the non-VR version of Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8CKsekihTrZ2noFhq8fK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Resolution Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the <em>very</em> coolest features of Demeo x D&D is the ability to play the game together with other people in the same room. Using the built-in co-location feature, Meta Quest players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-played-virtual-dandd-on-a-real-table-with-the-quest-pro-and-it-was-amazing">can place the board on a real table</a> as if it were a real board game. Everyone sees the same board in the same exact location, so this works as you'd expect (or even just hope to expect).</p><p>I recommend players use only a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S for this, as the color passthrough is a significant upgrade over the nasty, low-res, black-and-white passthrough of the Quest 2. This will make it feel like a "proper" D&D night with friends, albeit with no one having to take the helm of dungeon master.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ax95NEsigzBFeKHjAwmDKJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-conversation" alt="A conversation roll opportunity in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ax95NEsigzBFeKHjAwmDKJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's another area where Demeo x D&D shines. It features several of the stat-based random encounters of D&D, including environmental hazards and enemies alike, plus lots of dialog choices that players can all vote on. It's an incredible way to get that D&D feel without having to put in all the dungeon master work (and that crap is <em>a lot</em> of work).</p><p>All of these new additions and the fact that there are two full campaigns, plus three "one-shot" campaigns, add significant variety to an already impressive game. I also love that this still uses the tried-and-true Demeo style of combat and movement, which helps it feel different from traditional D&D, all while still maintaining enough of that property's soul to feel like the branding belongs here.</p><p>The polish on the visuals, dialogue, voice acting, and gameplay all combine to make this my favorite VR game of the year. Of course, if you're not a VR gamer or have friends who might be interested in playing the game (but don't have a VR headset), don't worry, as Resolution Games ensured cross-platform play works perfectly. I played with some friends using the non-VR Steam client, and things were as smooth as I had hoped. It's a must-have title on the Meta Quest, for sure, and a must-buy game for D&D and strategy gamers, as a whole.</p><h2 id="faq-2">FAQ</h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What platforms is Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked available on?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked is available on Meta Quest, Steam, and PlayStation platforms.

That means Meta Quest gamers can play the same game together with a non-VR Steam player, and even match up with PlayStation players in the same game. Demeo supports up to four players max.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Does Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked use the same rules as D&D?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While Demeo x D&D sports classic Dungeons & Dragons lore and locations, the game's ruleset is based heavily on Demeo and not traditional D&D. Chance encounters, like random monsters, conversations, or traps that require a roll, use familiar 20-sided dice rolls to pass a requirement, but players cannot choose to "do anything they want" in the same way they can in a traditional D&D game.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>If you’ve ever wished you could message a friend directly in YouTube instead of bouncing to WhatsApp or Instagram, you might soon get your wish. YouTube is quietly testing built-in direct messaging, starting in two countries for now.</p><p>After years of pushing users toward public comments and Community posts, the platform is testing a DM revival in Ireland and Poland, though you must be 18 or older to access the feature, as per YouTube's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=388556429" target="_blank">support page</a>. To get started, tap the notification bell on any long-form video, Short, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/minimum-streaming-age-youtube-requirement-increases-parents-details">live stream</a>. Then, hit "Invite others to share videos," and you can send an invite to another user. Once the recipient accepts, the conversation kicks off. If they’d rather not, they can decline.</p><p>You can also block or report someone if the chat gets messy. Messages aren’t fully private, though, as YouTube notes that they “may be reviewed” for Community Guidelines issues, so this isn’t aiming to replace your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp or Signal.</p><p>A separate YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16650958#zippy=%2Cinvite-others-to-share-content-accept-invites%2Cshare-when-watching-content" target="_blank">support page</a> notes that invite links expire seven days after they're created. So, make sure you've turned on notifications for YouTube to get notified when someone sends you a chat invite in the app.</p><p>You can also just hit the Share button under any video and pick who you want to send it to, or tap “Invite to share on YouTube” if you need to invite them first.</p><h2 id="this-is-youtube-s-second-attempt-2">This is YouTube's second attempt</h2><p>This isn't YouTube's first rodeo with DMs. The platform launched an in-app messaging system between 2017 and 2019 but eventually shut it down, arguing that the platform needed to prioritize public discussion, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/19/youtube-is-testing-a-revival-of-built-in-direct-messages-a-top-feature-request/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> points out. That was before TikTok rewired how people discover and share content and before short-form clips became a core part of social conversation.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, and YouTube clearly doesn’t want to keep losing those share-and-react moments to other apps. For viewers, the immediate benefit is simply less friction. Instead of copying a link, jumping into a separate chat app, and then diving back into YouTube, you’d be able to keep the discussion right where you found the video.</p><p>For creators and brands, this feature could help build small communities, share exclusive content, and encourage more personal interactions without relying on other platforms. However, the privacy trade-off is important, and YouTube’s monitoring policy may affect whether people use or avoid the feature.</p><p>What happens next will depend on how users react in the next few months. YouTube hasn’t promised to launch this feature worldwide; for now, it’s just a trial to see how things go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is also true of Chromebooks, and Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/geforce-now-fast-pass">announced a new partnership</a> with NVIDIA, introducing GeForce NOW Fast Pass.</p><p>With this announcement, Google states that "GeForce NOW Fast Pass allows users to stream over 2000 PC games directly to their Chromebooks." Since GeForce NOW was already available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, you might be wondering what the big deal is.</p><p>Well, if you're an existing Free Tier subscriber, you'll likely find yourself stuck waiting for ads before actually being able to jump into a game. Fast Pass "eliminates ads, so you can just fire up your Chromebook, connect a controller, and start playing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HBgqZieQ5zYmd5yWUYGba8" name="acer-chromebook-516-ge-cyberpunk-2.jpg" alt="Cyberpunk on Acer Chromebook 516 GE alt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HBgqZieQ5zYmd5yWUYGba8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some limitations, as it seems that Fast Pass isn't an alternative to the Performance or Ultimate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/premium-memberships/">GeForce NOW subscriptions</a>. Instead, it can be seen as more of a supplement, as you're limited to "10 hours of gaming per month, with up to five unused hours rolling over." For comparison, both Performance and Ultimate allow for up to 100 hours of monthly playtime, along with an abundance of additional features.</p><p>Google also confirmed that anyone who buys a Chromebook starting today (November 20) will get GeForce NOW Fast Pass for free, for one year.

Storage limitations are just one reason why, and that's provided that you're able to even get more than a game or two running. And while there are a bunch of fantastic games available on the Play Store, it's not quite the same as playing a new AAA title.</p><p>Thankfully, cloud gaming solutions such as GeForce NOW, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/backbone-pro-xbox-edition">Xbox Game Pass</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://luna.amazon.com/">Amazon Luna</a> help to fill the gaps.

It showed it off at Google I/O, and apparently, some users on Reddit started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-for-android-auto-is-starting-to-replace-google-assistant">seeing signs of the rollout</a> earlier this month.</p><p>Today, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-auto-gemini-tips">officially announced</a> that Android Auto will indeed be Gemini-fied globally (Nov. 20). With Gemini in your car, you'd be able to get more done on your drive to work. This means you can have lengthy conversations with it and also get more complex tasks done. For instance, Gemini can double as your tour guide and local expert, with it fully integrated in Google Maps.</p><p>Gemini will look at reviews to offer business insights, answer common questions, and help users find and navigate to local spots. If you say, "Hey Google, I need your help. I'm suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?"  Or you can then ask follow-up questions about popular dishes, dog-friendliness, or specific item reviews (like ribs).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="YJBtAnCWvEgC84uwAudsuf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:73,cw:1034,ch:582,q:80/YJBtAnCWvEgC84uwAudsuf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini on Android Auto is all about making your drive seamless; it handles the monotonous tasks for you, allowing you to focus on enjoying your drive. Google explains that you don't need to perfectly dictate texts, start over, or manually add your ETA. It can summarize incoming messages and help you reply confidently.</p><p>You can say,  "Oops, I'm stuck in traffic. Can you let Leo know and add my ETA and a sorry emoji?" and "One more thing. Can you also ask if he wants to grab coffee after the game? And please translate the message into Spanish," with its new ability to translate into over 40 languages, without starting over from scratch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="QDZ8fy2NSGxMypMLGvPFtf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:218,cw:1067,ch:600,q:80/QDZ8fy2NSGxMypMLGvPFtf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, with Gemini's integration into almost every other Google app, you will be able to get it to access your Gmail while still on the move. It can be as simple as asking it to summarize your emails or a more complex task like "Okay, I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?"</p><p>Along with all this, Gemini still helps you "check your calendar, capture to-dos and take notes — now in a much more conversational way," Google said in its press release.</p><p>Speaking of taking over while you drive, Gemini on Android Auto will also act as your brainstorming buddy or someone you'd like to rehearse your speech with, by simply saying, "Hey Google, let's chat about the rehearsal dinner at his parents' house, and I'd like to get them a small something. What are some good ideas…"</p><p>Lastly, what's a ride without some jam sessions? Gemini will be able to curate the perfect playlist for your next road trip, or you could also ask it a more open-ended question, like, "It's pouring outside, could you give me a cozy playlist for a rainy drive?"</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="S6Jet2hRc2uRtvq4nKKjtf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:188,cw:1067,ch:600,q:80/S6Jet2hRc2uRtvq4nKKjtf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the new Gemini AI assistant for Android Auto begins rolling out today, supporting 45 languages.

Activate it by saying "Hey Google," pressing the mic button on the screen, or long-pressing the steering wheel's voice control button.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The good news is that you don't have to wait! Our three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">highest-rated smart glasses</a> are <em>all</em> on sale a full week before Black Friday officially begins, but how do you choose between them?</p><p>All three pairs of glasses provide you with a massive wearable OLED display in a svelte glasses form factor, allowing you to plug them into your smartphone, Steam Deck, laptop, or several other devices. That gives you a personal, private screen that won't hurt your neck. Whether you're looking for the best image quality, lowest price, or widest range of compatible products, I'm here to help you make the right choice <em>today</em>.</p><h2 id="best-overall-smart-display-glasses-2">Best overall smart display glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP" name="xreal-one-side-angle-lenses-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One has been our top choice since it launched earlier this year. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One review</a> will help you understand what makes it the best if you want all the details, but the skinny is that Xreal One glasses come with the industry's first-ever dedicated chipset, allowing it to do things no other pair of glasses can. They're also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC"><strong>down to $399</strong></a>, the lowest price we've seen yet; a full $100 off!</p><p>Paramount to that experience is the ability to "mount" the virtual screen to an imaginary wall in front of you. When you plug Xreal One into any compatible device, the virtual screen in front of you stays in place just as a physical TV or monitor would, so you can move your head or body around normally, and that monitor will stay in place.</p><p>All other smart glasses "pin" the display to your face, which means that even the slightest jitter will make that display jostle and shake, and could give some people sore eyes or motion sickness. Xreal One's powerful chipset keeps this from happening, and the glasses even feature a built-in monitor-like settings menu that lets you fine-tune the image and several other options. Again, something no other pair of smart glasses can do.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bd6374aa-83a8-4a19-9b76-3d041fe5ce2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Take $100 off the normal price and enjoy the power of Xreal One with its dedicated, industry-first X1 chipset.

This dock is only guaranteed to work with Viture's glasses, so it's best to pair Luma Pro with them. Plus, since Luma Pro has the best micro-OLED display on any smart display glasses to date, you'll be thrilled with the image quality here.</p><p>Viture also makes a massive ecosystem of products that work with its glasses, from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">incredible mobile controller</a> that makes your phone display massive, to a crazy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Multi-screen-Assistant-12GB-256GB/dp/B0DRVPMT4T?th=1">Android-powered wearable neckband computer</a> that natively pairs with your glasses and enables remote PS5 play, plus access to other streaming services and Android games.

Reportedly, the device was featured in an all-glass case (likely a prototype model) during the Honor User Carnival event in China. There was a host of Honor products on display, like the Magic 8 series, but what had everyone chatting was the Robot Phone.</p><p>From the Weibo post, the Robot Phone was shown off in a white color option with its curious camera flipped up. The camera is housed within its camera array on its back, but when flipped up, it breathes new life into the device and its AI capabilities. Design-wise, the Robot Phone is pretty similar to the Magic 8 series, that is, with rounded corners, flat seemingly, and potentially a completely flat display.</p><p>The report on Weibo cites a statement (machine-translated) from Honor's CEO, Jian Li, who said, "A technology company is completely devoid of vitality without a little innovation. ROBOT PHONE is just a new game for mobile phones. In the future, glory in different industries will make users proud."</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7490159699/Qep9maBNd">user post on Weibo</a> showed off the Robot Phone in a little more detail with close-up shots. We're able to see just how large the gimbal-like camera is, and the space created within the phone for it to slot into. This model, shown in a black option, gives a little more perspective on its thickness. As expected, it seems the phone will be quite thick, especially around that rear camera array, due to the flip-up camera.</p><h2 id="the-start-of-a-new-phone-era-2">The start of a new phone era?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="hFc4wPnJfeSKqRCkefdCUZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-white-option" alt="A snapshot of the Honor Robot Phone in white, which has its gimbal camera flipped upward." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFc4wPnJfeSKqRCkefdCUZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="690" height="460" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="YthoqAduiGGDEnu3pwyGUZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-black-triple-showcase" alt="Three snapshots of the Honor Robot Phone, showcasing its flip-up gimbal camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YthoqAduiGGDEnu3pwyGUZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:453px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:132.45%;"><img id="MjF9ycArPUdVHNnVdVZeTZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-black-side" alt="The Honor Robot Phone in black from the side, showing off its rather thick camera bar to fit the flip-up camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MjF9ycArPUdVHNnVdVZeTZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="453" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When Honor revealed its Magic 8 series, the company also teased something new: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-teases-a-curious-ai-driven-robot-phone-with-a-flip-up-camera">the Robot Phone</a>. While no one knew quite what that entailed, the company's main page updated to showcase the device in an AI-generated video. It positioned the phone as a curious device, one that has a flip-up camera that can be attentive and react to what you (the user) see and do. The design is also quite reminiscent of the Apple iPhone 17 Pro, especially with the way its camera bar looks.</p><p>The prelude also delivers a question: "What if a device could exist with the super brain of AI, perceiving the world around you in an instant?"</p><p>It seems as if the device can take photos for you, record videos for you, and so much more, to make creating memories a breeze. Honor even showed the phone assisting a woman with finding a dress she might like for the evening. This is all exciting, and the Robot Phone's appearance overseas was a shock, but that's not all we should expect.</p><p>Honor states that it plans to fully unveil the Robot Phone during MWC Barcelona in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-oneplus-15-cases">OnePlus 15 cases</a> that are limited in availability right now, there are loads of options available when it comes to screen guards. Almost every single pick is reasonably priced, includes multiple pieces, and has no front camera cutout. The camera notch tends to collect dust, so it's always best to get a screen guard without one.</p><p>The best overall option is the Orzero OnePlus 15 3 Pack Screen Protector + 3 Pack Camera Lens Protector. You get an excellent deal for $10, and the brand Orzero has good reviews spanning across the last few years. The OnePlus 15 set features three scratch-proof 9H tempered glass screen protectors with rounded edges. You also get three dark tempered glass camera lens protectors for the camera island.</p><p>If you want to take care of your phone case needs simultaneously, why not get a set that includes it all? The Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is made of a really sturdy material called 600D aramid fiber. Thinborne includes a free tempered glass screen protector with every one of its cases, increasing the value for money. At the end of the day, it's still a very expensive set priced at $70. However, you get super high-quality products in exchange.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the listing, the mid-range phone will now receive one extra year of Samsung software support, taking users up from a promised six years to seven. The publication clocked that Samsung will now support the phone from 2025 to 2032 with its software patches.</p><p>However, it seems Samsung is only willing to extend one aspect of its software support: the security side.</p><p>There's a section in Samsung's product listing that highlights its promised Android OS versions and the number of upgrades consumers can expect for a particular device. For the Galaxy A56, that number hasn't updated and remains at six. So, right now, it seems the model will only receive major Android OS upgrades from 2025 to 2031, meaning that last year is just for anything crucial and new with Samsung's security.</p><p>A user on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/mobile-apps-services/samsung-extending-software-updates-to-some-mid-range-devices/td-p/13644948">Samsung Community forum</a> noticed this, too, citing a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2025/11/13/samsung-extends-7-year-updates-to-many-devices/">Sammy Fans</a> about a few more extensions. It seems Samsung has also quietly extended its support for the Galaxy A36, Galaxy Tab A11, and Galaxy Tab A11 Plus. All of these devices have been reportedly brought up to seven years, which, in a way, mirrors Samsung's flagships.</p><h2 id="making-the-best-of-the-budget-2">Making the best of the budget</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4rHh2GsxgNSQfbs6n26svi" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rHh2GsxgNSQfbs6n26svi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-hits-retailers-nationwide-us-debut">were patiently waiting</a> for the next Galaxy A series phone to arrive, especially after the company skipped out on the Galaxy A55 a year prior.

You wouldn't want to mar such a wonderful trait with a bulky phone cover. This is why I highly recommend getting a sleek and lightweight case for your OnePlus 15.</p><p>So many of the best OnePlus 15 cases are from OnePlus itself. However, due to the delay in FCC certification, both the phone and its cases have been delayed. This is why it's really hard to find either product in stock in the U.S. right now. This leaves you with two choices: You can either buy something available right now, or wait patiently until the cover of your choice is released.</p><p>Of the cases available right now, the Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is the best option for your device. It measures only 0.04 inches wide, is made of robust 600D aramid fiber, has strong magnets, and even comes with a tempered glass screen protector. While Thinborne's sleek offering is pretty expensive, it is an all-in-one solution that you can purchase in North America immediately, making it a great pick.</p><p>I also like Nillkin's Super Frosted Shield Pro Magnetic Matte Case because it has a dotted, textured back that is incredibly grippy. The entire case is built well and fits the OnePlus 15 rather snugly. I have used plenty of Nillkin cases before, and they usually last a good while, between two to three years on average.</p><p>Play the long game, and you can get any of the wonderful first-party OnePlus 15 cases listed in this guide. However, be sure to get a cheap in-between case as you wait for the official cases to go on sale. Something like the clear case from Foluu only costs about $7, making it an ideal temporary solution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's probably why you're wondering which OnePlus 15 color you should buy. There are three colorways to choose with this iteration, each available in 16GB/512GB as well as 12GB/256GB storage options.

A phone is such a personal possession. It often reflects who we are as people. Thus, picking a colorway when buying a phone is not always as straightforward.</p><p>I'm in love with the OnePlus 15 in Ultra Violet because it's one of my favorite colors. And if there's one thing about people who love purple, they go all in on that obsession. But my feral attachment to the shade aside, Ultra Violet is the most unique offering with the 15 series. It has a fantastic duochrome hue with a purple and opal mixture. The matte finish somehow subdues and enhances the color shift at the same time, and the shiny purple frame looks luxurious.</p><p>But if you're not big on colorful shades, then the monochrome options like the beige Sand Storm and plain black Infinite Black are probably better suited for you. Scratches and dirt stand out more on lighter colors like Sand Storm, so if you're planning on using the OnePlus 15 without a phone case, I'd suggest opting for Infinite Black to play it safe.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm not a big fan of AI in general, but the one use case that makes a difference in what I do is transcribing audio to text. I attend a lot of briefings and meetings, and the ability to just have key notes transcribed automatically is just convenient (I used to waste hours doing this manually). I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/flowtica-scribe-ai-enabled-pen-has-transformed-how-i-attend-meetings">Flowtica's Scribe recorder</a> in the last two months, and I enjoyed the novelty of it — it's just great to be able to record everything and have it transcribed automatically.</p><p>Plaud is another brand that offers a similar product; it's billed as the number one AI note-taking brand, and I've been testing the Plaud Note to see how it holds up. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plaud.ai/products/plaud-note-ai-voice-recorder">Note usually retails at $159</a>, but as with all things AI, there's a monthly plan — the Unlimited tier is $239 a year (I know), and the Pro plan has 20 hours of transcribing a month and costs $99 annually. The device comes with a Starter plan included, and that just covers five hours of AI-assisted transcribing, which is just insultingly low. On the bright side, the Note is currently on sale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PLAUD-Transcribe-Summarize-Empowered-Languages/dp/B0CZX48H2Z">bringing the cost down to $127</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2030226a-f027-4b87-abd4-b49897da180f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Note is useful if you attend a lot of meetings, and as a dedicated recorder, it doesn't have any issues.

The industrial design is much better than other AI-enabled products I used, and it has pogo pins to charge the internal battery.</p><p>It attaches to the back of a phone via the bundled magnetic ring or the leather case. I went with the included leather case as it's just easier. Using the Plaud Note is about as straightforward as it gets; just download the Plaud app (it's available on the App Store and Play Store), connect the device with the app by pressing down the button, and you can get started.</p><p>There's a single button on the device, and a long press starts recording. There's an LED light on the Plaud logo that glows red when it's recording, and it serves as a good visual indicator. You'll just need to press the button again to end a recording, and the recorded data is transferred to the connected phone automatically — although it might take a while if it's a long recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="HdbAEvhR3PuaqoqZyDZ77C" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdbAEvhR3PuaqoqZyDZ77C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're using the Note in a meeting, you can short press anytime in between to highlight that section, and this is honestly a decent addition. There's also a toggle on the device that lets you record phone calls; this is a pretty decent use case of the product if you need the feature.</p><p>Once you get the data into the Plaud app, it automatically starts transcribing the audio. It uses the GPT-5 model to transcribe, and it did a standout job in this regard — it didn't make any notable errors. Also, you can choose your AI model, with Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4 also available.</p><p>What I like the most about the Plaud app is that it has the ability to pull key quotes, provide detailed summaries, and so much more. If anything, this is the key differentiator for the product, and it did a much better job than I thought.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fTyFkYCZv2YUDDqjyyY8yB" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTyFkYCZv2YUDDqjyyY8yB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="dGjrcsCSEcPtJ4ZMio3NsB" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dGjrcsCSEcPtJ4ZMio3NsB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5005" height="2819" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2qniNRj3ssJVwuvv5naV6C" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2qniNRj3ssJVwuvv5naV6C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CRG9B6MDyjsPQTbquUCR9C" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRG9B6MDyjsPQTbquUCR9C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>At this point, you may be asking, "Wait, I have a recorder on my phone, and that basically does the same thing. So why do I need to buy this thing?" That's a good question! Honestly, with how much phone recorders have changed in the last 12 months, you don't need a dedicated device like the Plaud Note. Google's Recorder on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> in particular is terrific, and it does a great job recording and summarizing.</p><p>Heck, this isn't even limited to Pixels. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> has a built-in recorder that leverages AI, and not only does it automatically transcribe audio, but it also generates summaries on its own. The best part is that you don't need to pay anything to use these utilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BEHHE5BDBS6LA4BSJSo9zB" name="Plaud Note" alt="Plaud Note review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BEHHE5BDBS6LA4BSJSo9zB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the Plaud Note is a nice tool in its own right, and it does a great job transcribing meetings and providing actionable context. As a dedicated product, it is plenty useful in its own right, and the design is gorgeous. It has decent standby battery life as well, and the small size means you can take it anywhere, or just have it attached to your phone. If you're a student or an exec who attends a lot of meetings, I can see this coming in handy, but the monthly cost is ultimately a huge limitation.</p><p>Whether you actually need it comes down to whether you're willing to pay the monthly fee on top of what the hardware costs just to get the most out of the product. If so, then yes, you should get the Plaud Note — it does a better job than any other AI note-taking device I used. If you just need basic transcribing and summarization, your Android phone does that without any issues. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PLAUD-Transcribe-Summarize-Empowered-Languages/dp/B0CZX48H2Z">at $127</a>, you can pay a little less to get the device itself, but you need to act now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That said, I didn't like the WH-1000XM5; the design just wasn't great, and their inability to fold inward made the headset a bad choice to take on the road.</p><p>That's why I was excited to use the WH-1000XM6. While Sony didn't mess with the audio drivers too much, the WH-1000XM6 has a much better design; the hinge has a folding mechanism, and the headset is once again travel-friendly. The case itself isn't anywhere as bulky as its predecessor, and I was able to slot it into my travel bag with relative ease.</p><p>With Sony rolling out the WH-1000XM6 two years after the introduction of the WH-1000XM5, there's an inevitable price hike; the headset retails for $449, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ">on sale for $398 as of writing</a>; it's a modest 13% decrease, but every little bit makes a difference.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9057d905-c833-4276-a656-feca5112a27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The WH-1000XM6 combines great audio with a durable design and all the extras you need." data-dimension48="The WH-1000XM6 combines great audio with a durable design and all the extras you need." data-dimension25="$398" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1674px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jzoBX8vJNaYL6owGWE2QU5" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jzoBX8vJNaYL6owGWE2QU5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1674" height="1674" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The WH-1000XM6 combines great audio with a durable design and all the extras you need. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9057d905-c833-4276-a656-feca5112a27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The WH-1000XM6 combines great audio with a durable design and all the extras you need." data-dimension48="The WH-1000XM6 combines great audio with a durable design and all the extras you need." data-dimension25="$398">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You travel extensively. The WH-1000XM6 has unmatched noise isolation, and it excels as a travel headset thanks to the new folding hinge design.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a neutral sound. Get the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2 in that case. Also, the WH-1000XM6 doesn't have ingress protection, so that's something to consider.</p><p>I didn't see any problems with the design in the month I tested the WH-1000XM6, and if anything, the headset has better durability than its predecessor. Comfort is good too thanks to the padded ear cushions and headband, and there's decent adjustability. Like its predecessors, the headset doesn't get any ingress protection, so I wouldn't suggest using it at the gym.</p><p>The only issue when it comes to usability is that the WH-1000XM6 has a higher clamping force, and it exerts a noticeable amount of pressure. It gets annoying after a while, and this is one of the main reasons why I didn't take the WH-1000XM6 on a recent intercontinental flight — I prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-one-feature-convinced-me-to-use-the-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-instead-of-sonys-wh-1000xm6">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kaM4p2wjGvkYDaQKvN5aei" name="Sony WH-1000XM6" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kaM4p2wjGvkYDaQKvN5aei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The QC Ultra Gen 2 is much better to wear for an extended duration, and even on a 16-hour flight, I had no issues wearing the headset even if it's 9g heavier — I can't imagine doing that with the WH-1000XM6. Where the WH-1000XM6 comes into its own is noise isolation; Sony does a terrific job with ANC, and that hasn't changed this year. The headset blocks out ambient sounds really well in noisy surroundings, outmatching Bose by a marginal amount.</p><p>When it comes to audio quality, the WH-1000XM6 continues to be a bit bass-heavy, though not as much as its predecessors. The headset has the same 30mm driver as the WH-1000XM5, but changes to the tuning means you get a slightly different sound.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

I still prefer Bose's neutral soundstage, but there's no doubting that the WH-1000XM6 is designed to be lively in this area.</p><p>You can easily customize the sound, adjust EQ, and change modes via the Sony Sound Connect app. It also lets you tweak transparency settings, configure 36-degree sound, and adjust gesture controls. On that note, the headset has intuitive gestures, and it triggers actions without much of a hassle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f8UBsiBgdUAZwVLSnomuTi" name="Sony WH-1000XM6" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f8UBsiBgdUAZwVLSnomuTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sony's LDAC codec is intact on the headset, and you shouldn't have any issues streaming lossless music to the headset with your Android phone — Google worked with Sony to integrate LDAC into Android 8.0 Oreo, and all subsequent versions of the OS have the codec built-in.</p><p>Coming to battery life, the WH-1000XM6 lasted just over the claimed 30 hours, with the headset beating out the QC Ultra Gen 2 by an hour and a half. There's fast charging as well, and you get three hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge, and this definitely came in handy a few times when I didn't charge the headset before going out.</p><p>On the whole, I like what Sony did with the WH-1000XM6. The design is much better this generation, and it's easier to travel with. The sound quality has evolved, you get class-leading noise isolation, and plenty of useful extras. I still prefer the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 as I like the fit better, but if you've used Sony's headsets in the past, you'll love what the WH-1000XM6 has to deliver.

Samsung started a trend with the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's unclear whether it'll follow up that slim device with a Galaxy S26 Edge. There were leaks pointing to an even slimmer device, others suggesting a cancellation, and more recent ones claiming a Galaxy S26 Edge is on the way after all. Due to reportedly weak demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge, this may not sound surprising.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why the Galaxy S25 Edge might not have been the hit Samsung expected. One of them is that the phone is priced the same as other top flagships, like the Google Pixel 10 Pro X<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">L</a>, while offering fewer features. It's natural that those considering a future Galaxy S26 Edge might pivot to a device such as the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>While key details about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge are up in the air, let's see how it might compare to Google's best flagship based on current rumors and leaks.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-and-10-pro-with-boxes" alt="A jade Google Pixel 10 Pro and a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with their respective boxes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26" target="_blank">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> may never be released, but if it does, it'll likely come after the initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">Galaxy S26 launch</a>. This would track with the release schedule of the current Galaxy S25 series. The latest Galaxy S25 Edge didn't debut until May 2025, months after the base, Plus, and Ultra models were made available. While earlier leaks suggested the Galaxy S26 Edge might release earlier, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead">more recent rumors reversed course</a>.</p><p>When or if the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge debuts, it's expected to cost $1,099, just like the current model. It'll be available in 256GB or 512GB storage configurations and multiple color options. As for specifics or a release date, we don't have those yet.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> is widely available as of Aug. 28, 2025.

Samsung is rumored to be taking inspiration from the iPhone's camera plateau. There is said to be a large camera bump on the back of the Galaxy S26 Edge, allowing Samsung to make the main body of the device even thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>However, conflicting reports indicate Samsung is exploring at least two potential prototypes for the Galaxy S26 Edge. One model is claimed to have a 5.5mm thickness, undercutting the current 5.8mm measurement of the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's possible that the variant has been canceled, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">a leak</a>, in favor of a different Galaxy S26 Edge prototype.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead" target="_blank">more recent leak</a> suggests Samsung has a phone in development with the codename "More Slim." This is a clear nod to the "Slim" codename that Samsung originally used for the Galaxy S25 Edge. The interesting part is that, according to the report, "More Slim" entered development later than the original Galaxy S26 Edge prototype.</p><p>So, the Galaxy S26 Edge that eventually releases could end up looking different than the 5.5mm model originally reported.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CvSmH8fHs6YawQjxHNpauU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-01" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of a pond filled with lily pads" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvSmH8fHs6YawQjxHNpauU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, what we do know is that any Galaxy S26 Edge model would have the same 6.7-inch screen size as its predecessor. The underlying display technology will likely remain consistent, too. That means we'll see a 120Hz AMOLED panel with at least 2,600 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a slightly larger 6.8-inch Super AMOLED screen. It's brighter at 3,300 nits, but offers the same 120Hz refresh rate. Like the Galaxy S26 Edge, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a completely flat display covering. Google uses Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>In terms of design, the Pixel 10 Pro XL features flat sides with curved corners and a slight chamfer on the edges. It's significantly thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to be, though. The device measures 8.5mm thick and weighs 232 grams, meaning there could be a difference of three whole millimeters between the two handsets.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to be powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 platform</a> — at least in some regions. There could be a Samsung Exynos variant available, too. This chip builds off the current Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which already runs laps around the Tensor G5 processor in the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>While Google did make strides with the Tensor G5 mobile platform, it lags behind Apple and Qualcomm's best. Gaming performance is improved, but still not great. The one area where Tensor G5 shines is in on-device AI processing and optimization. Plenty of Google AI features run on-device thanks to the Tensor G5 silicon inside the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That's handy for speed and privacy.</p><p>Both phones will likely have the same 16GB of memory available, and will start at 256GB of base storage.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs breakdown</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge (rumored/expected)</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua OLED, 1344 x 2992, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz, 3300 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6µm</p><p>2x optical-quality zoom</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP 123-degree ultrawide with macro focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td><td  ><p>48MP 5x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td><td  ><p>42MP 103-degree Dual PD AF selfie</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v6, NFC, Dual-band GPS, 5G mmWave (NA only), 5G Sub-6, LTE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5200mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, Qi2 magnetic </p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 25W Qi2.2 Pixelsnap wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.7 x 5.5mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8mm x 76.6mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~163g</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Samsung is rumored to bump the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity up to 4,200mAh, but it'll still be about 1,000mAh behind the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Additionally, Google's flagship will charge faster, at 45W over a cable and 25W wirelessly using a Qi2.2 charger. The inbuilt Qi2 magnets help Pixel 10 Pro XL users power up quickly on the go.</p><p>Cameras are another way the Pixel 10 Pro XL makes use of its larger form factor. It includes a 50MP primary shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. On the front, you get a 42MP selfie cam to round out the experience.

It's a sure thing and doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Buyers won't have to worry about short battery life or performance throttling — at least for the first 200 cycles. With Google software at the core and plenty of on-device AI, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will be one of the best Android phones on the market for years to come.</p><p>Unfortunately, those craving the thin-and-light phone lifestyle won't be satisfied by the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It's full of features, but that comes at a cost. It's one of the thickest and heaviest mainline flagships on the market. If the leaked Galaxy S26 Edge specs turn out to be accurate, it would be three millimeters thinner than the Pixel 10 Pro XL. If rumored weights hold, the Galaxy S26 Edge would be nearly 70 grams lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>No matter what your take is on thin phones, there is a major disparity between the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge and Pixel 10 Pro XL. The differences in size are major, and buyers will need to decide whether they're willing to wait and sacrifice features for that form factor.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="56ee66ed-a724-4135-9827-984210a0e5a2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth hoping for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge might be worth hoping for, but not waiting for.

Orange dubs the coming feature "Satellite Message" officially, and states that it will be available for the previously mentioned phones by December 11. For right now, this is for Orange's users based in "mainland France," which brings the ability to "send and receive SMS messages, as well as their location."</p><p>The CEO of Orange France, Jérôme Hénique, states, "'Satellite Message' addresses a critical connectivity need and represents a simple and useful innovation that strengthens service continuity for customers."</p><p>With that in mind, the company states it now leverages its Skylo, a new partnership between it and the NTN (non-terrestrial network) operator. Not only must consumers possess a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> phone, but they must also hold Orange's 5G or 5G Plus subscription. The carrier states this satellite SMS service will reach these Pixel models as a "temporary exclusive" before it rolls it out to more "services and compatible devices."</p><p>While Pixel owners await their date in December, Orange says it will bring its satellite SMS service to "business and enterprise customers" sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="skylo-to-the-stars-2">Skylo to the stars</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-magic-cue-google-messages" alt="A Magic Cue calendar chip in Google Messages on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Skylo sounds familiar, outside of its NTN involvement, it's because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">Google partnered with the company</a> for its Pixel Satellite SOS feature. During its Made by Google event in 2024, Google announced that the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold would leverage Skylo, but only in the continental U.S., excluding Hawaii and Alaska. Skylo's technology makes it possible for Pixel users to remain connected to the world even in remote areas without a cell signal or Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>The other side of Google's Satellite SOS is its emergency service, which Garmin Response takes over. Satellite SOS is available on the Pixel Watch, too, piggybacking off Skylo there, as well.</p><p>Verizon followed in Google's footsteps a few days later last year, partnering with Skylo for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/verizon-skylo-partnership-satellite-based-texting">its own satellite-based texting service</a> (just like Orange). The similarities continue, as Verizon brought its service to "certain smartphones" ahead of larger availability.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But one E Ink alternative you've probably never heard of is making serious headway: RLCD. Short for Reflective Liquid Crystal Display, this technology takes the reflective nature of E Ink and applies it to a more traditional pixel-based display, resulting in substantially smoother performance than E Ink could ever hope to achieve.</p><p>Now, this isn't the first time I've used an RLCD device. I wrote about the Daylight Computer back in June, an Android-based tablet that uses a bespoke black & white RLCD with a backlight. That backlight makes it a rarity among RLCD devices, as the vast majority of them omit the back or frontlight to make them feel as "paperlike" as possible. The only other major RLCD tablet with a frontlight is the upcoming Eazeye Paper 2, scheduled to release in April 2026.</p><p>Today, I'm taking a look at three different RLCD tablets — Harbor Paper 7, Daylight Computer, and Hisense Q5 — to showcase the evolution of RLCD into a true E Ink competitor, from one of the first RLCD tablets ever made to the latest in color RLCD that looks like a screen printed on metal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

The Hisense Q5 was a novel, ill-fated product when it debuted in 2020. Discontinued just weeks after the initial production run, Hisense later made a second batch in 2020, as COVID disrupted supply chains and likely ultimately led to this unique tablet's early demise.</p><p>Up until this product, all LCDs featured transparent layers that allowed a backlight to shine through a layer of colored pixels, creating the images we see on screens. The Hisense Q5 swapped out that transparent layer for a reflective one and removed everything but a black hue, allowing as much light to reflect back to the user as possible.</p><p>This tablet was mind-blowing when it came out, and while the lack of a backlight and a black-and-white display limited its potential, its impact on the display industry was impressively monumental. Years later, companies like Daylight and Eazeye would pick up Hisense's mantle, further developing RLCD with products like the Eazeye Monitor and Daylight Computer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GWA4h5ofon5jkSSJm5hqyk" name="harbor-paper7-daylight-computer-hisense-q5-rlcd-comparison-02" alt="Comparing RLCD tablets' daylight viewability from different angles between the Hisense Q5, Daylight Computer, and Harbor Paper 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWA4h5ofon5jkSSJm5hqyk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those companies took RLCD one step further, creating true 8-bit displays that no longer relied on temporal dithering to fake bit depth, ushering in a new wave of truly flicker-free displays. These are still niche products, but it's clear that RLCD is catching on because it can deliver substantially faster refresh rates and deeper colors than E Ink.</p><p>The best E Ink displays often top out at 40Hz, while RLCD is capable of 120Hz. Similarly, color E Ink displays can typically show 4096 colors, while the 8-bit depth of color RLCDs can show up to 16.8 million colors. Unfortunately, the Harbor Paper 7 color RLCD tablet I have here uses dithering, meaning it can't be considered truly flicker-free.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5WxLXnzyobzX4FpUtGWqim" name="harbor-paper7-daylight-computer-hisense-q5-rlcd-comparison-04" alt="Comparing RLCD tablets' daylight viewability from different angles between the Hisense Q5, Daylight Computer, and Harbor Paper 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5WxLXnzyobzX4FpUtGWqim.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yv77nefqvrcepxAuSNnh8m" name="harbor-paper7-daylight-computer-hisense-q5-rlcd-comparison-05" alt="Comparing RLCD tablets' daylight viewability from different angles between the Hisense Q5, Daylight Computer, and Harbor Paper 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yv77nefqvrcepxAuSNnh8m.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cvPTYcMLrTS38qqYKymZnm" name="harbor-paper7-daylight-computer-hisense-q5-rlcd-comparison-03" alt="Comparing RLCD tablets' daylight viewability from different angles between the Hisense Q5, Daylight Computer, and Harbor Paper 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cvPTYcMLrTS38qqYKymZnm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Of course, nothing is without its limitations. As I covered in my article about the Daylight Computer in June, RLCD requires a constant power source to produce an image. That's because it's still built on a traditional LCD pixel structure, which must provide power to pixels and constantly refresh them.</p><p>E Ink is a completely passive technology that only requires power when the images on the screen are changed. That means that if you're reading something, E Ink requires no power at all to display what's on the screen because the pigments stay there after being "placed." LCDs constantly refresh the screen 60 to 120 times per second, no matter what's going on.</p><h2 id="color-or-black-white-2">Color or black & white?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CDmzr96ttwzPWpzVkGkomF" name="harbor-paper7-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-rlcd-vs-e-ink-holding" alt="Comparing the color output between Kaleido 3 color E Ink on the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen 2 and color RLCD on the Harbor Paper 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDmzr96ttwzPWpzVkGkomF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the world of reflective displays, something strange happens when color is added: the displays dim. It doesn't matter if you're using a built-in frontlight or taking them out in the sunlight, a color RLCD or color E Ink display will always be darker than a black-and-white one. At least, that's the case until someone figures out a novel new way to reflect light off the colored pixels.</p><p>That's because black-and-white displays have only one pigment: black. Color displays must filter light through several colors —  typically red, green, and blue —  before the light is visible to the user again. Because each pixel or pigment is now separated into colored bins, there's less physical space for light to reflect off the display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7Pijrzho8FwNKz6vqB3RSP" name="harbor-paper7-boox-page-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-straight" alt="Comparing color RLCD, color E Ink, and black & white E Ink on a Harbor Paper 7, Onyx Boox Page, and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Pijrzho8FwNKz6vqB3RSP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a similar concept to how camera sensors work, and while a "giant" digital camera will still take better photos than your smartphone could ever hope to. It's hard to beat physics, especially when light is required to create the image you want. Whether it's a display or a camera sensor, a larger area means more light, which inherently results in a better, brighter image.</p><p>It's actually pretty wild to see the difference. Black-and-white E Ink seems to be the brightest of all the technologies, while Daylight Computer's black-and-white RLCD is the runner-up. The Harbor Paper 7 color RLCD is the dimmest display in a crop of five devices I have here, with any Kaleido 3 color E Ink display managing to get just a bit brighter than it. These images are using just reflected sunlight, no back or front light to help illuminate things.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7p62zfpYwGtEnoHQhMzFRP" name="harbor-paper7-boox-page-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-angle" alt="Comparing color RLCD, color E Ink, and black & white E Ink on a Harbor Paper 7, Onyx Boox Page, and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7p62zfpYwGtEnoHQhMzFRP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fPb6cXApduHL3F6wfn7ARP" name="harbor-paper7-boox-page-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-angle-2" alt="Comparing color RLCD, color E Ink, and black & white E Ink on a Harbor Paper 7, Onyx Boox Page, and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPb6cXApduHL3F6wfn7ARP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7gDJYnvvUgS66mrXXm22MP" name="harbor-paper7-boox-page-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-holding" alt="Comparing color RLCD, color E Ink, and black & white E Ink on a Harbor Paper 7, Onyx Boox Page, and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gDJYnvvUgS66mrXXm22MP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Those devices with artificial lights will see improvement in any lighting condition, sometimes even in sunlight. The anti-glare layer on top is also worth considering. Daylight's RLCD and TCL NXTPAPER seem to use a similar anti-reflection layer on their displays, and it results in an inability to see the display at all if held at a specific angle to light glare.</p><p>The Boox E Ink devices I have don't have this issue, and neither does the Harbor Paper 7 color RLCD tablet. I wouldn't call this a debilitating problem for those other two technologies, but you'll need to hold them at a slight angle sometimes, and that may be a big annoyance for some users.</p><p>So, while there's no perfect reflective technology yet, it's clear that several different companies are working to be the first with that title, and that's truly excellent news for everyone focused on eye health over flashy, artificially ultrabright, and flicker-prone display tech like OLED.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's the difference between E Ink and RLCD?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>RLCD uses a traditional pixel structure, meaning the display is made up of potentially millions of tiny pixels that must each be actively powered to display an image. Because of this, RLCD can refresh up to 120Hz, or 120 times per second.</p><p>E Ink displays are made up of millions of tiny magnetically charged white or black pigments. When text is displayed, black pigments are brought to the surface of the display and resemble ink from a pen. Because these displays are magnetically-driven, power is only required to create the initial image and, therefore, E Ink can permanently display an image as long as you'd like after it's been drawn, but refresh rates are currently limited to around 40Hz.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Does E Ink or RLCD have better battery life?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Because E Ink is magnetically-driven, E Ink devices with the same specs will have better battery life than RLCD devices. Commonly, E Ink devices may last weeks on a charge, while RLCD devices may last just days, at best. Devices without an active backlight or frontlight will last longer than those with a light built in when the light is used.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do color E Ink or RLCD e-readers exist?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>This year, we've seen the debut of dozens of new color ePaper devices. Most use E Ink technology, but a few have opted for RLCD. Color E Ink can display around 4096 colors, while color RLCD can display up to 16.8 million colors.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can E Ink or RLCD tablets run Android apps?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Most E Ink and RLCD tablets released in 2025 run Android, which means they generally support all Android apps found on the Google Play Store. Brands like Bigme, Onyx Boox, Harbor, Daylight, and Hannspree are a few examples of Android-powered ePaper tablets that double as e-readers. Amazon Kindles do not run Android apps.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is RLCD good for your eyes?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>RLCD is considered a very eye-friendly alternative to traditional LCD or OLED. Since RLCD is engineered to work without a backlight, it can avoid some of the pitfalls that artificial backlights present, like light flickering or PWM dimming. RLCD, like E Ink, is made to be used with ambient light, and manufacturers often encourage the use of these devices outdoors.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

I've now moved on to the OpenFit 2 Plus earbuds, which means I've spent two straight years wearing them across <em>thousands</em> of miles of running.</p><p>I've switched sporadically to bone conduction earbuds or smart glasses like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>; I'll take <em>any</em> open-ear solution that preserves situational awareness for outdoor runs. But when I needed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">marathon companion</a> for four hours, I wore the OpenFit 2 Plus.</p><p>These earbuds add two key features compared to the OpenFit 2: wireless charging and a Dolby Audio mode. I'll explain whether these perks justify the extra $20, while covering the same excellent perks and lingering complaints from my original OpenFit 2 review.</p><div ><table><caption>Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>PC, silicone</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>9.4g (earbuds); 56g (case)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.4; 2 devices via multipoint pairing; Up to 33 feet</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio profiles and codecs</p></td><td  ><p>A2DP, AVRCP, HFP; SBC, AAC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>11 hours (56mAh); 9 hours with Dolby Audio; Up to 48 hours with case (600mAh)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours in 10 minutes; 100% in 60 minutes; 100 minutes to charge case and earbuds</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Frequency</p></td><td  ><p>50Hz–16Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensitivity</p></td><td  ><p>Woofer: 96.5dB ± 2.5dB; Tweeter: 94.5dB ± 3dB; Microphone: -38 dB ± 1 dB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP55 (earbuds, not case)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="you-don-t-need-dolby-audio-but-you-ll-love-it-2">You don't need Dolby Audio, but you'll love it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hR9wWRq2XsuveRGCnBuLjQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-dolby-audio" alt="The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus workout headphones sitting next to a phone displaying the Shokz app, with the earbuds' battery life, EQ setting, and active Dolby Audio mode visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hR9wWRq2XsuveRGCnBuLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 and 2 Plus are very similar, to the point that if I <em>don't</em> toggle the Dolby Audio setting, they sound identical.</p><p>To quote my original review, the OpenFit 2 series "hits highs and lows in a balanced, rich way" on the Standard setting. I make a point of switching to Vocal for chill audiobook vibes or YouTube playlists while working, or Bass Boost to make R&B tracks a bit punchier outdoors, but you don't <em>need</em> to do this. You get high-quality audio by default across a range of genres.</p><p>Open-ear, bone-conduction earbuds I've tested tend to produce tinny audio at higher frequencies and must be cranked to max volume outdoors for phone calls, vibrating uncomfortably against my ears. With the OpenFit 2 series, my indie music or outdoor chats with family are rich and clear at 50% volume.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mpNHG4eGEG4jjYzU6ezDfQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-kendrick-lamar" alt="Two Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus earbuds sitting atop a Google Pixel 9a, which displays a screenshot of a Kendrick Lamar album that's playing over the earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpNHG4eGEG4jjYzU6ezDfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why I didn't think I <em>needed</em> the OpenFit 2 Plus's Dolby Audio mode. Still, after testing it out, I regret to inform current OpenFit 2 owners that it <em>does</em> upgrade the audio experience in a subtle, pleasurable way, but not enough to spend another $200 for a slight glow-up. For new buyers, though, the extra $20 for Dolby Audio pays for itself in rich, immersive sound.</p><p>The OpenFit 2 Plus' Dolby Audio setting makes songs more resonant, like you're sitting in the middle of a home theater set-up with the sound reverberating off the walls.</p><p>I noted how "luther" by Kendrick Lamar & SZA sounded "rich and harmonious for both the deep and high portions" in my original review; with Dolby Audio activated, though, I catch even more details of the instrumentals behind the track, closer to the level I'd expect from "traditional" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="THwgL95tku5c4Qibr7xahQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-in-ear" alt="A self-photo of the author wearing the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus earbud in his left ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THwgL95tku5c4Qibr7xahQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, Dolby Audio mode makes tracks more distinct and intense at lower volumes. Even outdoors, and with quieter artists like Billie Eilish, I rarely go above 33% of max volume; any higher feels excessive for enjoying the music and is likely to disrupt my situational awareness.</p><p>Dolby Audio is a nice perk, both for audiophiles who want more "traditional" sound quality and for casual users who don't want to fiddle with EQ settings too much. I don't feel the need to use Vocal EQ mode for audiobooks anymore, for example, because Dolby Audio makes the narrator feel like they're sitting in the room next to me.</p><p>That said, if you're looking to save money, you can choose the OpenFit 2s and just be prepared to crank the volume a little higher; you'll still get excellent audio quality compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>.</p><h2 id="wireless-charging-is-a-major-plus-2">Wireless charging is a major plus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xQ6YadFQoqQsWqhugNkr5k" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-wireless-charging" alt="A photo of the closed Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus case sitting atop a Qi charger, with the orange charging indicator visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xQ6YadFQoqQsWqhugNkr5k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other "Plus" upgrade is wireless charging; the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus works with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">Qi-certified wireless chargers</a>. You plop it on a charger, and an orange indicator light will appear. Go about your day, and when the light turns green, take it off, knowing you have 48 hours of workout playlists left.</p><p>This upgrade is superfluous, given you can plug in a USB-C cable at any time and hit 100% power much more quickly. But if you have plenty of Qi chargers in your house, you might be more likely to <em>remember</em> to charge your earbuds when putting them away.</p><p>Shokz didn't give the OpenFit 2 Plus a good way to signal when the case is close to empty. In fact, I've found that when it's at or below 15% power, it won't recharge my earbuds, leaving them at their current charge. When my next workout rolls around, I'm forced to wait to charge them before I can leave, or I don't notice and they die mid-activity.</p><p>This wireless charging perk sidesteps this issue by making it more seamless to top off the charging case. Personally, I wish Shokz had given it a speaker for a low-battery warning and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My</a> functionality instead.</p><h2 id="openfit-2-plus-are-perfect-for-runners-with-one-caveat-2">OpenFit 2 Plus are perfect for runners, with one caveat</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eQDDxfnopw76EGTbNUPpkQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-ear-hook" alt="A self-photo of the author wearing a Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus earbud on his left ear, angled to show the hook behind his ear fitting next to his glasses arm." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQDDxfnopw76EGTbNUPpkQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="JCG28fCmZphzBkFzkXu7RN" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-speaker-grill-close-up" alt="A close-up of a single Shokz OpenFit 2+ earbud, focused on the speaker grill on the bottom that angles into your ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JCG28fCmZphzBkFzkXu7RN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1754" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What makes the OpenFit 2 Plus work is the thin, comfortable ear hook that secures it in place and angles the speakers directly into your canal. They've never fallen off across hundreds of hours of use, even when wearing glasses, and while they're a bit distracting when sitting at a desk, you'll forget about them when working out or walking about doing chores.</p><p>The directional audio ensures there's minimal audio bleed, even with Dolby Audio. People <em>right</em> next to you indoors can hear the hint of the beat and melody, but not the lyrics, and ambient noise outdoors ensures no one will catch anything.</p><p>It goes without saying that you won't get any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/tech-talk-what-is-anc-and-how-does-it-work">ANC</a>, and some athletes will prefer an option that can switch between noise passthrough and cancellation with a tap.  I prefer workout earbuds that don't have to be shoved uncomfortably deep into my ears so that they won't fall out mid-run.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="H75GbVAEMvbg9XQaiTUNXQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-close-up" alt="Two Shokz OpenFit 2+ earbuds sitting on a wooden shelf, one upright and one flat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H75GbVAEMvbg9XQaiTUNXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The original OpenFits had obnoxious touchpad controls that rarely worked as intended and often caused accidental music pausing or phone hang-ups. Shokz wisely added a physical button this generation, making it easy to double-press to your next track or long-press to increase or decrease the volume without breaking stride.</p><p>Shokz also increased the battery life by four hours to 11 total, though Dolby Audio cuts that boost in half. I rarely use the OpenFit 2 Plus that long, but on my marathon day, I started wearing them at 5:30 a.m., streamed music (with Dolby Audio enabled) for 4+ hours, wore them to the airport, had an hour of phone calls with family, and then watched a two-hour movie on my flight. By 6 p.m., my earbuds were at 20%; I hadn't used them the entire time, but their standby battery life is excellent, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NjxonZTFSKD3Yuv7vN6haQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-workout-headphones-and-case" alt="A close-up photo of the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus earbuds and case, one earbud sitting inside and the other beside the case.

That makes me confident wearing them for long runs, but brings me to my one warning: don't put these earbuds directly into the case after a workout if they're wet or sweat-covered.</p><p>The case's magnetic pins can also pick up dirt and grime from the earbuds, preventing proper charging and keeping the earbuds connected to your phone even after you close the case. This was more of a problem with the original OpenFits, but the issue has unfortunately persisted this generation, to a lesser extent.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-shokz-openfit-2-plus-2">Should you buy the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DGsLBpc8r7YpBiCcfkFbJQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-versus-OpenFit-2" alt="The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus (left) and OpenFit 2 (right) cases sitting open and angled so the charging earbuds are visible.

But I think they're <em>mostly</em> right for workouts, and if you need noise cancellation or a more subtle in-ear design, they won't be the right fit.</p><p>But I wasn't lying when I said I've been wearing Shokz OpenFits for years, and as long as I keep cleaning them after workouts to prevent any internal damage, I fully intend to keep wearing them for my future training and races. They keep me motivated while still allowing me to stay safe and prevent collisions with other athletes.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3fd4ac98-2683-4ab3-8325-4854b37385e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj8keyq5rW7qcvXmjNbzM6.png' alt="Render of the black Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus wireless earbuds and case"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Shokz</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">OpenFit 2 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Plus a little razzle dazzle</strong></em></p><p>The OpenFit 2 Plus take a winning formula and make it better with useful additions like wireless charging and Dolby Audio, making these greta for runners.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shokz-openfit-2-plus-faqs"><span>Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus FAQs</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hqpdCdoQAvKFBDsB39PxXQ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-Plus-versus-OpenFit-2-cases" alt="A closed silver Shokz OpenFit 2+ case (left) next to a closed white Shokz OpenFit 2 case (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hqpdCdoQAvKFBDsB39PxXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's different between the OpenFit 2 Plus, 2, and Air?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus are nearly identical to the OpenFit 2, except with the Dolby Audio toggle available in the Shokz app. The charging case has the same capacity but incorporates Qi wireless charging.

Click either button once to play or pause music, answer a call, or end a call. Hold the left or right button to decrease or increase audio volume. Double-click either button for the next track, or triple-click either button for the previous track; you can also customize these options. Each earbud also has a touchpad on the back, which lets you enable a long-press shortcut to activate your voice assistant.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

It's also got a long-lasting battery, and easy compatibility with other devices within the Samsung ecosystem. Additionally, it comes with the Windows 11 Home OS, the Copilot AI assistant, and a built-in voice assistant with Bixby. It's also compatible with other voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Cortana, and more.

The Galaxy Book 4 may be last-gen, but this one still boasts a large display, plenty of storage and memory for most, and a front-facing camera for basic video calls.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-book4-15-6-fhd-laptop-intel-core-7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-silver/J3ZYG2TPS5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$899.99" data-dimension48="$899.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a laptop that's larger than average but still offers enough battery life to make it through the work day; you like having a laptop with a sleek, minimal design; you've liked other devices within the Samsung ecosystem and you want something similar and powerful.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a 2-in-1 laptop with a touchscreen and the ability to fold it into more of a tablet; you'd rather upgrade to a newer generation device, and maybe to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">best Samsung laptops </a>available today; you're not looking for a mid-level or premium laptop, and you'd rather get a computer for under $500; you prefer a lightweight laptop.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Book laptop series has been well-liked since its inception, and the Galaxy Book 4 is no exception to the rule. This particular version of the laptop comes with the huge, 15.6-inch Full HD LED display and a 60Hz refresh rate, sporting up to 300 nits of brightness. It also comes with 512GB of SSD storage, which is plenty for most.</p><p>Meanwhile, the laptop's performance is backed by 16GB of RAM for optimal multi-tasking capabilities, as well as a 10-core Intel Core 7 Series 1 CPU that features boost clock speeds of up to 5.4 GHz.</p><p>As for connectivity, the Galaxy Book 4 features two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, a headphone and mic jack, an HDMI output and an ethernet port. The laptop also comes with a 45W USB-C power supply, a backlit keyboard, a 720p selfie cam, and a built-in set of stereo speakers.</p><p>It is worth noting that this isn't a particularly lightweight laptop at almost 3.5 pounds, but if that doesn't bother you or stop it from being portable enough for you, then this price point might be right.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-42">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><u><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><u><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><u><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><u><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></u></a>  <br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><u><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><u><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><u><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As seen on the video below, a new “Find Your Phone” button sits next to the USB-C port, and pressing it will ping your connected device as long as it’s within Bluetooth range.</p><p>Additionally, the case is said to include a built-in speaker grille, suggesting that Samsung also wants the case to make noise so you can locate it when it inevitably ends up between sofa cushions.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDp1SbBdJJY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>These findings were all spotted in early One UI 8.5 firmware, which has quietly revealed several upcoming features and design changes. More recently, it was discovered that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-leak-shows-a-major-redesign-and-wild-new-feature">the Buds 4 Pro themselves could look noticeably different from the Buds 3 Pro</a>, trading the sharp, blade-like stems for flatter lines and a brushed-metal finish.</p><h2 id="case-layout-changed-2">Case layout changed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-4-Pro-new-design" alt="new design and stem appearance of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="547" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case is supposedly getting a redesign too, with the earbuds now sitting flat instead of upright. Leaked images show black and white versions, though Samsung rarely stops at two colors, so expect more options later down the road.</p><p>Those firmware strings also point to head-gesture controls, which could let you answer calls or silence alarms with a simple nod or shake.</p><p>As we often mention as a disclaimer, nothing is official yet, but all signs point to a reveal alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup early next year. That timing tracks with Samsung’s typical hardware cadence, and it gives the Buds 4 Pro room to launch as a headlining accessory.</p><p>If Samsung sticks the landing, the Buds 4 Pro could easily become one of the standout <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">premium earbuds</a> of the cycle, especially for users who care about smart integration as much as sound quality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While my favorite is Walkabout Mini Golf, the platform has plenty of options, from other fun mini golf games to titles like Golf+ which put you on real PGA fairways so you can golf even when the weather in real life kinda sucks.</p><p>But VR golf has always been missing one thing, until today: tactile feedback. Sure, the controller vibrates when you hit a ball, but that doesn't feel like the real thing. A new putter from popular accessories maker AMVR solves that problem in an expected way.</p><p>Inside the club shaft is a two-piece mechanism that moves when you swing the club, creating a satisfying thwack the moment the ball comes into contact with the club. The ball, of course, is virtual and therefore imaginary, but the feeling of hitting the ball still remains.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBNeWLEMxJc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>I particularly admire that AMVR was able to create a tension component to the mechanism that can be easily adjusted via a dial on the end of the grip. Turn it left to decrease the force necessary to activate the mechanism inside, or crank it all the way right if you tend to swing with a lot of force. This still won't make it work for mini golf, but it's a great way to adjust for players of differing strength levels and heights.</p><p>I've been using this club for about two weeks now and can attest to it's convincing nature. The only problem for me, at least, is that it *only* works consistently when making a full swing. Mini golf swings and putts simply don't provide enough force to trigger the mechanism inside. AMVR tells me a future version could change this but, for now, this club is best suited to VR golf fans who hit long drives.</p><p>Some players might also find the club a little too long for comfort. There's no height adjustment for this one, and it's noticeably longer than any other VR golf club accessory I've got.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VC2pXpHbbEeQyKZS7GdaRe" name="amvr-golf-clubs-haptic-club-controller-mount" alt="How the controller mounts to the AMVR haptic golf club accessory for Meta Quest 3 and 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VC2pXpHbbEeQyKZS7GdaRe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QuX9X5zHffbedMxSoHYMRe" name="amvr-golf-clubs-haptic-club-force-adjustment" alt="How to adjust the force needed to activate the mechanism in the AMVR haptic golf club accessory for Meta Quest 3 and 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QuX9X5zHffbedMxSoHYMRe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Quest 3 or Quest 3S controller fits snuggly in the cradle at the end of the club, held in place by a rubber latch that firmly clicks in place. You can also loop the wrist strap around the shaft, creating a knot that'll keep it from flying if you didn't attach the rubber latch tightly enough.</p><p>Despite using around a dozen different VR golf accessories in the last decade, I've never used one that provides tactile feedback like this AMVR club does. You can even add an extra weight to the end to make it feel like a heavier club, something that'll help golf enthusiasts with as they practice their swings.</p><p>I recommend pairing it with an open facial interface (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Open-Facial-Interface-Visibility/dp/B09MJQW8HC/">Quest 3 version</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Interface-Replacement-Accessories-Installation-Experience/dp/B0DRRVHGCJ/?th=1">Quest 3S version</a>) when you play, though, as the long club can very easily smack into something if you're too close to furniture, walls, or something else. Big thumbs up to AMVR for great innovation on this one, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else the company puts together using this novel new concept!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="dca43ca8-da79-40fc-9e90-9e3cccecd794">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-GA1-Feedback-Attachment-Compatible/dp/B0FMXGWV4X/" data-model-name="Haptic golf club" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:103.45%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zm2dP5Sorhguf2SutHnrr3.jpg' alt="An official render of the AMVR haptic golf club accessory for the Meta Quest 3/3S"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>AMVR</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Haptic golf club</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Weather got you down because you can't golf?

And now the streaming giant is trying to woo its lost subscribers with a promo. The new deal brings back all the channels, including ESPN, ABC, and more, to the streaming platform.</p><p>This 15-day blackout created unnecessary disruptions for subscribers who were caught in the middle of these streaming giants. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-easily-claim-your-usd20-youtube-tv-credit-amid-disney-blackout">YouTube TV did issue credits </a>to its users for the inconvenience caused.</p><p>But the timing of it all was particularly disruptive for sports fans, who missed major live sports programming on ESPN and ABC, including college football matchups, NBA, and NFL games.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1ozxr3h/60_promo_to_return">$60 Promo to Return</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>This, in turn, caused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-and-disney-may-be-at-war-but-fans-caught-in-the-crossfire">several subscribers to ditch</a> the platform to look for other means to watch these sports events. According to several reports, a significant percentage of YouTube TV's estimated 10 million subscribers either cancelled or considered cancelling their service during the blackout.</p><p>The subscribers who left the service started getting emails from YouTube TV asking them to return for $60 off the first month, according to a user on Reddit (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/18/youtube-tv-offers-select-users-60-off-return/">9to5 Google</a>).</p><p>With the base plan costing $82.99, this discount slashed the first month's cost to just $22.99, a huge incentive for people who come back. Several people on the Reddit thread confirm getting these emails, but a few users who canceled their subscriptions haven't seen them yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Y3i3TJmkwn5sccKAHkvKmP" name="youtube-tv-logo-androiddtv-p91l.jpg" alt="YouTube TV app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:249,l:0,cw:2048,ch:1152,q:80/Y3i3TJmkwn5sccKAHkvKmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This move only goes to show that YouTube TV is clearly prioritizing the recovery of lost subscribers, as evidenced by this "win-back" approach—one of the streaming industry's most aggressive tactics.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tvs-espn-unlimited-win-has-one-major-catch-for-baseball-fans">other news</a>, YouTube TV’s lower-cost sports bundle is possibly coming next year; however, MLB.TV, a crucial sports add-on for cord-cutters, will not be in the new bundle.</p><p>Major League Baseball made a separate deal to move MLB.TV into the ESPN app starting in 2026, consolidating its out-of-market games under ESPN's direct-to-consumer platform instead of third parties like YouTube TV. This means YouTube TV, despite carrying more ESPN content, will not offer MLB.TV.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Nothing's flagship lineup is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones">Nothing Phone 3 series</a>, and it now includes four different models spanning all price points. The top-of-the-line Phone 3 retails for $799, while the cheapest Phone 3a Lite goes for roughly $329.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Lite, Phone 3a, Phone 3a Pro, and Phone 3 all have a lot in common — especially among the three cheapest models. U.S. availability for the lineup is sparse. The Phone 3a Lite isn't available in the region at all, while the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro are only available through a beta program with limited cellular carrier support. Only the flagship Nothing Phone 3 is built for true North American use.</p><p>Still, the Nothing Phone 3 lineup is highly sought after in Europe, India, and the rest of the world. Even for North American buyers, there's nothing quite like Nothing design. If you're intrigued by the company's 2025 lineup, this guide will help you figure out which Nothing Phone 3 variant you should buy.</p><h2 class="article-body__section"

newest and most interesting device in the Nothing Phone 3 lineup. It's an extremely cut-down version of the Phone 3a that tries to be more affordable, but there's more to it than that. If you look at the specs, the Phone 3a Lite is effectively a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a> in a Nothing-inspired shell with tweaked hardware. It's priced at €249, and for now, it's exclusive to the U.K. and Europe.</p><p>The Phone 3a Lite looks more like the flagship Phone 3 than either of the two mid-tier variants, which have a centrally-positioned camera bump. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Lite's three rear cameras are a bit scattered around the top-left corner, much like the Phone 3. The camera system is highlighted by a 50MP primary shooter, but the 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro lenses aren't much to speak of.</p><p>It has a solid 6.77-inch OLED screen supporting 120Hz refresh rates — the same panel you'll find on the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro. With a 3,000-nit peak brightness rating, the Phone 3a Lite's display will look better than you'd expect for the price.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The catch is the Mediatek Dimensity 7300 Pro processor, which means the Phone 3a Lite simply won't perform as well as the other Phone 3a models. It comes with Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15 out of the box, with three major Android OS upgrades to follow. A pretty large 5,000mAh battery rounds out the hardware experience.</p><p>If you're interested in this phone, you should know that Nothing really put the "lite" in the Phone 3a Lite. There are a lot of cut corners here, and some features — like the 2MP macro lens — won't lead to tangible benefits beyond the spec sheet. Unless you're on a tight budget, it probably makes sense to look at the Phone 3a, Phone 3a Pro, and Phone 3.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0df2726c-1310-4f22-b63c-a80a90fac543">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whAhqxzE7zznMLx2LbJ896.jpg' alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3a Lite</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The budget buy</strong></em></p><p>If you're in Europe and need a cheap Android phone with some flair, the Nothing Phone 3a Lite is a decent option.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3a-the-budget-option"><span>Nothing Phone 3a: The budget option</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-3" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Phone 3a is the first entry-level model most users should actually consider. It's available for U.S. customers by way of the beta program, and there's also a version available in India. The smartphone retails for $379 / £329 / €329 / ₹24,999, and comes in Black, White, or Blue (U.K./India exclusive) colorways.</p><p>Of the four Phone 3 devices, I find the Phone 3a's design to be the most attractive. It features Nothing's classic transparent design with an oval-shaped rear camera bump. There are multicolor accents throughout the chassis and Nothing's iconic Glyph Interface. On the Phone 3a, it includes three individual LED strips that can be used to signal notifications, calls, timers, and more. The body has an IP64 certification for dust-resistance and light water-resistance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q7hJEMw3bPiF6ncGYPRdWa" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-4" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q7hJEMw3bPiF6ncGYPRdWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is the same 6.77-inch panel you'll find on the Phone 3a Lite and Phone 3a Pro. It'll default to 1,300 nits in high brightness mode, with a 3,000-nit peak. The screen also supports 120Hz refresh rates and DC dimming above 50% brightness for eye-friendliness.</p><p>For power, there's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor. The chip is paired with 8GB and 12GB of RAM to handle daily performance and light AI processing or gaming. Like the other midrange Nothing phones, the Phone 3a ships with the Android 15-based Nothing OS 3.1 out of the box, with three future Android OS upgrades guaranteed.</p><p>Whether you pick the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro</a> will likely come down to what camera quality you need.

It's available in Grey and Black, and the 256GB/12GB variant retails for £449 / $459 / €459 / ₹33,999.</p><p>Starting with the similarities, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> has the exact same 6.77-inch display as the Phone 3a. The size, refresh rate, resolution, and peak brightness rating are all identical between models. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip is the same, too. A key difference is that, outside of two India-exclusive models, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro ships with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM as standard everywhere else.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro home page with custom icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead of an oval-shaped camera bump, it's a giant circle on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Users still get the Glyph Interface on the back, and the LEDs work with Nothing OS 3.1 to show notifications and more as expected. The difference is what's behind the camera bump. Despite having two 50MP rear cameras and a third 8MP rear camera, just like the Phone 3a, the Phone 3a Pro's sensors are a bit different.</p><p>The main camera is a 50MP, f/1.88 Samsung shooter, and it's accompanied by a 50MP periscope telephoto lens. That gives Phone 3a Pro users up to 3x optical zoom, up from just 2x on the Phone 3a. The ultrawide lenses are the same across models, so the Phone 3a Pro is the upgrade for people who really need extra zoom length.</p><p>At $459, the Phone 3a Pro is priced just below the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, making it competitive with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget Android phones</a>. Still, the U.S. beta-only access will leave some AT&T and Verizon users without service, so it's a hard sell for North American buyers.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e3169c5f-66d9-4ff7-b0d7-1704014b7296">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gsBS2JyY2XVUUxASp2XZYB.jpg' alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The midrange buy</strong></em></p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is a Phone 3a with a more premium design and a better telephoto camera, sitting underneath the flagship Phone 3.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-the-flagship"><span>Nothing Phone 3: The flagship</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Kd3ksMS4BkwYUxqDQFSZeR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kd3ksMS4BkwYUxqDQFSZeR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the flagship option, and it's the only model in this lineup officially sold in the U.S. — and officially supported by all the nation's cellular carriers. It's priced like a flagship, at $799, but the features are still in midrange territory. Nothing shook things up with the Phone 3, ditching the iconic Glyph Interface for a new Glyph Matrix, but this dot-matrix display seems on its way to being just as iconic.</p><p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chip, the Phone 3 is the fastest performer of the series, although it'll still be a step behind Elite-branded SoCs. It ships with either 12GB or 16GB of memory and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. It offers 5,150mAh of battery capacity with 65W fast charging, which, to Nothing's credit, is firmly in flagship territory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fhKVjsRUXErAvpzZ8EJLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone's design won't be for everyone, with Nothing's classic transparent design and asymmetrical rear camera lens placement. The entire rear chassis looks scattered, but in a way, that becomes a statement piece of its own. On the front, there's a flat 6.67-inch AMOLED display covered in Gorilla Glass 7i for protection.</p><p>The Phone 3's cameras are extremely solid, packing a trio of 50MP sensors. The primary shooter is a 50MP, f/1.7 lens, and it's paired with a 50MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and a 50MP ultrawide. Our review found that it's the best camera system Nothing has ever shipped, taking clear shots with little visible noise.</p><p>Those wanting to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>, or any Nothing phone for that matter, will do so because of the phone's design and flair. It doesn't offer the best hardware or the most enticing value proposition, but its looks and features are unique. The dot-matrix secondary display on the back is one of the coolest things I've seen on a phone — you can put almost anything on it. With all that in mind, the Phone 3 is Nothing's flagship for a reason.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1ffe74b8-51b1-4e27-bfdf-ed3cbf84655c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Flagship for a reason</strong></em></p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 sports the best chip in the lineup and a next-generation Glyph Matrix interface on the back.

It appears that while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disneys-channels-return-to-youtube-tv-after-intense-negotiations">YouTube TV and Disney were ironing out their deal</a>, Major League Baseball made a separate plan to move MLB.TV into the ESPN app starting in 2026.</p><p>That move lets MLB consolidate its out-of-market games under ESPN’s direct-to-consumer umbrella, rather than relying on third-party distributors like YouTube TV. So, even though YouTube TV now carries more ESPN content, it doesn’t gain access to MLB.TV.</p><p>This is a real setback for people who use YouTube TV to watch out-of-market baseball. MLB.TV has been an important part of sports streaming, and many subscribers thought that adding more ESPN channels to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> would also bring MLB’s package.</p><h2 id="a-deliberate-power-play-2">A deliberate power play?</h2><p>Instead, YouTube TV gets the broader ESPN catalog, but the one piece baseball fans wanted most is now being tucked away behind ESPN’s own app. The technical reason is pretty simple: MLB’s new rights structure gives ESPN the keys to out-of-market streaming, letting the league manage distribution, pricing, and bundling more directly.</p><p>The bigger picture is that sports streaming is getting even more fragmented. A single subscription rarely covers everything anymore, and even highly publicized carriage deals come with fine print that can reshape what you actually get.</p><p>The next step is watching how MLB prices the new setup inside the ESPN app and whether it stays a standalone add-on or becomes part of a larger bundle.</p><p>Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether YouTube TV pursues a separate agreement for MLB.TV or leave the baseball die-hards to subscribe elsewhere. Either way, subscribers looking for complete MLB coverage will soon need more than just YouTube TV, no matter how many ESPN channels the service adds.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Need an alternative to YouTube TV?</strong></em><br><a href="https://www.hulu.com/start/affiliate-livetv"><strong>Hulu + Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus: $89.99/month with free trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The publication cites an alleged insider who claimed, "Exynos 2600 is reportedly showing strong numbers in benchmark tests, but the performance it delivers when actually installed and running in a smartphone is a completely different matter."</p><p>This has reportedly become so much of an issue that people are beginning to worry about the chance for "performance discrepancies" between Galaxy S26 devices with the Exynos 2600 and those with the next Qualcomm Snapdragon.</p><h2 id="concerned-or-confident-2">Concerned or confident?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4bssY3WGBM89e24mAu539M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-5" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bssY3WGBM89e24mAu539M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The performance of the Exynos 2600 continues to be a real brain teaser for people, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">takes us back to previous rumors</a>. A report from mid-October claims that the Exynos 2600 could surprise consumers by making the Galaxy S26 a real snappy device. The chip has allegedly received upgrades to bring it into contention with Apple and Qualcomm, as it appears "faster" and "graphically stronger" than its competitors, per those October rumors.</p><p>Fast-forward to mid-November, and we're seeing some varying sentiments, as analysts are reportedly concerned about its real-world application on the Galaxy S26.</p><p>Those rumors from October held speculations that the Exynos 2600 was ~75% graphically and potentially ~14% better in multi-core performance over Apple's A19 Pro. The true performance of the chip (and phones) will be revealed in 2026, so we'll have to settle for these accusations for the time being.</p><p>Also, like Samsung's previous Exynos behavior, every region <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">might not see the 2600 chip</a>. It seems that consumers in Europe and potentially South Korea may see it, leaving Qualcomm to the U.S. and others. As always, take things with a pinch of salt. The Galaxy S26 has been rumored to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">see a slightly later debut</a> in February 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-10s-pro-review">reviewed the Redmagic 10S Pro</a> just six months ago, and the brand is now detailing its latest flagship, the Redmagic 11 Pro.</p><p>Redmagic didn't change too much with the design of the phone, but there's a novel new addition: liquid cooling. The Redmagic 11 Pro has the distinction of being the only phone to use liquid cooling, and it also retains the dedicated cooling fan. The battery is even bigger now at 7,500mAh, outmatching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">OnePlus 15</a> — this is the biggest battery you can get in a phone in North America.</p><p>Basically, what you have here is a giant slab of a gaming phone with a ridiculous battery. The best part is that it doesn't cost anywhere as much as a regular flagship, even though you're getting the latest Qualcomm silicon and all the other extras.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-11-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>Redmagic 11 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nhHsV9FmWX3t9xS2JpXBWB" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nhHsV9FmWX3t9xS2JpXBWB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Redmagic unveiled the 11 Pro on November 3, and the phone is going on sale starting November 19 in all markets where the brand has a presence. The base variant of the phone comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs $699/£629/€699, which is a pretty great value when you consider the caliber of hardware you're getting.</p><p>There's also a 16GB/512GB edition that costs $799/£709/€799, and a 24TB/1TB model retailing at $999/£879/€999 if you want to go all-out. I'm using the 16GB/512GB model in the Subzero color option, and I think this model does a great job highlighting the design and liquid cooling.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 11 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED, 2688x1216, 2,000 nits max, Gorilla Glass 7i</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Redmagic OS 11 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, Adreno 840, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB/24GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.9, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IPX8 water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, Snapdragon Sound, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,500mAh silicon battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.8 x 76.5 x 8.9mm, 230g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Subzero, Nightfreeze, Cryo</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-11-pro-design"><span>Redmagic 11 Pro: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pCV4dQYQbcaUdUDDTeJiKB" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCV4dQYQbcaUdUDDTeJiKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not going to talk too much about the design, as the Redmagic 11 Pro is nearly identical to its predecessor.

Of course, the styling is unlike any other phone today, and the LED lighting along with visible screws and brushed metal aesthetic underneath the glass make the phone stand out quite a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ipe8muVXbd6UB69Q7EuqHB" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipe8muVXbd6UB69Q7EuqHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also like that the visual nature of the liquid cooling system; you can see the fluid move around when it's engaged, and it's very cool. In a similar vein, you can tell when the built-in fan is active, and it gets LED lighting as well. This is a phone that demands (and gets) instant attention, and I like that Redmagic has its own visual identity now — that wasn't the case in the past.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2NruRj5sBKVBiTFaJQ3e5B" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NruRj5sBKVBiTFaJQ3e5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Redmagic sells the phone in three colors: Cryo, Nightfreeze, and Subzero.

The rear pane of glass on my 10S Pro broke without much effort — it just slid down the couch and landed on the floor — so it's a good thing that Redmagic bundles a case with the phone. Now, while it is a disservice to cover up that design, I'd suggest doing so as the glass doesn't really handle tumbles well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gKJhdhjv3jQ3isCiEcQL3B" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gKJhdhjv3jQ3isCiEcQL3B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4980" height="2805" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, the only notable change is that the fingerprint module is in a decent location, and the phone gets IPX8 water resistance.

Having tested the chipset, I found it to be faster than the Dimensity 9500, but at the cost of overheating. While it isn't as evident in daily use, extended gaming sessions make the phone quite toasty, and I even had instances where I was doing 3DMark stress testing where the phone basically shut down.</p><p>Thankfully, it isn't as big an issue in general gaming scenarios. This is where Redmagic's unique cooling solution is handy; the 11 Pro gets a piezoelectric ceramic micropump that circulates coolant into "ultra-fine liquid channels" at the back, and it has a high threshold, working anywhere between -40 to 70 degrees Celsius. Combined with the built-in fan and dedicated vapor chamber, the Redmagic 11 Pro has the most extensive cooling solution of any phone available today.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 11 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X300 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3614</p></td><td  ><p>3133</p></td><td  ><p>3391</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>10785</p></td><td  ><p>9479</p></td><td  ><p>10085</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7105</p></td><td  ><p>6954</p></td><td  ><p>6546</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>42.55</p></td><td  ><p>41.64</p></td><td  ><p>39.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>13449</p></td><td  ><p>12379</p></td><td  ><p>13588</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>51.14</p></td><td  ><p>47.07</p></td><td  ><p>51.67</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It needs that to handle the heat generated by the Qualcomm silicon, and to Redmagic's credit, there isn't much in the way of throttling even with extended gaming. The downside is that the phone gets a bit hot, but it is manageable, and it doesn't heat up anywhere as much as its immediate rivals that use the same silicon.</p><p>Other niceties include a gaming mode that lets customize trigger actions and tweak the settings.

The bigger battery is great to see as well, and thankfully, Redmagic didn't mess with the software — you still get a clean UI with good optimization.</p><p>Ultimately, the 11 Pro is all about hardware prowess; the cameras aren't that great, and Redmagic doesn't try to hide that fact. So if you need a powerful gaming phone with average cameras, this is without a doubt the best choice. There's no arguing the value, and at $699, you're paying considerably less than all other flagships while still getting the latest internals, and that in itself is a win.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5bbd1ca8-8eae-4e7b-a031-8dbb90a30f73">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png' alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Redmagic 11 Pro </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Redmagic 11 Pro is an unbeatable value if you want a high-end gaming phone with all the extras.

But if you skipped all the menus during onboarding, I can point you to where to find the Gemini Raise to Talk toggle.</p><p>More importantly, if you've enabled Gemini Raise to Talk but find it's not as responsive as you'd like — or if you're getting false-positive activations — I'll show you where to change your settings to match your preferences.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-and-customize-gemini-raise-to-talk-on-your-google-pixel-watch-4-2">How to set up and customize Gemini Raise to Talk on your Google Pixel Watch 4</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VVPvJwLYwFtsNoGk2nSTaj" name="Gemini-Raise-To-Talk-setup" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting atop a Google Pixel 9a smartphone on a shelf, the watch showing "Continue on phone" and the phone showing "Turn on Raise to talk to speak directly to Gemini," with a "Turn on" button visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VVPvJwLYwFtsNoGk2nSTaj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Raise to Talk is only available on the Pixel Watch 4; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and earlier models can only use "Hey Google" or the Side button shortcut.</p><p>During the initial Pixel Watch 4 setup, after you've signed in to your Google account, make sure to select <strong>Set up more</strong> on the optional "Your watch is ready for more" screen, then <strong>Set up</strong> on the "Talk to your assistant" screen.

With lower sensitivity, however, you need to move your arm <em>decisively</em> to your face, then speak loudly and quickly, just to get Gemini's attention.</p><p>I prefer higher sensitivity with the occasional accidental activation to having Gemini ignore me, forcing me to make the upward gesture again. But it comes down to your preferences.</p><p>Ultimately, having quicker access to Gemini via Raise to Talk is great.

Boasberg states, "The Court ultimately concludes that the agency has not carried its burden: Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market." There is one interesting aspect to note about this federal ruling, and that concerns TikTok. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, previously stated that the platform was in "fierce competition" with TikTok to "attract users under 30."</p><p>Even Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, argued that Facebook serves a "different role in the social media space," as do Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, stated that the company did not acquire the latter in order to "neutralize" or control that particular market space, but rather to "improve and grow" them.</p><p>With this in mind, and with the inclusion of Meta seeking to better compete with TikTok in the social media space, it's been reported that Judge James Boasberg rejected the FTC's claim that TikTok falls within the entertainment category, not social media. The post claims Boasberg made this decision based on evidence that Instagram and WhatsApp "benefited" from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">TikTok's brief blackout in the U.S.</a> earlier in 2025.</p><p>Boasberg adds, "Like Heraclitus’s river, the rapids of social media rush along so fast that the Court has never even stepped into the same case twice. ... Each time it examined Meta’s apps, they had changed. The competitors had, too."</p><h2 id="no-harm-no-foul-2">No harm, no foul</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="8ZKDJUHPgucMghz5HGKrQZ" name="Instagram-logo.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a smartphone lying flat on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ZKDJUHPgucMghz5HGKrQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TikTok was in some hot water with the U.S. Government earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">dodging a full ban for the second time</a> in April. The Beijing-based company was publicly against divesting any portion of TikTok to the U.S., with it stating it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">would rather hop out of the country entirely</a>, rather than see any part given away. However, TikTok and the U.S. government have been in talks since April about a potential divestiture agreement, which would have to see approval from the Chinese government, too.</p><p>At the time, ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) stated, "an agreement has not been executed" and that "there are key matters to be resolved." The Trump Administration has said that it "does not want TikTok to go dark."</p><p>It was during this time in April, and earlier this year in January, when TikTok actually disappeared for a while, that Judge James Boasberg cited in his ruling. Moreover, Boasberg mentioned a similar scenario in India from 2020, when it banned TikTok. The judge stated that users viewed the apps as involved as "similar apps," thus facilitating its rejection of the FTC's claims in favor of Meta.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When Extreme Battery Saver is enabled, Google claims each three phones is capable of lasting for up to 100 hours on a single charge. In terms of the actual battery sizes, the Pixel 10 features a 4,970mAh battery, the Pixel 10 Pro comes with a 4,870mAh cell, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL is equipped with a 5,200mAh battery.</p></article></section><h2 id="what-to-know-about-the-google-pixel-10-battery-life-2">What to know about the Google Pixel 10 battery life</h2><p>On the bright side, all three Pixel 10 models feature larger batteries than the trio of phones they are replacing. And while the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> saw the biggest upgrade in battery size, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is actually the phone that manages to impress.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">our review</a>, Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich found that "the Pixel 10 Pro XL lasts around 90 minutes longer per charge than the Pixel 9 Pro XL." Meanwhile, the smaller Pixel 10 Pro is said to only offer "meager improvements," as it lasts for "at best — 20 minutes or so longer than the Pixel 9 Pro."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As is the case with any phone, you might not notice these kinds of results immediately, with the battery draining fairly quickly. However, this is normal, as you have to go through the initial setup process, which includes downloading all of your apps and signing into them. Then, the phones will learn how they are being used in order to provide an optimized experience.</p><p>When it comes to charging, sadly, there's not much to really write home about when it comes to wired charging. The Pixel 10 and 10 Pro are limited to 25W wired charging speeds, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL topping out around 40W.</p><p>According to Google, both the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro will gain "up to 55% in 30 minutes," provided that you are using a 30W USB-C PPS charger (or higher). With the Pixel 10 Pro XL, that number jumps up a bit, as it can reach about 70% in 30 minutes, but you'll need at least a 45W USB-C PPS charger.</p><p>As for wireless charging, it's much of the same, with a bit of a twist. All three models are equipped with Google's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Pixelsnap</a> magnetic functionality. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes full advantage with its support of the Qi2.2 standard. This means that the Pro XL is the only phone of the trio that enjoys faster 25W wireless charging speeds, with the other two phones limited to 15W.</p><p>Nevertheless, it's great to see Google's entire flagship lineup offering sufficient battery life across the board. If you want the best, you'll need to snag the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b320027c-2c1e-4b8c-bf0f-1c6cb18344de">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wAMyi5no3iwzJCNSVKXCi6.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The longest-lasting Pixel</strong></em></p><p>Not only is the Pixel 10 Pro XL rated to last for more than 24 hours on a single charge, but it's equipped with faster wired and wireless charging speeds.

The affordable Meta Quest 3S boasts the same graphical processing power as its more-expensive big sibling, plus you get slightly better battery life, an improved facial interface for added comfort, and some upgraded low light tracking capabilities. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> also share the same Snapdragon chipset and 8GB of RAM, and you'll have access to the same library of games. </p><p>The regular Meta Quest 3 is still better than the Quest 3S in a few areas, namely resolution and FOV. The standard model also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack (which the Quest 3S lacks), and the Quest 3's pancake lenses generally offer a more next-gen experience than the 3S' Fresnel lens design. </p><p>You could compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs the Quest 3</a> until you're blue in the face, but in my opinion, it all comes down to price. If you're new to VR gaming or shopping for someone else this holiday season, I'd argue that the Quest 3S offers much more bang for the buck. Add on $144 of savings and purchasing the affordable headset becomes a no-brainer. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-47">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 and older models prompt you to set up life-saving safety and emergency features. Since you probably skipped that step to start playing with your new smartwatch, you need help setting up these features <em>now</em>, so that your Watch 4 can signal for help during a crisis, even in cellular dead zones.</p><p>You can update your emergency and medical info in two places. On your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>, swipe down from the main watch face, tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>, and scroll down to the <strong>Safety & Emergency menu</strong>. Or in the Pixel Watch mobile app, if your smartwatch is synced via Bluetooth, you'll find the same Safety & Emergency menu under <strong>Settings</strong> on the main app page.</p><p>Some Pixel Watch 4 features are automated; others require manual setup ahead of time, like Safety Check. This how-to guide runs through the Watch 4's surprisingly robust list of safety features that'll give you and your loved ones peace of mind — or potentially save your life.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-customize-emergency-sos-on-the-pixel-watch-4"><span>Set up and customize Emergency SOS on the Pixel Watch 4</span></h3><ol class="recipe-instruction-list" class="recipe-instruction-list" start="1"><li>On your Watch 4 (or older Pixel Watch model), open your <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll to <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>, and tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. If it isn't already, toggle the feature on.</li><li>Tap <strong>Ways to start SOS</strong>. By default, you must press the crown five times, then touch and hold the screen for three seconds. You can instead have the Watch 4 <strong>Automatically call</strong>; after the five button presses, it'll call 911 after a five-second delay.<ol><li>If you choose the latter option, decide whether to toggle <strong>Play a sound</strong> on or off; it's a loud chiming noise to warn you that it's about to call, with an option to cancel on the display.</li></ol></li><li>Lastly, choose <strong>Who to call for help</strong>. By default, Emergency SOS dials <strong>Emergency services</strong>, but you can instead choose a personal contact by tapping <strong>Manage contacts</strong> and choosing an option from your saved contacts.</li></ol><p>Switching to a personal contact makes Emergency SOS less "official." You have a quick shortcut to contact family members for help, with no fee for an ambulance or escalation to police, but there's no guarantee that they'll <em>answer</em> your call or respond quickly like 911 would.</p><p>I recommend leaving 911 as the default option. You can rely upon the <strong>Personal Safety</strong> app to contact family members.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-choose-what-information-is-shared-in-an-emergency"><span>Choose what information is shared in an emergency</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tRt3GY5SdEV8eBd5FKZDbT" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-personal-safety-app" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 showing the Personal Safety app, with Emergency Sharing and Safety Check options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRt3GY5SdEV8eBd5FKZDbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ol class="recipe-instruction-list" class="recipe-instruction-list" start="1"><li>Press the <strong>crown</strong> and select the <strong>Personal Safety</strong> app.</li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Emergency info access</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Share during emergency call</strong> to allow "Emergency Location Service" to share your GPS location and Medical Info with emergency responders.</li><li>Back in the main app view, tap <strong>Emergency contacts</strong> to manage your contacts; tap <strong>Add contact</strong> to add more or the trash can icon to remove contacts.</li><li>In the main app view, tap <strong>Medical Info</strong> and then <strong>Edit on phone</strong>.</li><li>On your connected device, you can add your <strong>date of birth, blood type, height, weight, allergies, pregnancy status, medications, address, organ donor status, and any other medical notes</strong>.

Skip to the next section if this doesn't apply.</p><p>Satellite SOS is enabled by default, so you don't need to "activate" it; if you call 911 when the watch can't connect to LTE or WiFi, a "Use satellite SOS?" prompt will appear. Tap <strong>Use satellite SOS</strong>, and your Watch 4 will turn off LTE, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi to prioritize the satellite connection.</p><p>The Watch 4 will instruct you to <strong>answer questions</strong> about your emergency on the display, choose whether to <strong>Notify emergency contacts</strong> in addition to 911, and then use on-screen prompts to help you position your Watch 4 and body to sync with the closest satellite. You must be standing <strong>outside with a clear view of the sky</strong> for the connection to work.</p><p>In other words, it's not designed to work if you're immobile or unconscious from a fall, and you won't <em>speak</em> to emergency responders over satellite; they'll receive a text message with your name, email, phone number, location, language preference, Watch 4 battery level, and emergency contact information via satellite. You'll then need to stay in the same position for at least a few minutes to receive a reply. This method ensures your Watch 4 battery life won't be severely impacted by satellite use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4052px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FJPnto3NkDyrPDk4KiwbJc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Satellite-communications-1" alt="Pixel Watch 4 searching for a satellite connection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJPnto3NkDyrPDk4KiwbJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4052" height="2279" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To test Satellite SOS without summoning 911, open your <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll to <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>, tap Satellite SOS, and tap <strong>Try a demo</strong>.

In fact, you can't enable Qi2 even by using a case. Only standard Qi wireless charging is supported.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-oneplus-15-settled-for-a-larger-battery-over-qi2-charging-2">The OnePlus 15 settled for a larger battery over Qi2 charging</h2><p>Battery life was clearly one of the top priorities when designing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>, and it shows. The massive 7,300mAh capacity commands a lot of space in the phone and since OnePlus didn't want it to feel like a brick in your pocket, it decided to ditch Qi2 charging. Rudolf Xu, senior product marketing manager at OnePlus, told Android Central that adding magnets in the phone would have made it too heavy and that they needed the space for the battery.</p><p>What's really surprising, though, is that the OnePlus 15 isn't even "Qi2 ready," which means you can't enable Qi2 charging even with a case. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series doesn't have built-in magnetic charging either, but it is Qi2-ready, which means you can do 15W wireless magnetic charging using the right case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC" name="oneplus-15-never-settle" alt="OnePlus's Never Settle logo on a OnePlus 15's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is this going to be a huge deal-breaker for most buyers? Probably not. The OnePlus 15 can charge at 50W wirelessly, which beats even the Qi2 25W standard, but you'll have to buy OnePlus' special wireless charger separately to enable this. There's also a ridiculously fast 120W wired charging speed (80W in the U.S.), and that charging brick comes in the box. Fast magnetic charging would have been nice to have, which would have made the OnePlus 15 work well with many existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> in the market.</p><p>While the OnePlus 15 scores big points on power and battery life, some other aspects have taken a back seat in order to keep the pricing nearly the same as the 13. The display has a slightly lower resolution than before, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera performance</a> doesn't break any new ground. If gaming and durability sit higher up on your wishlist over cameras and display resolution, I think you would be more than satisfied with what the OnePlus 15 offers.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="72b255f4-dfa2-4fe9-a6e4-2c7403b1d0e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:15,l:9,cw:484,ch:484,q:80/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Battery champion</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 packs one of the biggest batteries we've ever seen in a flagship phone, with a 7,300mAh capacity that dwarfs the competition.

Specifically, you're a self-guided runner who wants help improving your VO2 Max and hitting race PRs, and who cares more about their running watch feeling comfortable than looking "stylish."</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You're willing to trade away a week of battery life and certain premium features, downgrading to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1T9J4Y"><strong>Forerunner 265 for $299 (also $150 off)</strong></a>; or, you're willing to spend even <em>more</em> to get the newer fifth-generation health sensors, flashlight, mic/ speaker, and other perks available with a Forerunner 970 or Fenix 8.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oR7XWWutB7dhRjtyTZx3uG" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-training-effect.jpeg" alt="A post-run screen showing aerobic and anaerobic training effect on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oR7XWWutB7dhRjtyTZx3uG.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-vs-265">Forerunner 965 vs. 265</a> guide will break down the specific differences between the two, if you're feeling tempted to spend even less. When it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a>, you'll find plenty of options that can help you hit a PR, even without a deal; buying the Forerunner 965 is about letting yourself splurge on a watch that'll last you for years of training and give you insights you won't find anywhere else.</p><p>I do love my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, primarily for its twice-as-bright AMOLED display and new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> metric that judges how many miles per week your body can handle. But since Garmin hasn't discounted it and isn't likely to do so until 2026, the Forerunner 965 is the best premium running watch that won't break the bank.</p><p>The other "premium" Garmin watch that's relatively affordable is the Epix Pro (Gen 2) 42mm at $449, with the modern perks and steel body that the 965 lacks. But its display is 1.2 inches instead of 1.4, it only hits 10 days of battery life instead of 23, and it's slightly more uncomfortable; the bigger models last longer, but they also cost more and weigh <em>significantly</em> more. And I think a lot of Garmin fans will prefer comfortable workouts to steel style.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-52">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
