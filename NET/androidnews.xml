<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The global OPPO Reno 12 Pro could have 12GB of RAM and run on Android 14, compared to the Chinese version's 16GB of RAM.</li><li>It will reportedly feature a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor instead of the Chinese model's Dimensity 9200+.</li><li>The camera setup remains strong with a 50MP main camera, 50MP telephoto lens, and 8MP ultra-wide, plus a 50MP front camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OPPO&apos;s Reno 12 and 12 Pro made their debut in China last month, but these mid-range champions are hitting shelves worldwide soon, apparently with a few tweaks under the hood.</p><p>Before hitting the international market, the OPPO Reno 12 Pro 5G popped up on a Geekbench listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/oppo-reno-12-pro-geekbench-listing/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a>. The listing shows the global version will come with 12GB of RAM and run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Interestingly, the Chinese version of the Reno 12 Pro has a heftier 16GB of RAM. So, it looks like the global release will have just one base storage option.</p><p>Interestingly, the listing indicates a slight change in the chipset for the global version compared to the Chinese model. Though it&apos;s not confirmed, the Geekbench listing suggests the global Reno 12 Pro will feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor</a>. This guess comes from seeing four performance cores running at 2.50GHz and four efficiency cores at 2.0GHz.</p><p>So, it looks like the global version of the Reno 12 Pro is dialing down the processing power compared to the Chinese model. The Chinese version sports the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ chipset, while the global one seems to settle for the MediaTek Dimensity 7300. This might be a trade-off to cut costs.</p><p>Even though the global Reno 12 Pro will presumably have a more modest processor, there are some positives in the camera department. It&apos;s expected to keep the impressive triple-camera setup from the Chinese version. This means you&apos;ll get a powerful 50MP main camera with a Sony IMX890 sensor, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera. Plus, the global version should also have the same 50MP front camera, ensuring great selfies and video calls.</p><p>Despite the processor change, the global Reno 12 Pro also seems ready for heavy use with its rumored 4,880mAh battery. Plus, with 80W fast charging, you&apos;ll get quick power-ups.</p><p>The global version appears to keep a major strength from its Chinese counterpart: the display. Both the Pro and standard models are expected to feature a spacious 6.7-inch OLED display with FullHD+ resolution and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Though exact pricing for different regions isn&apos;t known yet, the competitive pricing in China suggests that the global Reno 12 lineup will also target the mid-range market. This makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious users looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">feature-packed smartphone</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s sub-brand is brewing a budget phone, the CMF Phone 1, with new rumors of a surprise Dimensity 7300 chipset.</p><p>Last week, CMF <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1798640847824822400" target="_blank">unveiled the CMF Phone 1</a>, a fresh face in the smartphone scene. It stands out with a unique design featuring a mysterious knob on the back. This quirky addition has tech fans buzzing, guessing what it might do.</p><p>Initially, rumors had the CMF Phone 1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-cmf-phone-1-might-have-a-little-surprise-in-store">sporting a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 processor</a>. But a recent leak from leaker @gadget_bits on X (formerly Twitter) hints at an upgrade to the new Dimensity 7300 SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/cmf-phone-1-chipset-key-specs-concept-image-tipped/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CONFIRMED]: The CMF Phone 1 is equipped with the newly launched MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor. The device also comes with a SD Card slot.CPU- 4x 2.5GHz- 4x 2.0GHxGPU- Arm Mali-G615 MC2#CMFPhone1 #CMFByNothing #Nothing pic.twitter.com/BLKa7Howhx<a href="https://twitter.com/gadget_bits/status/1799378643967414562">June 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, this chip isn&apos;t a direct follow-up to the Dimensity 7200 but builds on the Dimensity 7050. Performance-wise, it’s expected to match the Snapdragon 778G+ found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a>.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that @gadget_bits&apos; leak hasn&apos;t been verified. The source hasn&apos;t built a reputation for reliable leaks, so take this detail with a grain of salt.</p><p>In May, MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">introduced the Dimensity 7300 series</a>, calling them "ultra-efficient 4nm chips" built for top-notch mobile performance. These chipsets aim to deliver smooth multitasking, advanced AI processing, faster gaming, and better mobile photography.</p><p>The upcoming OPPO Reno 12 Pro is set to feature the Dimensity 7300. Geekbench 6 benchmarks show a single-core score of 1,043 and a multi-core score of 2,944, putting it in the same league as the Nothing Phone 1. So, if the CMF Phone 1 has the same chipset, you can expect similar performance.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 will be the first phone release from Nothing&apos;s new sub-brand. Building on the success of its parent company in the competitive smartphone market, CMF is set to make a strong entry with this debut device.</p><p>Since it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-could-be-way-cheaper-than-nothings-budget-phones">expected to be a budget device</a>, the CMF Phone 1 won&apos;t be going head-to-head with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a>. This smart move could help it shake up the lower price segment, where a new contender might have a better chance than in the crowded high-end market.</p><p>Moreover, the phone stands out with its unique design aesthetic, sure to grab attention when it launches. However, how this unconventional design will hold up in everyday use is still uncertain.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>In late 2023, Amazon's big banner ad on the home screen triggered autoplay video ads, disrupting the user experience and causing dissatisfaction.</li><li>A recent redesign moved ads to a smaller mini-player, reducing screen space taken up by promotions.</li><li>Automatic playback is also removed; ads now appear with a brief delay, making them less disruptive.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon is rolling out a user-friendly redesign of Fire TV ads, making them less intrusive for viewers.</p><p>In late 2023, Amazon made a bold move by changing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Fire TV</a> user interface. Instead of the usual navigation menu as the starting point, the platform introduced a big banner ad that takes up a lot of the home screen. Just hovering over this banner would trigger an autoplay video ad, hitting users with unsolicited content right from the start. This change really threw off the familiar user experience and left a lot of people unhappy.</p><p>Even though there was an option to disable autoplay ads, the default setting was still disruptive and intrusive. This update forced users to watch unsolicited video ads right when they started up their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">beloved Fire TV devices</a>, even before they had a chance to engage with the platform.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/amazon-is-making-its-full-screen-video-ads-on-fire-tvs-less-annoying/" target="_blank">CordCuttersNews</a> reveals that a redesign on the Fire TV platform has significantly reduced the disruption caused by these ads. The change moves promotional content to a dedicated mini-player, taking up much less space on the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XXXfBA8kN6RS2BvnNwWnDK" name="amazon-fire-tv-ads.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV pop-up ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXXfBA8kN6RS2BvnNwWnDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CordCuttersNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the mini-player only shows a limited view of apps, the interface is still accessible, now positioned at the bottom of the screen. This redesign is expected to roll out to all Fire TV devices released since 2016.</p><p>Additionally, the automatic playback is gone. Now, users will encounter a brief delay before any promotional content appears, reducing the immediate disruption that many found annoying.</p><p>Basically, with the new Fire TV interface, you can start using apps or browsing before any ads start playing. This is different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, where video ads automatically start when you reach the featured content section.</p><p>The revamped Fire TV interface also lets users skip ads easily with a press of the home button or by setting up a shortcut on their controller.</p><p>Of course, pop-up video ads are common on smart TV platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a>, but there&apos;s a key difference. Usually, ads only play when users interact, like hovering over them. However, the previous setup on Fire TV automatically launched video ads without any user input, making it a lot more disruptive, until now.</p>

<hr>
<p>Humane has instructed owners of its $700 AI Pin device to "immediately" cease using its charging case due to a potential fire hazard.</p><p>After looking into a report about a charging problem, Humane found a battery quality issue in the AI Pin&apos;s Charge Case Accessory, which was supplied by a third-party vendor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172377/humane-ai-pin-battery-case-issue-warning" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reports.</p><p>Although Humane didn&apos;t confirm if the charging issue caused an actual fire, the company did find that some battery cells from this vendor could be a fire hazard.</p><p>On the other hand, the AI Pin itself, along with its battery booster and charging pad, are safe; the problem is only with the charging case parts.</p><p>“Our investigation determined that the battery supplier was no longer meeting our quality standards and that there is a potential that certain battery cells supplied by this vendor may pose a fire safety risk,” Humane wrote in an email to customers, which was published on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/27328584972557-Stop-Use-Notice-for-Charge-Case-Accessory" target="_blank">support website</a>. “As a result, we immediately disqualified this battery vendor while we work to identify a new vendor to avoid such issues and maintain our high quality standards.”</p><p>"While we know this may cause an inconvenience to you, customer safety is our priority at Humane," the company wrote.</p><p>To make up for it, Humane is offering two free months of its subscription service, which is needed for most of the AI Pin’s features. The company hasn&apos;t said yet if it will replace the faulty charging cases.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Humane for more information on its plans to replace the charging cases and will update this article when we get a response.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">AI Pin’s launch has been rocky</a>, with harsh reviews pointing out many issues with its basic features like on-palm projection and gesture controls. There are also reports that Humane <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">might be looking to sell the company</a> just weeks after launching the AI Pin, adding to the device’s troubled start.</p>

<p>WWDC 2024 starts tomorrow, June 10, and iPhones are about to get inundated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/apple/the-name-of-apples-ai-overhaul-just-leaked-and-its-so-obvious-you-probably-could-have-guessed">Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?)</a>, according to a major leak. Given Google and Samsung&apos;s pivot to AI, it&apos;s an unsurprising shift for the brand. Personally, I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">less interested in the industry&apos;s AI shift</a> and more intrigued by what Apple Intelligence could mean for Apple Fitness.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more?sref=HrWXCALa" target="_blank">Bloomberg&apos;s Mark Gurman</a>, who leaked the laundry list of AI features coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/apple/wwdc-2024-expected-date-new-software-hardware-and-more">WWDC 2024</a>, promises that Apple will announce "major" changes to the Fitness app, along with Health changes like "improved blood pressure data management" and "cycle tracking."</p><p>He doesn&apos;t specify what major AI changes Fitness will receive, but I&apos;m looking at Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">recent Galaxy AI fitness announcement</a> for clues. The South Korean company promised a daily Energy Score, AI Wellness Tips for losing weight and other life goals, and personalized workout routines to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p><p>Why bring this up? Because I suddenly find Samsung&apos;s timing suspicious. Why reveal this in May when the new Galaxy Watch won&apos;t ship until August? Maybe Samsung guessed that Apple would announce similar AI fitness tricks at WWDC 2024 and wanted to be the "first" to reveal them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="48u5nEpTyEqp4YqnP9NzTV" name="Apple-Craig-federighi-running.jpeg" alt="Apple engineer Craig Federighi running in a WWDC 2022 livestream" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48u5nEpTyEqp4YqnP9NzTV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>My</em> guess is that Apple Fitness will add its own "daily readiness" score, following in the footsteps of Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, and other brands. It has all the data necessary, from sleep stages and resting HR to stress and activity tracking. It simply needs a sufficient algorithm to interpret that data properly.</p><p>Apple Fitness Plus already offers some of the best guided at-home workouts, but it&apos;s possible Siri could start pointing you to specific routines based on your fitness level, muscle map, and tiredness. Perhaps it could tell you whether you have the strength to complete a second routine, based on your heart rate data during the first routine.</p><p>My personal hope is that Apple Intelligence will be able to suggest daily running or cycling workouts by time, length, and pace, based on your VO2 Max — just as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can. For instance, it could recommend a harder pace when you&apos;re well-rested, then a light jog the following day.</p><p>Or, Apple could take more of a Fitbit-esque approach, recommending you hit a certain amount of Active Zone Minutes per day based on your energy level. Apple could make its daily rings more dynamic, adjusting your movement and stand goals as necessary so you&apos;re improving but not overtraining. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">worn the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for months</a> on and off, and have been quite satisfied with its accuracy for GPS, steps, elevation, and other tests I&apos;ve conducted. Samsung promised that its Galaxy AI pivot would deliver "enhanced health algorithms" for "greater precision and accuracy," so it&apos;s possible Apple could improve even further. </p><p>But accurate data during a workout isn&apos;t enough. Apple and Samsung need to show they can understand and process that data to build a personal profile and guide you down the right path. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">Fitness watch</a> brands like Garmin, COROS, and Polar have built their brands and loyal followings off their ability to coach you based on your abilities instead of assigning a generic 30-minute workout ring to close.</p>

<p>Apple probably intends to make its AI a fitness coach, just as Samsung does. And it&apos;s an exciting development! I&apos;ve been waiting for more mainstream smartwatches to try their hands at coaching. The question will be whether either brand can pull it off and give proper advice to both couch-to-5Kers and proper athletes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> is the rare mainstream watch to have coaching, thanks to Google&apos;s Fitbit acquisition, but the most recent Fitbit updates have focused on new health sensors. We haven&apos;t seen many updates to Fitbit&apos;s <em>coaching</em> in years. The Galaxy Watch 7 and Apple Watch X entering the fray would challenge Google to innovate, and give consumers more options for at-home coaching.</p><p>Or perhaps I&apos;m misreading what "major" Apple Fitness changes are coming, and we won&apos;t get <em>any</em> Apple Intelligence updates. We&apos;ll find out at WWDC 2024 tomorrow if Apple is evolving or falling behind the pack.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor floating around says Samsung might let you check the time on your Galaxy phone with just a double tap, even when the screen is off.</p><p>As spotted by tipster Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter), Samsung is developing an update for the RegiStar module in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app, which will supposedly introduce a new feature that allows you to tap the back of your phone twice to check the time (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/06/samsung-android-15-double-tap-time-good-lock/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This new functionality is said to debut on the next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Flip 6.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Exclusive: Double Tap to Check Time (Even with Screen Off!)‼️The first feature for One UI 7 & One UI 6.1.1 is GoodLock RegiStar's "Check Time with Back Tap" - coming soon to your Galaxy phone!Repost 👯‍♀️👬https://t.co/CMHyQQBw5D#GalaxyS24 #OneUI #Samsung #OneUI7<a href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1798651936524394681">June 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Launched with Android 13-based One UI 5</a>, the RegiStar module lets Galaxy phone users customize their interface. With RegiStar, you can change what happens when you long-press the side key and set actions like taking a screenshot with a double-tap on the back of the device.</p><p>Currently, the Back-Tap function requires the phone&apos;s display to be on. However, with the upcoming One UI 6.1.1 update, Samsung plans to change that. The new update will add a feature allowing Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 users to check the time by double-tapping the back of their device, even when the screen is turned off.</p><p>This feature might be expanded to more Galaxy devices in the future. This broader rollout is expected to happen with the release of One UI 7, which is likely to be Samsung&apos;s version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>This feature seemingly aims to take the Back-Tap option in RegiStar to the next level. It may sound perfect for situations where the display is hard to see, such as in bright sunlight.</p><p>But since many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">favorite Galaxy devices</a> already have an always-on display and other options to check the time with a simple tap or by raising the device, the new double-tap-to-check-time feature raises questions about its practical utility. It&apos;s unclear if this new method will significantly enhance the user experience or address a specific, yet unidentified, user need.</p><p>While the usefulness of the upcoming feature might be up for debate, it&apos;s still a cool upgrade for the RegiStar module. It lets you do more without needing the screen on. Samsung will probably keep other Back Tap actions disabled when the screen is off to avoid accidental triggers.</p>

The timeline, originally named "location history," is a feature that lets you keep track of the places you&apos;ve visited and the routes traveled. </p><p>In December 2023, Google changed where the location history was being stored. Users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default) will see Google Maps&apos; Timeline saved directly on their device rather than the web, giving them even more control over their data. </p><p>This means that if you access Google Maps on the web, the Timeline will not show any history of the places you&apos;ve visited. Instead, the company is pushing users to download the app and continue accessing the feature. </p><p>Users have until December 1, 2024, to shift from the web version to the app. Otherwise, all the saved data will be lost. However, the company says it will try moving up to 90 days of Timeline data to the "first-signed- device" after the deadline. Any routes or visits made before that period will be auto-deleted.</p>

As a result of the change, Spotify Premium will cost more than other competing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Apple Music and Tidal. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2024-06-03/adjusting-spotify-premium-prices-in-the-us/" target="_blank">press release</a>, as well as in an email to subscribers, Spotify justified the price increase by saying it would allow it to "invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices."</p><p>"Over the next month, subscribers in the U.S. will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscription."</p><p>The price for a Premium Individual plan is now $11.99, a dollar more than the old rate. Spotify Premium Duo is up by $2 and costs $16.99—the old price of the Spotify Premium Family plan. Premium Family will now cost $19.99, a $3 increase. The updated prices are being rolled out nearly a year after Spotify&apos;s last price hike, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-to-bump-up-its-premium-pricing">which was in July 2023</a>. </p><p>Additionally, a discovery in Google&apos;s app suggests that the company is working on a Spotify extension for Gemini. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-extension-potential-code-strings-discovered">spotted</a> in version <strong>15.22.2</strong> of the Google app, a Spotify extension for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> might be coming. The availability of a Spotify extension would (ideally) let users quickly access their created playlists and discover songs, genres, artists, and more. Gemini will alert users with a string that reads, "starting to play on Spotify." This looks like a message users see after telling the AI to play a certain song or playlist.</p>

The policy, effective since July 19 of last year, grants Google the right to retain Pixel devices sent in for repair if unauthorized components are discovered.</p><p>The specific clause, as found on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-14530025?sid=ac-ca-1235900637360103068&url=https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">website</a>, states: "You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you."</p><p>This policy creates a conflict between your right to fix your own phone and Google&apos;s desire to keep things under its control. Google&apos;s repair policy extends to any accessories, like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-cases">favorite Pixel 8 cases</a>, which will likely be relegated to the lost and found bin, assuming your phone even passes the "authorized parts" inspection.</p><p>However, following significant backlash from customers, the company says it will not retain phones for repair due to non-OEM parts.</p><p>"If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether the phone has non-OEM parts or not," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. "In certain situations, we won&apos;t be able to complete a repair if there are safety concerns. In that case, we will either send the phone back to the customer or work with them to determine next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this."</p>

You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-8-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6559251.p"><strong>save $250 on the Google Pixel 8 Pro at Best Buy</strong></a> right now, offering a premium phone with a high-quality camera for way less than the normal sticker price. Beyond its powerful suite of cameras, the Pixel 8 Pro boasts quick, smooth performance due to the capable Google Tensor G3 chipset, useful AI features, and a long-term software support promise to assure buyers it&apos;ll keep getting better. It also has a super-bright, eye-friendly AMOLED display that measures about 6.7 inches.</p>

<p>The awesome <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> is on sale at Best Buy right now, ringing in at $250 less than the normal price when you buy unlocked. Most of all, we love this phone for its powerful cameras, but there's honestly a lot to appreciate when it comes to this premium Google phone. While it's normally pretty pricey, this deal slashes 25% off the price, so you can get more for less.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Pixel-Pixel-8-Pro-128GB-6-7-5G-Fully-Unlocked-Black/5709418057">Walmart - $739.13</a> | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">Amazon - $749.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-8-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6559251.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dda7f01b-7da5-4f45-afe0-af92ed0e3da8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.00" data-dimension48="$999.00">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you take a lot of photos and/or videos and want a powerful camera; having a phone with a long-lasting battery is a major priority for you; you want a phone with a long-term software update promise.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather get an even cheaper phone and would be better suited with a budget-friendly option; you just want the best gaming phone available and are willing to pay a higher price.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phone</a> for parents, but pretty much anyone who appreciates a high-quality suite of cameras and strong performance will like this premium smartphone. It also has an excellent 6.7-inch AMOLED display that&apos;s easy on the eyes, a long-lasting battery, and seven years of Android updates—making it a model you know will improve over time.</p><p>Even with smooth performance across most of the phone&apos;s applications, gaming isn&apos;t a strong suit for the Pixel 8 Pro. Still, most casual gamers will get what they need out of it, especially with the camera offerings that make this phone so worthwhile.</p><p>There are still cheaper phones out there to be sure, even with this discount. However, if you were already in the market for a premium phone, than an extra $250 off might not hurt, especially spent on a phone this powerful.</p>

Everyone is up in arms about new terms and conditions from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/adobe-express-app-launch">Adobe</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram">Meta</a> that tell us how they plan to use our photos to bolster their AI. Predictably, we all hate it.</p><p>Equally predictable was the freakout everyone was having that wasn&apos;t really necessary. You can opt out of both, and at least we finally know what both companies plan to do—they were always going to try to use our publically shared data for AI training. Telling us in writing is a good thing.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>I&apos;m not saying that either company does any of this the right way. Adobe and Meta have (or will, Meta&apos;s new policy won&apos;t go into effect until June 26) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/on-by-default-your-apps-are-sharing-more-than-you-think">automatically opted us in</a>, making the option to say no difficult to find. That&apos;s really crappy behavior, but we see it from every tech company almost every time.</p><p>For Adobe, visit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://account.adobe.com/privacy">your account&apos;s privacy settings</a>, find the <strong>Content Analysis</strong> section, and toggle the switch off.</p><p>For Meta, the <em>new</em> privacy policy will have a "<strong>Right to object</strong>" link that allows you to fill out a form to opt out. You might have seen people with early access sharing this, and you&apos;ll have the same option once it goes live.</p><p>So yeah, both companies hide things, and it&apos;s not an accident. They want your data on Instagram and things you share with Creative Cloud to make their jobs a little easier and to make a little more money.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the thing—it seems like nobody looked into it before they freaked out. If you&apos;re mad at the way a company automatically enrolls you into its new level of bullshit or how it hides the way you can say no, right on. But going off about how you&apos;re being forced to do something is, well, it&apos;s just silly. Wrong and silly. Nobody hates these giant tech company monsters more than I do, and I&apos;m not defending them. I simply want the collective rage to focus on the right things.</p><p>I know how to fix it, and you&apos;ll hate my idea: how about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">reading things before you automatically say yes</a>?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gYjh4cynapwxrRRJJc3coJ" name="galaxy-watch-5-review-google-terms-of-service.jpg" alt="Review Google's Terms of Service on Galaxy S21 FE when setting up Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYjh4cynapwxrRRJJc3coJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reading would have stopped the "Adobe is stealing all my company NDA work!!!!!1111!!!!!!" nonsense in its tracks. Once Instagram uses the new updated Meta policies, we will see more of the same because people aren&apos;t reading what it says. </p><p>I consider myself fairly smart and tech-savvy, but I also think most people are equally smart and tech-savvy if they want to be. The big difference is that I know not to trust these tech companies. </p><p>Tech companies do everything they can get away with to make sure any agreement is in their favor. When you buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a new phone</a> and sign in to all your stuff, you are just a faceless number who will be treated like a dairy cow and milked for everything a company can get. I realize how cynical this sounds, but I&apos;ve also realized that it&apos;s true. Fifteen years of experience investigating and writing about these companies has taught me not to trust any of them.</p>
<p>It&apos;s fine to use and even enjoy the products and services they have to offer, and I do. You should too. But you should never trust them to do anything except find ways to make more money from you and your data. </p><p>You need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-clarifies-its-new-policy-update-says-users-privacy-wont-be-affected">read everything they tell you</a>, and that includes following the countless links to other obscure documents that explain what it all means. If everyone did that, nobody would think canceling an Adobe subscription is the only way to keep your files out of their greedy claws. You should cancel because it&apos;s too expensive and there are alternatives out there, not because you don&apos;t understand a thing you didn&apos;t read, but because someone said you should hate it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="kKXPppDctg8dabDnasMErX" name="Polar-editor.jpg" alt="Polarr Photo Editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKXPppDctg8dabDnasMErX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>This goes double for people like me</strong>. If you write about tech and didn&apos;t lead a story about Adobe&apos;s new policy with a way to opt out, you&apos;re bad at your job. Do better. Investigate so you can tell people how to stop what&apos;s happening, then explain why the policy exists and why it&apos;s bad. You might not get as many social rage-bait shares, but maybe you&apos;ll help someone instead.</p><p>Companies have entire teams to figure out how to tip the scales in their favor and hide what&apos;s happening in boring documents filled with quasi-legal words in the hopes that nobody will read or understand them. We don&apos;t. We can only do our best to understand what&apos;s happening, ask questions when we&apos;re unsure, and never agree because we feel overwhelmed. </p><p>That&apos;s what they want you to do, and no amount of complaining on social media will change it.</p>

<ul><li>The Meta Quest 3 June v66 update addresses issues with mixed reality motion capture.</li><li>Moving objects using the headset's cameras no longer "warp" the environment around them.</li><li>This builds on the recent HDR improvements in mixed reality vision, bringing the Quest 3's mixed reality quality closer to Apple Vision Pro standards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of the hallmark features of the Meta Quest 3 is its color passthrough vision which allows users to see the room around them even while wearing the headset. While Meta substantially improved the passthrough quality compared to the Quest 2 and Quest Pro, moving objects still featured a near-nausea-inducing warp around them.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-update-v66-beta-features">Meta Quest 3 update v66</a> addresses this issue by nearly completely removing the warping that plagued prior firmware versions. Moving objects, like hands or even your smartphone, will no longer warp the area around them as they did before. Meta previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">upgraded the passthrough capture quality</a> in the April v64 update and this builds upon that update.</p><p>It&apos;s a huge step in the right direction and brings the Meta Quest 3&apos;s passthrough quality up to par with Apple Vision Pro standards, a headset that costs seven times as much as Meta&apos;s flagship standalone mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>My video above showcases the substantial difference in passthrough quality between the previous v65 May update and the new v66 June update, closing that all-important mixed reality quality gap between Meta and Apple&apos;s headsets. Meta announced that the update would be available for all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/summer-games-fest-has-already-begun-for-the-meta-quest-3">earlier this week</a>, but it took a few days for my Quest 3 to get the new feature.</p><p>If your headset doesn&apos;t look as good just yet, give it a restart by holding down the power button and tapping restart. Once you&apos;ve got the v66 June update, things will start looking substantially better.</p><p>Now that mixed reality games <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">have gotten really good</a> and this new update improves quality so much, that upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alo-moves-yoga-mixed-reality-quest-3">mixed reality yoga game by Alo Moves</a> makes a lot more sense now.</p><p>Given that we&apos;re expecting to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">Meta Connect 2024</a> — a cheaper headset that&apos;s rumored to still feature color passthrough like the more expensive Quest 3 — this update should help Meta further build out on its mantra that Quest headsets are now mixed reality instead of virtual reality.</p>
