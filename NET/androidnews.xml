<ul><li>The Galaxy Ring made a pitstop at the FCC, and with it came confirmation about ring sizes, battery capacities, and a charging "cradle."</li><li>The device will hit the market in nine sizes, and its battery capacity ranges from 17mAh to 22.5mAh.</li><li>The FCC listing also spoiled a charging "cradle," though it contains little information besides a photo of its underside.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s upcoming first-generation smart ring is passing through its certification hoops, but its stop at the FCC spills more than expected.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/28/samsungs-galaxy-ring-stops-through-fcc-and-shows-off-everything/">DroidLife</a>, the Galaxy Ring is listed under the FCC ID "A3LSMQ503" within its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=GVBTaMEJp%2FstsNDsvLc3Aw%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSMQ503">official report</a>. From the listing, it seems confirmed that the device will hit the market with nine models, each with its respective ring size. Information about eight of the sizes, minus SM-Q503, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>SM-Q500 (Size 10)</li><li>SM-Q501 (Size 11)</li><li>SM-Q502 (Size 12)</li><li>SM-Q505 (Size 5)</li><li>SM-Q506 (Size 6)</li><li>SM-Q507 (Size 7)</li><li>SM-Q508 (Size 8)</li><li> SM-Q509 (Size 9)</li></ul>

<p>The FCC&apos;s listing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> contained battery information for each device. Ring sizes five through seven will feature a 17mAh battery. Sizes eight through eleven boast 18.5mAh batteries, while the larger size 12 Galaxy Ring sees a 22.5mAh capacity battery.</p><p>The listing continues by quickly mentioning a "charging cradle" for the Galaxy Ring. More substantial information about it is unknown, aside from a picture of the cradle&apos;s apparent underside to highlight the FCC&apos;s marking. The listing reportedly details that Samsung will label each cradle according to whichever model (and ring size) a consumer has purchased.</p>

<p>The publication also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=7352716">official photos of the rings</a>, courtesy of Samsung. The pictures show off the device in various sizes and from different angles. Additionally, it seems the device will connect to devices via Bluetooth LE.</p><p>An earlier leak from March suggested that the Galaxy Ring could run for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">about 10 days</a>. It then dipped into the potential battery sizes of the device, purporting its smallest size could see a 14.5mAh battery while the largest could sit at 21.5mAh. However, with the current FCC listing, those numbers have increased slightly at both ends.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">we&apos;ve heard rumors</a> about Samsung&apos;s potential to bring nine Galaxy Ring sizes to consumers based on American ring sizes. There was speculation that the ninth would either be given an "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model number; we&apos;ve now seen that it&apos;s the former. Still, information about SM-Q503 is unknown. There&apos;s a chance this device takes the ring size up to 13, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>We expect Samsung to debut its Galaxy Ring, among several other devices, during its summer Unpacked event. Rumors state this could happen on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Well-known PC and Android browser, Opera, has highlighted its latest AI feature drop, and this one comes with a little Google magic.</p><p>Today (May 28), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.opera.com/2024/05/28/opera-google-cloud-aria-gemini/">Opera announced</a> that it has started collaborating with Google Cloud to integrate its Gemini AI models into its in-browser AI, Aria. The company states that Gemini will enable the Opera browser to provide users with "the most current information, at high performance."</p><p>Opera reiterates Aria&apos;s design, which is that of a multi-LLM Composer AI engine. This gives the browser a chance to "curate" a better experience for users based on what they may need. Moreover, Aria piggybacks off multiple LLMs (large language models). Opera states that Aria will choose the best AI model to handle a user&apos;s task based on their "intent."</p><p>AI is woven through both the regular Opera browser and the OperaGX browser, geared toward PC gamers. Gemini will likely appear in both instances, however, Opera has not said when we should expect this.</p><p>This collaboration continues as Opera states Aria will soon pick up image generation and voice output capabilities. Courtesy of the work with Google Cloud, the Opera browser will deliver free image generation features to users through Google&apos;s Imagen 2 model on Vertex AI.</p><p>Additionally, Aria is being upgraded with "conversational-like" voice output, which lets the AI read its responses aloud to users.</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">Imagen 2</a>, a text-to-image generation model, late in 2023. It was stated that the software could create "photorealistic" imagery based on users&apos; prompts. There was also the hope that Imagen 2 could rid users of some "typical problems" those types of bots are prone to.</p><p>Since then, during I/O 2024, the company unveiled its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements#:~:text=Imagen%203%20and%20Google%20Veo">Imagen 3 model</a>. The idea of creating photorealistic and life-like imagery remains the same with this new software. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Google explained</a> that Imagen 3 takes it a step further as users should experience an increase in detail across the board. Natural speech and the intent behind your prompt are areas where Imagen 3 was said to be better than its predecessor.</p>

<ul><li>A notable tipster dove into the latest Find My Device app version to discover a new biometric security option for users.</li><li>To bolster a user's personal security, the feature might work in tandem with the "don't ask again" box for the basic Google account sign-in.</li><li>Google teased "Remote Lock" for Find My Device at I/O, stating users can remotely close off their devices with their phone number and a security challenge.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Google continues to expand its new Find My Device network to more users, plans to strengthen its security appear.</p><p>As spotted by AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-biometric-login-apk-teardown-3446345/">Android Authority</a>, the app&apos;s code spills an extra biometric security layer. From the app&apos;s latest version, the biometric option was produced on the same page asking for your Google account credentials. </p><p>When enabled, users should be able to sign in quickly using their fingerprints.</p><p>This will likely give users more peace of mind when toggling the "don&apos;t ask again" option when using their Google account password. It&apos;s suspected that the two will work in tandem as users can leave their credentials saved on their devices backed with an extra layer that verifies their identity.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans to roll out its biometric security layer in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device#section-how-to-lock-your-phone-with-find-my-device">Find My Device</a> app. However, the tipster thinks it could happen when the network is more "commonplace."</p><p>AssembleDebug was then able to produce Google&apos;s planned "Remote Lock" function for the network&apos;s app. Produced thanks to a recent Play Services update, the feature&apos;s framework appeared, but without any proper functionality.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">teased Remote Lock</a> during I/O 2024, stating users can lock their phones down by using their phone number and completing a security challenge. We&apos;re not expecting this until "later this year," following Play Services to enable it properly.</p>

<p>Regarding a more common network, Google started rolling Find My Device out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">to more users</a> earlier in May. Shortly before I/O 2024, folks in Japan and the U.K. spotted the new network appearing on their device. Moreover, even more users in the U.S. started noticing the app appear updated on their phones. The network&apos;s expansion was joined by an extended cast of devices ready to support its functionality.</p><p>We started noticing its availability on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> while picking it up on the Moto Razr Plus.</p><p>One thing to note is that Google&apos;s Pixel series can be located <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">without powe</a>r or when the device is shut down.

<hr>
<p>The idea of Wear OS 5 debuting this year changed from being just a rumor to becoming a certainty rather quickly, with Google officially previewing the upcoming operating system at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. Now that Wear OS 5 is official, we&apos;re already looking ahead to the first beta. Wear OS updates are developed as part of a joint effort between Google and Samsung, and Galaxy Watches are often the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> to get Wear OS betas first. That&apos;s why recent rumors have suggested a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Wear OS 5 beta for the Galaxy Watch 6</a> could be imminent. </p><p>Those rumors intensified over the last few days when one X (formerly Twitter) user spotted an official Samsung forum page for the One UI Watch 6 beta. Samsung is one version number ahead of Wear OS, so the One UI Watch 6 release will be our first glimpse of Wear OS 5 on actual hardware.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 6 Watch beta incoming...👀Who's ready?#OneUI6Watch #OneUIBeta pic.twitter.com/jU94LG5D7t<a href="https://twitter.com/theordysm/status/1793589393216926119">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This forum page, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/26/samsung-wear-os-5-galaxy-watch-beta/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first reported on, indicates that the first Wear OS 5 beta could be just weeks away. Although this specific page doesn&apos;t provide any new information, the fact that it is live at all could mean Galaxy Watch 6 devices will receive the One UI Watch 6 beta soon. </p><p>A new version upgrade is always exciting, and the possibility that Wear OS could be moving to a yearly release schedule could be even more exciting. But a consequence of that consistency, and the way Google releases Wear OS features, is that annual Wear OS upgrades will get more boring. They&apos;ll be more like watchOS, and that has pros and cons. </p>
<h2 id="wear-os-5-doesn-apos-t-look-like-a-big-upgrade-2">Wear OS 5 doesn&apos;t look like a big upgrade</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-app.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea that Wear OS updates are becoming less exciting isn&apos;t just speculation. The jump from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4 wasn&apos;t a massive one, and early indications are that Wear OS 4 to Wear OS 5 could be an even smaller one. Aside from battery life improvements and changes to the Watch Face Format, there isn&apos;t a ton <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces&apos;">new with Wear OS 5 this year</a>, at least based on what Google has announced thus far. While those changes are appreciated — especially the battery life boost — they aren&apos;t exactly exciting. </p><p>Google specifically notes that workout tracking will be more efficient while running Wear OS 5. During a marathon, the company says Wear OS 5 will use up to 20% less power than Wear OS 4, which targets a particular segment of smartwatch users like Android Central&apos;s Michael Hicks, who writes our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a> column. Battery life improvements will indeed be the biggest user-facing Wear OS 5 upgrade. Everything else, from the Watch Face Format changes to using Android 14 as a base, is more developer-focused. </p>
<h2 id="wear-os-is-going-the-way-of-watchos-2">Wear OS is going the way of watchOS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aKsQ2PKB9YkEFnsyv2WML3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-and-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2.jpeg" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKsQ2PKB9YkEFnsyv2WML3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the fact that "boring" Wear OS upgrades may become the norm is a compliment. Previously, there was so much wrong with Wear OS that we would see and get excited about big leaps between version upgrades. Now that annual Wear OS upgrades are on the horizon, it&apos;s impossible not to make a comparison between WatchOS and WearOS. WatchOS is the operating system that Apple Watches run, and it&apos;s arguably the most successful smartwatch OS released to date. </p><p>Apple is nearing 10 years of the Apple Watch, and WatchOS progress has slowed over the last few years. When an operating system matures, there are limits to how many improvements can be made year-over-year. Apple usually includes a big feature or two in each version of watchOS, and they&apos;re occasionally tied to new Apple Watch hardware. Wear OS upgrades will become just like WatchOS upgrades, with a feature or an improvement coming each year, but not much else. </p><p>Again, the fact that we can even make this comparison shows just how far Samsung and Google have come in reviving the Wear OS platform. It also means we shouldn&apos;t expect massive year-over-year changes that overhaul the Wear OS experience. It&apos;s more likely that Wear OS will evolve over a longer period of time, with one or two version upgrades needed to make a noticeable difference. </p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-more-to-it-than-yearly-updates-2">There&apos;s more to it than yearly updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-white-band-purple-watchface-turn-crown.jpg" alt="Turning the crown on the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor that will contribute to less exciting yearly Wear OS upgrades is the way Google releases features and changes. Unlike Apple, Google doesn&apos;t stock up on features for annual Wear OS releases. Instead, the company likes to release them throughout the year. </p><p>A new Wear OS feature might debut as part of a quarterly release, like a feature drop. It could even appear in a monthly security update, like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-april-2024-update-rollout">Google added Vibration Watch to the Pixel Watch</a> as part of the April 2024 update, although these tend to be Pixel-specific additions. Some users might prefer this release schedule because features are rolled out when they&apos;re ready instead of being held for a yearly upgrade.</p><p>Despite that benefit, it has the consequence of limiting the impact annual Wear OS releases can have. We&apos;ll see what exactly Wear OS 5 has in store when the beta releases in a few weeks, assuming the rumors are correct. Barring a miracle, it won&apos;t be all that exciting, and Wear OS users should get used to that. There are a handful of great things that have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">come with Wear OS&apos; maturity</a>, but that also means upgrades like Wear OS 5 just won&apos;t be as exciting.</p>

<p>USB-C takes on many forms and shapes, one of them being Thunderbolt. You may have heard of it, or you may be completely unaware of its existence. In any case, I believe this connectivity protocol can be the groundbreaking solution that USB-C so desperately needs. Before I dive into why I think so, let me explain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters#section-faq">what USB-C is</a> and its many protocols and specs.</p><p>Any explainer on the internet will tell you that USB Type-C is the oval 24-pin connector that is now found in the majority of phones, tablets, 2-in-1s, mobile accessories, and even some laptops and PCs. But not all USB-C ports are created equal. The capability of your Type-C port greatly varies depending on its USB specs. Just because your device has a USB-C port doesn&apos;t mean that it has the latest specs.</p><p>The specs of your USB-C port dictate its compatible charging speeds and data transfer rates. Understanding the different USB specs can boggle your mind because the USB Implementers Forum has not made it easy to understand. The names and types are extremely confusing. For example, USB 3.2 Gen 1 is the same as USB 3.0, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 is completely different from USB 3.2 Gen 1, while USB4 builds on previous versions of the spec.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7FehXB3CK2WiFJgig4ij9C" name="usb-c-cable-lifestyle.jpg" alt="USB-C cable on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FehXB3CK2WiFJgig4ij9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not going to break down all the different specs, but here&apos;s a handy chart I borrowed from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/usb-3-2-explained">excellent explainer by Tom&apos;s Guide</a>. It sums up the USB 3.x versions very nicely, making it easy to understand each commonly used USB version and its technical specifications.</p>

<p>So now that you know a little something about the versions of USB, how do you even identify what your USB-C port&apos;s USB version is? If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll find a tiny logo indicating the variant and its data transfer speed next to the port.</p><p>Unfortunately, phones and tablets don&apos;t have such logos as identifiers. However, you can always pull out the spec sheet of your device from the brand&apos;s website or do a quick Google search to find out. For example, the latest Android flagships, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, come with USB Type-C 3.2. Since the generation isn&apos;t specified, it is understood that the Samsung and Google phones have USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 1 ports.</p>

<p>Not to point out the obvious, but you&apos;re starting to see the picture by now. USB-C is a big fluffing mess, and that&apos;s not even getting into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/usb-4-version-2-announced-80gbps">newer versions of USB4</a>. All these names, numbers, logos, and protocols are all over the place — and we haven&apos;t even reached Thunderbolt yet!</p><p>The Thunderbolt spec is a branded standard created by Intel and Apple for computing devices. A simple lightning bolt logo indicates that the USB-C port is a Thunderbolt port. We&apos;re currently at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/intel-thunderbolt-4-official-8k-display">Thunderbolt 4</a>, the latest version of the standard, which supports 40Gbps data transfer rates and uses the USB-C connector. It can handle up to 100W of power as well as up to two 4K 60Hz displays or one 8K 60Hz display on a single connection.</p><p>Thunderbolt 4 includes USB4 integration, has 100W USB PD charging, and is backward compatible with all other USB versions. Instead of trying to comprehend the version and generation of your device&apos;s USB port, this simple standard makes it so easy to know the exact data transfer speed and charging capability.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not as widely adopted just yet, but I truly believe that Thunderbolt 4 could be the best way to fix the messy situation that USB-C is in. Trying to figure out which port you have and what cable to use is no easy task. Because Thunderbolt 4 supports all other USB versions, it can be the way forward for the consumer tech industry. And that&apos;s not even getting into the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/intel-reveals-thunderbolt-5-next-generation-creators-gamers">Thunderbolt 5</a>.</p><p>In a perfect world, all computers would have Thunderbolt support because then no one would have to do hours of research trying to figure out which cable works with your device. You&apos;d just buy a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C cable and call it a day. No fumbling around with USB versions, e-markings, and all of that jazz. I would love it even more if Android phones and tablets would gain Thunderbolt support, as you wouldn&apos;t get frustrated trying to transfer data from your phone to your laptop only to find out the cable you got in the box sucks, or worse, doesn&apos;t transfer data at all.</p><p>It&apos;s been four years since Intel announced Thunderbolt 4, and I feel like we haven&apos;t been paying enough attention to it. We&apos;re starting to see more computing devices out there that tap into the full potential of this standard, although the spec feels like it&apos;s held back due to requirements, licensing, and the rivalry between Intel and Qualcomm. Thus, without widespread adoption of the standard, its advantages disappear for many. Thunderbolt has the power to unify USB-C and clear up the hot mess surrounding the port. I just don&apos;t know if we will ever see things play out this way.</p>

<ul><li>A new ad on Instagram showcases a Meta Quest 3 UI with movable windows.</li><li>These windows stay where they're put like a physical monitor.</li><li>Apple Vision Pro launched with a similar window management feature, and Meta previously teased that it was working on a big UI update for the Quest.</li><li>There's no current ETA on the new update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Apple Vision Pro launched with a revolutionary mixed reality UI that lets users place windows anywhere they want in 3D space. Vision Pro users can easily multitask between apps and windows by placing them where they make the most sense — multiple monitors on a desk, a giant TV on a wall, a floating video over the kitchen counter, etc.</p><p>Thankfully, it seems Meta has taken note and has built-in near-identical functionality into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, as shown in a mysterious new advertisement on Instagram (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@jdunrrp/post/C7fTNRSM8Kr">via jdunrrp on Threads</a>). The ad shows a mechanic wearing a Meta Quest 3, juggling multiple windows around the workshop while working on parts of a car.</p><p>The windows in the ad stay where they are in physical 3D space, just as you might expect a real monitor or display to act. This lines up with what Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">back in March</a>, but it&apos;s the first time we&apos;ve seen the feature running in action on a Meta Quest 3.</p>

<p>This feature is important for Meta as it continues to sell the Quest 3 as a mixed-reality headset, not a strictly virtual reality one. Since mixed reality mixes both virtual and actual reality together, it makes sense for the company to continue to develop ways for users to view both realities while wearing the headset.</p><p>There&apos;s no current ETA on when this new update will arrive, but it&apos;s likely that the update could be coming very soon if Meta is already advertising for it in public places like Instagram. Meta is currently testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-update-v66-beta-features">firmware update v66</a>, but that update doesn&apos;t include these features at the moment.</p><p>As the ad notes, Meta Quest 2 headsets won&apos;t have access to all the new features, almost certainly because of the headset&apos;s low resolution, black and white passthrough vision.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta about this potential new update but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cHJoQgzrWfwp4a3aFadCdP" name="windows-volumetric-apps-meta-quest-3-presentation-02.jpg" alt="Screenshots taken from a presentation of designing an Xbox controller in Creo with Windows Volumetric Apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHJoQgzrWfwp4a3aFadCdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1079" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Three major things separate the Meta Quest 3 from the Apple Vision Pro: price, performance, and display resolution. All three categories feature much higher numbers on the Apple Vision Pro, but it&apos;s clear that the Quest 3&apos;s $500 price tag is far more accessible than the $3500 price tag of the Vision Pro.</p><p>As such, we&apos;re not completely sure how well the Quest 3 will be able to handle multitasking between lots of windows at once. Currently, the Quest UI limits users to running three apps at a time, and all apps are displayed side-by-side like a triple monitor setup. App windows cannot be separated at the moment, but this new update will change that entirely.</p><p>While we wait for Meta to reveal more specifics on the update, it would be best to grab some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">BoboVR M3 Pro</a>, a head strap replacement that makes the headset <em>far</em> more comfortable to use for long periods of time.</p>

<p>In addition to free-roaming window capability, Meta has been working toward attracting more developers to create 2D apps for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Horizon OS</a>, the operating system that Meta Quest headsets run. Unfortunately, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">the relationship between Meta and Google</a>, there&apos;s little likelihood that we&apos;ll see the Google Play Store on Meta Quest headsets anytime soon.</p><p>Meta is currently working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2-new-display-delay">Meta Quest Pro 2 with LG</a>, which is expected to debut sometime in 2027, meaning the company has plenty of time to get developers onboard with making 2D apps before it tries to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">number of apps on Vision Pro</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-volumetric-apps-meta-quest-3">Volumetric Apps</a> will be coming to Windows by way of Meta Quest headsets, and it&apos;s entirely possible that this ad is referencing some of that functionality in addition to the Quest 3 UI update.</p>

<ul><li>Acer, ASUS, and HP have all announced a total of six new Chromebooks.</li><li>These include five Chromebook Plus models and even a ChromeOS tablet.</li><li>Pricing for the various devices starts at $299 for the ASUS Chromebook CM30 and goes up to $699 for the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714.</li></ul>
<p>We&apos;ve been wondering where all of the new Chromebooks have been hiding, as there haven&apos;t been many new devices hitting the store shelves. Well, the wait is now over, as Acer, ASUS, and HP are announcing six new options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="a2b4ozDBNap6d787adi557" name="acer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-intel-core-ultra-promo.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 Intel Core Ultra promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a2b4ozDBNap6d787adi557.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Acer)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting off with Acer, the company is updating two of its best offerings, including the Chromebook Plus moniker. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 features the same great 2-in-1 design and build quality that we&apos;ve come to know and love. However, along with a slight name change, it&apos;s also one of the first Chromebooks to be powered by Intel&apos;s Core Ultra processor.</p><p>Last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Spin 714</a> has largely remained atop the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>, and we&apos;re hoping that trend continues. Along with the Intel Core Ultra 5, the Chromebook Plus Spin 714 sports a 14-inch touchscreen display, a 1440p QHD webcam, and plenty of port selection.</p>

<p>When it comes to big screen Chromebooks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-516-ge-review">Acer Chromebook 516 GE</a> was easily one of our favorites. Even with the gamer aesthetic, this was a powerhouse of a machine, and now, the Chromebook Plus 516 GE is here. It too continues to include many of the same design choices and features that helped make its predecessor so popular.</p><p>It&apos;s still the perfect Chromebook for cloud gaming, thanks to the beautiful 16-inch, 2560x1600, 120Hz, display. While Acer opted against using the latest Intel Core Ultra series of chips, the Chromebook Plus 516 GE is no slouch as it instead is powered by Intel&apos;s 13th Gen. Both of these Chromebooks will be available this month, with prices coming in at either $699 or $749.</p>

<p>ASUS is next up, and is coming in hot with two new Chromebooks of its own. The Chromebook Plus CX34 is the company&apos;s flagship option for those wanting a traditional 14-inch Chromebook. It&apos;s powered by the 13th Gen Intel Core i5, and can be configured with, or without, a touchscreen.</p>

<p>One could argue that the show&apos;s star is the Chromebook CM30, bringing us the first ChromeOS-powered tablet for consumers since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Lenovo&apos;s Chromebook Duet 3</a>. The CM30 is bundled with a magnetic stand cover and keyboard, making it easy to go from sending an email to playing a game in a snap. There&apos;s also a garaged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a>, which is great for jotting down notes or using the CM30 as a drawing tablet.</p>

<p>There&apos;s one more entry coming from the ASUS camp, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/asus-expertbook-cx54-chromebook-plus-first-look" target="_blank">ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus</a> is finally available. This debuted at the beginning of the year, as it was the first Chromebook to be announced using Intel&apos;s Core Ultra processors. However, it still hasn&apos;t been available for purchase, but that&apos;s no longer an issue.</p><p>Currently, there&apos;s only one configuration available, which includes the Intel Core Ultra 5 SoC, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Priced at $799, the only place you can get the CX54 Chromebook Plus is from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.asus.com/us/90nx0791-m00620-asus-expertbook-cx54-chromebook-plus-enterprise-cx5403.html" target="_blank">ASUS directly</a>. We hope to not only get our hands on one, but also that it makes its way to more retailers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hMAoPL5PbEXvYTeqb2HwcL" name="hp-chromebook-14-promo-hero-1.jpg" alt="HP Chromebook 14 on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMAoPL5PbEXvYTeqb2HwcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HP)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out the pack are a couple of Chromebooks from HP. While we don&apos;t yet have a successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a>, HP isn&apos;t just sitting around with nothing new to show off. The company&apos;s popular 2-in-1 is now called the HP Chromebook Plus x360, while still sporting a 14-inch touchscreen display. And while it won&apos;t blow your socks off in the performance department, the x360 makes up for it with a long-lasting battery and HP Fast Charge.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the HP Chromebook 14, which we already expect to be one of the best student Chromebooks with its $249 price tag. As the name implies, it sports a 14-inch display, complete with a 1920 x 1080 resolution and a 1080p webcam "enhanced by Temporal Noise Reduction." This, too, is expected to be a battery champ as HP rates it to last for more than 12 hours on a single charge.</p>

<ul><li>Google has announced a slew of new AI and Gemini powered features for Chromebooks.</li><li>These include things such as Help Me Write, Generative AI Wallpaper, and Magic Editor in Google Photos.</li><li>Gemini is also finally coming to Chromebook Plus devices, complete with a dedicated icon on the app shelf.</li><li>Compatible Chromebook Plus models will receive these new features "over the next week or so."</li></ul>
<p>While we have been focused on the never-ending slog of AI features coming to phones, things have largely been quiet on the Chromebook front. Thankfully, the fun is now coming to Chromebook Plus devices, as Google has announced an impressive number of changes.</p><p>Getting things started, Google is bringing AI to Chromebooks through features like Help Me Write, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">Generative AI Wallpaper</a> and Video Call Backgrounds, and Magic Editor on Google Photos. None of this should come as much of a surprise, as they are the same features that have already been available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6869px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="26YqBj2DeJb3dNb9NAPvaC" name="magic-editor-chromebook-render.jpeg" alt="Magic Editor for Chromebooks render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/26YqBj2DeJb3dNb9NAPvaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6869" height="3864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s cool being able to use AI to create fun and unique wallpapers, or help you to rewrite an email to sound a bit more formal. But, seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> come to Chromebooks is rather surprising. Magic Editor was first introduced on the Pixel 8 series, letting you move subjects around, and let AI help you decide what other edits can be made. The best part of this is that it&apos;s coming to the Google Photos app without needing to jump through any hoops.</p><p>Another surprising change is that you&apos;ll now be able to sign in and set up your new Chromebook with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Just scan the QR code when it appears on the screen, provide authentication, and your devices will do the rest. This includes signing into your Wi-Fi network and logging into your Google account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dwwmd3hQgGVdjiKkkvNgXB" name="quick-start-with-android-chromebooks.jpeg" alt="Quick Start with Android on Chromebooks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dwwmd3hQgGVdjiKkkvNgXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those who enjoy gaming on Chromebooks will also want to install this update as soon as it&apos;s made available. There&apos;s a new "Game Dashboard," designed to take the frustration out of trying to play the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> using a keyboard.</p><p>However, it&apos;s not <em>just</em> for mapping controls, as the Game Dashboard menu also makes it easy to record your screen or take a screenshot without skipping a beat. We can expect to see many more new features coming soon to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>, such as quickly accessing Google Tasks and being able to create GIFs using the built-in screen capture tool.</p>

<p>Arguably, the biggest update coming to Chromebooks is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. Once the latest update is installed, a new Gemini app will appear right on the app shelf. We aren&apos;t yet sure whether Google plans to eventually use this to replace Google Assistant, but it definitely feels like a step in that direction.</p><p>To go along with today&apos;s launch of new Chromebook Plus models, Google is throwing in a pretty good perk. Google One AI Premium is now being included with new Chromebook Plus models for 12 months. With this, you&apos;ll get 2TB of storage, access to Gemini across various Google services, and Gemini Advanced.</p>

<p>Although ChromeOS didn&apos;t get any stage time during Google I/O 2024, our own Nick Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/youll-soon-be-able-to-control-chromebooks-with-just-your-face">caught a glimpse</a> of an upcoming feature. One of which, was confirmed as part of features Google is expecting to ship "in the coming year."</p><p>Soon, you&apos;ll be able to control your Chromebook hands-free, using face and gesture tracking. This is an evolution of Project Gameface, which first debuted at Google I/O 2023, aiming to provide a way to "control a computer&apos;s cursor using their head movement and facial gestures."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Google didn&apos;t provide much in the way of specifics, other than to let us know that this capability is coming to Chromebooks. However, you can head over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google/project-gameface" target="_blank">Project Gameface Github</a> to learn more.</p><p>The headlining features, such as Magic Editor and Help Me Write, are slated to arrive on Chromebook Plus models. Meanwhile, all Chromebook owners will soon enjoy the other features, including using your Android phone to set up your Chromebook. All the new features Google has announced are starting to roll out and will arrive "through an automatic update over the next week or so."</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-march-camera-update">released a major camera-focused update in March</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series, but a new rumor says an even bigger one is on the way.</p><p>Leaker Ice Universe says that One UI 6.1.1 is being developed for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and promises to be the biggest update since the series saw daylight. This update is expected to bring a bunch of camera improvements, which may appease some users who feel the current camera performance needs a boost.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra boasts impressive hardware and a versatile camera setup, but its imaging performance is hit-or-miss and falls short compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">leading camera phones</a>.</p><p>The leaker claims that the upcoming software update will bring "a lot of camera updates," potentially resolving several issues. Over at Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/galaxy-s24-disappointing-camera/td-p/9196933" target="_blank">community pages</a>, users have reported problems like inconsistent long-range zoom quality, shutter lag, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/motion-blur-shutter-lag-speed/td-p/9406189" target="_blank">motion blur</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/S24-Ultra-overexposed-photos/td-p/15417060" target="_blank">overexposure in certain parts of the frame</a>, among others.</p><p>Despite several updates since its launch, the phone&apos;s camera performance hasn&apos;t improved significantly. Samsung initially planned a major camera update for April, but Ice Universe later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-upgrade-might-be-on-hold-for-a-bit">reported that it was postponed until June</a>. It now seems these improvements might be included in One UI 6.1.1.</p><p>The firmware is still in its early development stages and will undergo extensive testing before being released to the public. Typically, One UI x.1.1 updates first appear on Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> before rolling out to older models.</p><p>As per the leaker, One UI 6.1.1 will debut with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, set to launch in July at an event in Paris. This suggests the Galaxy S24’s major camera update should arrive shortly after.</p>
