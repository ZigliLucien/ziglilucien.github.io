Consumers will notice that this year's Echo products have received a complete redesign. Starting with the first-ever Echo Dot Max, Amazon states this new device brings roughly three times more bass compared to its previous Echo Dot 5th Gen.</p><p>This product has received a two-way speaker system with a "high-excursion" woofer for deeper bass and crispy highs. While this compact speaker still embodies what Amazon intends for the Echo Dot series (now in Max), there's a lot inside that consumers don't see, which is pushing it further ahead.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="eCD44cpXocRk4ytgND2JWJ" name="amazon-echo-dot-max-render" alt="The Amazon Echo Dot Max is the first of its kind for the company, bringing in a more conversational Alexa experience, richer sounds, and better microphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eCD44cpXocRk4ytgND2JWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1065" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internally, the Echo Dot Max, like the rest of the newly launched products, features Amazon's custom silicon chip. For the Max specifically, the post states it features the new AZ3 chip for "better conversation detection." This chip pushes the Dot Max to sift out background noise, so your natural conversations with Alexa Plus remain crystal clear.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">Alexa Plus</a> is there for whatever your query is, Amazon announced that preparing to launch the Alexa Plus Store. Users can manage their Amazon subscriptions from this store, and "explore, discover, and enable devices and services" from TaskRabbit, Fandango, Priceline, Uber, Lyft, and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6SZKGT4?ref=ods_surl_edm_us">Amazon Echo Dot Max</a> starts at $99.99, and pre-orders are available ahead of its October 29 rollout.</p><h2 id="echo-studio-shines-again-2">Echo Studio shines again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:369px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:162.60%;"><img id="RMpoPjpHosTqmCRT3k9te9" name="amazon-echo-studio-2025-render" alt="The new 2025 Echo Studio adopts a round design with a knit-fabric exterior to empower its deeper bass and rich sounds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMpoPjpHosTqmCRT3k9te9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="369" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year's Echo Studio already made headlines over the previous iteration, as consumers will find it ~40% smaller than before. Amazon states it's trying to balance a device that fits seamlessly into your living space, while also providing rich, powerful sound, no matter where you put it in the room.</p><p>It offers the same woofer as the Dot Max; however, its specifications mention that the Echo Studio also supports spatial audio and Dolby Atmos. The newest Studio really zeroes in on delivering immersive sounds for homeowners, as it sports a spherical design this time with a knit-fabric covering, which Amazon says contributes to its "ultimate acoustic transparency."</p><p>Inside the Studio, Amazon placed its custom AZ3 Pro chip, which takes the audio capabilities of the standard AZ3 even higher.</p><p>The audio potential for the Echo Studio strives for new heights when paired with other Studio devices or the new Dot Max (up to five). When connected to a "compatible" Fire TV Stick, users can activate Alexa Home Theater and let the AI facilitate that cinema-quality sound you're looking for. Amazon states consumers will also find these products in its Alexa Home Theater bundles.</p><p>The Echo Studio starts at $219, and its pre-orders are live (November 15 rollout).</p><h2 id="putting-on-a-echo-show-2">Putting on a (Echo) Show</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="uowSrQpqjCtLCaZDJGebKE" name="amazon-echo-show-8-11-render" alt="The new Amazon Echo Show 8 and 11 offers varying display sizes, new screens, more information, and an enhanced Alexa Plus experience for any task." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uowSrQpqjCtLCaZDJGebKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon's Echo Show models feature a screen, which only enhances the smart home experience, but this year's pair, the Show 8 and 11, are looking to do more with AI. The post highlights the Show 8 and 11's in-cell touch and "negative liquid crystal design" for an improved visual screen experience. Inside, the AZ3 Pro chip is there, as well as Amazon's Omnisense technology.</p><p>Leveraging the Show 8 and 11's 13MP camera, Omnisense delivers a new world of ambient AI, as the devices can act depending on what's happening in your home. If you've set a reminder for someone and that person happens to walk by, the Show 8 and 11 will show it to them. Alexa is also said to "greet you" when you walk up to these newest Show models.</p><p>The upgraded screens for the Show 8 and 11 give users even more information when Alexa surfaces their favorite content.</p><p>For entertainment, Amazon says these models sport a new "media control center" for browsing music, podcasts, and books in their own dedicated places. Alexa Plus adds a Shopping widget, which monitors and tracks your deliveries and more from Amazon, Whole Foods, and Amazon Fresh. Tapping the display or asking Alexa to surface details about your orders is possible. Alexa is even there, ready to answer questions about gift recommendations for people.</p><p>There's a notable update with the Show 8 and 11's Health & Wellness features, and that's the inclusion of Oura. Amazon states that it's working with Oura, enabling users to connect their accounts, so Alexa can provide "personalized suggestions like getting in a quick workout based on your schedule." Home Organization helps users manage calendar schedules, while Alexa Plus Home is your one-stop shop for everything smart home, like your Ring camera feeds.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a.co/d/dhN3XZt">Echo Show 8</a> starts at $179, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a.co/d/iVhFMyL">Show 11</a> runs for $219.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We recently got our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-leak">first look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>, and now another leak suggests Samsung may release a Galaxy S26 Plus model alongside the rest of the series.</p><p>From the start, rumors about the Galaxy S26 lineup hinted at changes from the Galaxy S25 generation. Reports suggested Samsung would replace the $1,000 'Plus' model with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leaked-galaxy-s26-edge-cad-renders-reveal-its-peculiar-design">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> and rename the base version to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-design-leaks-hint-at-changes-ahead-for-flagship-lineup">Galaxy S26 Pro</a>, while keeping the Galaxy S26 Ultra as the top-tier option.</p><p>It now appears, however, that Samsung may release the Galaxy S26 Plus after all.</p><h2 id="samsung-may-not-be-done-with-the-galaxy-s26-plus-2">Samsung may not be done with the Galaxy S26 Plus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-03" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to a new report from Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=41727">The Elec</a>, Samsung has begun development of a device codenamed “M Plus,” which is believed to be the Galaxy S26+. The company initially planned to launch only the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra, but with sluggish Galaxy S25 Edge sales, it seems Samsung has revived development of the Plus model.</p><p>If accurate, this would mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 lineup</a> could once again include four models. For comparison, Samsung planned production of about 300,000 Galaxy S25 Edge units between September and December 2025, while producing nearly 500,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> units in the same timeframe — even though the Plus itself has sold less impressively than the standard Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Still, it looks like Samsung is reconsidering its strategy for the Galaxy S26 lineup. The Galaxy S26 Plus could be a valuable option for users who don't want the slim design of the Galaxy S26 Edge but still want a large display and telephoto lens. And in the end, more competition is always better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This component is designed specifically for the math and data handling required by artificial intelligence and machine learning models, making it significantly different from standard phone hardware, such as the CPU and standard GPU.</p><p>It works with the "normal" phone hardware to transform lines of code into something that appears to think or be intelligent. It's also <em>very</em> different.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Feature</p></th><th  ><p>NPU</p></th><th  ><p>Standard CPU or GPU</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Primary Function: </strong></p></td><td  ><p>Optimized for neural network computation, machine learning, and deep learning tasks like matrix multiplications or convolutions.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Handles general-purpose, sequential tasks.</p><p><strong>GPU:</strong> Handles graphics rendering and massive, but simple, parallel computations.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Architecture: </strong></p></td><td  ><p>Built for massively parallel processing of low-precision 8-bit or 16-bit arithmetic.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Optimized for complex instructions at a high clock with and low latency.</p><p><strong>GPU:</strong> Optimized for 32-bit floating-point math common in graphics.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Extremely power-efficient for AI tasks, allowing complex AI (like real-time translation or image generation) to run on the battery for longer.</p></td><td  ><p><strong>CPU/GPU:</strong> Can run AI tasks, but are significantly less power-efficient and slower than an NPU for the same task, draining the battery much faster while taking longer to do it.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Performance Measurement: </strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>TOPS</strong> (Tera Operations Per Second).

Without one, AI processing on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> (or any device, for that matter) will be significantly slower, consume more battery, and likely require an internet connection and a remote AI server to function. Chip makers have their own brand of NPU: Google has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor Core</a>, Apple has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">Neural Engine</a>, Qualcomm has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Hexagon NPU</a>, and so on. They all do the same things slightly differently.</p><p>However, you also need standard phone hardware to bring everything together and enable faster and more efficient AI processing.</p><p>The CPU manages and coordinates the entire system. For AI, it handles the initial setup of the data pipeline, and for some smaller, simpler models, it may execute the AI task itself, albeit less efficiently than the NPU.</p><p>The GPU can accelerate some AI tasks, especially those related to image and video processing, as its parallel architecture is well-suited for repetitive, simple calculations. In a <strong>heterogeneous architecture</strong> (utilizing multiple processor components on a single chip), the system can select the most suitable component (NPU, GPU, or CPU) for a specific AI workload.</p><p>AI models, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">large language models</a> (LLMs) used for generative AI, require a large amount of fast RAM (Random Access Memory) to store the entire model and the data it's actively processing. Modern flagship phones have increased RAM to support these larger, more capable on-device AI models.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For fast and efficient AI ("good" AI is subjective), what you really need is optimization.

Despite my hoard of options, I've ended up sticking with Garmin's most unique watch of the year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, for hundreds of miles of marathon training.</p><p>Long-time Garmin fans looked askance at the eight-day battery life and squircle design, but I found myself instantly accustomed to its feathery, comfortable fit and the ultra-bright 2-inch display for seeing data more clearly at a glance during workouts. The only thing that truly made it hard to recommend was the high price tag.</p><p>Now that Garmin has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C"><strong>discounted the Venu X1 by $100</strong></a> for its birthday sale, it's a more reasonable upgrade to the new $549 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3">Venu 4</a>, and anyone sick of Garmin watches' bulky aesthetic should give it serious consideration.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3" name="garmin-venu-x1-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Garmin Venu X1 has an Apple Watch Ultra-esque look but weighs a full ounce less and lasts over a week instead of a couple of days. It has the software tools of a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99">Forerunner 970</a> — from training load and running tolerance to real-time stamina and hiking/ golf maps — but again, you'll barely notice it on your wrist until you need information.</p><p>Even at $100 off, it's still expensive for a smartwatch. But it may be a <em>long</em> time before we see a better deal on such a new model, and it'll save you hundreds compared to a bulky <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Smartwatch-Advanced-Features-ComfortFit/dp/B0FCYHNL3C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Forerunner 970" data-dimension48="Forerunner 970" data-dimension25="$699.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You already know the Garmin ecosystem well enough to drop serious cash on <em>any</em> premium model; you're a self-guided athlete who wants Garmin's best training insights; and you care about comfort and eye strain as much as battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You can't responsibly spend this much on any smartwatch; you need a Fenix or Instinct that'll last for a 100-mile race or multi-day hike; or you don't work out enough to take full advantage of Garmin's tools.</p><p>Out of all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, you'll rarely find one this light; those that are, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>, have tiny displays and much more limited features. Because the Venu X1 display doesn't cut off its corners for a traditional rounded look, you get much more topographical detail on maps, with more room for buttons and menus that don't block your view. And otherwise, your watch faces and widgets are much larger, fitting more details on the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the Venu X1 isn't perfect, and you may end up deciding that you'd rather buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-makes-major-changes-to-garmins-health-and-fitness-coaching-and-were-intrigued">Venu 4</a> at full price for about $150 less.</p><p>The Venu 4 may not have maps, sapphire crystal protection, or premium running and cycling tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> or Hill/ Endurance scores. But it does beat the Venu X1 with dual-band GPS and ECG readings, along with an extra 2–4 days of battery life. And it offers the same mic & speaker, flashlight, and training load data.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that the Venu 4 45mm weighs about half an ounce more while showing less data. It's still lighter than your typical smartwatch, and everyday Garmin fans probably won't mind. It's just missing that special something that makes the X1 stand out for me.</p><p>Only you know whether the Venu X1 is the right metaphorical fit for your daily workouts. All I can tell you is that the <em>physical</em> fit is fantastic and you can't pry the Garmin Venu X1 off my wrist.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Likewise, your Galaxy or Pixel Watch has the new appeal of constant Gemini access on your wrist. Now that I've tested both, I wanted to do a quick, candid breakdown of what each experience offers and which will be more useful to you.</p><p>I'm <em>not</em> comparing smartwatches and smart glasses' general value, nor trying to say whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI</a> is "smarter." Both LLMs have their weaknesses and hallucinations, and I won't stir up controversy over brand loyalties.</p><p>This is very specifically about whether Meta's camera-based, hands-free AI in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a> glasses — and upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> — is better positioned to help you than an always-listening Gemini on your wrist.</p><h2 id="what-meta-ai-on-ray-ban-and-oakley-glasses-can-and-can-t-do-2">What Meta AI on Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses can and can't do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jeoNejAeVxk9e9s8Fm9bn" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-close-up-with-case" alt="Close-up photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses sitting folded up on an armrest with the official brown Ray-Ban charging case behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeoNejAeVxk9e9s8Fm9bn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Meta AI can:</strong></p><ul><li>Offer general Llama 4-based information with LLM-generated answers</li><li>Use multimodal AI to interpret an image from your camera, then answer a question or remember information.</li><li>Live translate between French, Italian, Spanish, and English speakers</li><li>Use Live AI for extended conversations with no wake words</li><li>Sync with Android/iOS phone and messaging apps, plus a few others (Spotify, Audible, Instagram, Google Calendar, etc.)</li></ul><p>Meta wants to eventually offer "contextual AI" that records and interprets everything you see throughout the day, automatically remembering who you've spoken to, where you've parked, what you've eaten, and so on. All the AI processing would need to be done <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> to forestall the obvious privacy concerns, and it would need to be incredibly efficient.</p><p>For now, Live AI is Meta's closest equivalent, and it consumes about 1.5% of my Ray-Ban Gen 2 capacity per minute of use, on pace for an hour total. Still, it has serious potential, especially for helping the visually impaired navigate and interpret their surroundings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-inspecting-01" alt="Inspecting the inside of transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses before putting them on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWYNvJk5f4nEWRdiVSsa3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> glasses pull answers to your questions from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-is-coming-for-google-and-openai-with-its-fresh-llama-4-models">Llama 4</a> model in the Meta AI companion app. In my testing, the multimodal AI identified plants or landmarks with decent accuracy.</p><p>My favorite moment was using my glasses in Barnes & Noble to get summaries and review data about books with cool covers, with my phone in my pocket.</p><p>In its worst moments, Meta AI tells me it can't answer my questions or answers confidently with incorrect information.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-recipe-tomato" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing a Meta AI prompt about a tomato recipe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the usual LLM hallucinations, the main problem is that you don't have a viewfinder, so you can't tell if you're close enough (or too close) to your subject.

Meta AI has a surprisingly robust list of connections, most notably your iOS or Android calling and messaging apps. But Gemini offers email summaries, smart home controls, Maps reviews, and better communication <em>between</em> apps, like pasting Search results into a message or a Keep reminder.</p><h2 id="neither-is-the-perfect-form-for-ai-2">Neither is the 'perfect' form for AI</h2><p>Gemini on Wear OS provides you with AI insights, offering better battery life, comfort, and power than smart glasses can reasonably provide. It gives you better tools for using or responding to your AI data, but its multimodal capabilities will always be limited.</p><p>Meta AI on Ray-Ban or Oakley glasses can pull real-time data from what you're seeing and hearing in a very natural way. However, the hardware has a long way to go, and you may encounter more pushback from wearing cameras on your face.</p><p>Both of these AI form factors overlap, but I think they're specialized (and limited) enough that neither will be the <em>definitive</em> way to use AI anytime soon. Heck, I'm sure many people will continue to use their phones' AI apps. But it should be exciting to watch both new AI form factors improve with time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not hyperbole to say this is a game-changer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1idr6j6/call_screening_is_a_game_changer/">as so many</a> Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ggsaer/ai_call_screening_is_very_underrated/">users point out</a>.</p><p>Since its inception, Google has expanded these capabilities to include caller ID and spam filtering, scam detection, call screening, voice translation, and features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a>, Take a Message, Hold for Me, Direct My Call, and Audio Emojis. Samsung and a few other OEMs offer similar features, but no one actually <em>filters</em> spam better than a Pixel phone, and it's still one of the best reasons to buy one.</p><h2 id="camera-motion-capture-2">Camera motion capture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dqrKjKJuM3sUC9FFTRAbQW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-back-taking-a-photo" alt="Taking a photo with a porcelain Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dqrKjKJuM3sUC9FFTRAbQW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pro Res Zoom and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a> might have been the big new features for this year's Pixel 10 camera, but once again, it's a faithful old feature that I find to be the most useful. I'm talking about Frequent Faces, a feature you need to enable in the camera settings and one that ensures pictures of your favorite people and pets come out crisp every time.</p><p>Frequent Faces builds upon what Google built in Google Photos many years ago. Your Pixel will recognize the faces of people and pets you most often take photos of and locally store that data for reference. When you take future photos of these people or pets, the Pixel camera software understands that these faces should be prioritized in the shot.</p><p>This lets you capture a crisp photo of your 2-year-old while they're running around in the evening, whereas other phones might just capture a blurry image. It's yet another passive AI-based capability that I find incredibly useful on Pixel phones, and something no other phone can do.</p><h2 id="pixel-recorder-2">Pixel Recorder</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MfAcxVgjatpbQ5JwPPWSVW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pixel-recorder-singing" alt="Recording myself singing on the Google Recorder app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfAcxVgjatpbQ5JwPPWSVW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the dedicated Pixel apps on the phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-pixel-recorder-app">Pixel Recorder</a> is my most used. It's no surprise, given my profession — journalism requires a lot of recording, logging, and note-taking — and Pixel Recorder has been one of my all-time favorite apps since its launch on the Pixel 4.</p><p>Many phones have built-in audio recorders that can transcribe the audio, but the Pixel's is still the best for several reasons. First, transcription quality is better than any other phone or app I've tried. Even services like Otter don't perform quite as well, and all of these transcriptions happen <em>locally</em> on your phone. Plus, the recordings and transcripts are automatically backed up to your Google account.</p><p>Speaker labels are automatically created, and you can quickly thumb through the automatically-generated summary or search for anything in the recording that you want to find. Plus, Pixel 10 updates add music generation capabilities, so if you're someone who often catches a tune playing in their head and wants to turn it into a legit song, Pixel Recorder can help you do that.</p><h2 id="pixel-screenshots-2">Pixel Screenshots</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L2RZdXEgB35fu4c9sB6tbW" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pixel-screenshots" alt="Organizing screenshots with the Pixel Screenshots app on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2RZdXEgB35fu4c9sB6tbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm someone who takes <em>a lot</em> of screenshots.

DJI is probably the most famous name in this segment, but other brands like Hohem, Joby, and OBSBOT do pretty well for themselves, too.</p><p>Hohem just launched a new AI-ready gimbal that has two of the best features seen in DJI gimbals — AI tracking and advanced remote controls. The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra doesn't just offer your average run-of-the-mill person tracking features, though. It takes things to the next level.</p><p>As for the detachable remote, it has a touchscreen with a joystick and two buttons. The touchscreen remote shows the live feed from the AI camera. It attaches to the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal magnetically, charging wirelessly while docked.</p><p>I spent a good few weeks trying out the iSteady V3 Ultra with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and various other phones, and I truly believe this is the future of all premium-grade gimbals going forward.</p><h2 id="the-hohem-isteady-v3-ultra-gimbal-has-an-advanced-ai-tracker-with-gestures-for-several-commands-2">The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal has an advanced AI-tracker with gestures for several commands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gYzoByAtsBpshWkyzTXUY7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-18" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYzoByAtsBpshWkyzTXUY7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2027" height="1140" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The little white rectangle is the AI module of the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The AI-tracker on the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal is probably the most complex one on the market. The AI module has a flashlight and a 2MP camera lens, and it can be detached and manually turned on or off. You can detach and reattach it to be front or rear facing, depending on which camera you're using to shoot photos or videos in the moment. The flashlight has three color modes: 6500K (Cool light), 5000K (Neutral light), and 2700K (Warm light).</p><p>You can track people, pets, and even objects with the AI tracker. This can be done automatically or manually through the touchscreen remote, by dragging to select the subject on the tiny screen. Once the target is locked in, the gimbal smoothly swivels and tilts to keep it in view. Since the gimbal has a three-axis stabilization design, even if you walk or run while shooting a video of the subject being tracked, the movements are extremely smooth and stable.</p><p>I did face some issues when the object being tracked disappeared from view completely; the gimbal goes berserk trying to find its target. There's a learning curve to it that takes a few tries and experimentation to figure out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hjyc7YHyRG7vUUVMbJfey7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-1" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hjyc7YHyRG7vUUVMbJfey7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gestures are the highlight of the iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal's AI features. You can use hand gestures to command the iSteady V3 Ultra to change orientation. For instance, pointing upwards with both hands while it's looking at you, even while recording, immediately changes the orientation from landscape to portrait.</p><p>Other gesture commands apart from changing orientation include starting or stopping AI tracking, capturing a photo, initiating or finishing video recording, and customizing your camera composition. This allows the gimbal to track your movements, rotating up to 360 degrees, without you being in the center of the camera's viewpoint. For example, you could choose to place the object being tracked as per the rule of thirds.</p><p>Of all these features, I struggled to get the camera composition feature to work most times. The rest work well; however, none of them are as effective in darker lighting. The AI camera struggles to recognize the shape your hands form without sufficient light. There is also a proximity limit, requiring you to be between 0.5m and 5m away for gesture recognition.</p><h2 id="the-setup-process-is-as-straightforward-as-it-can-be-2">The setup process is as straightforward as it can be</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjXkKtECRv7vVZ28w3nQC8" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-15" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjXkKtECRv7vVZ28w3nQC8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n6mxTtj5zs8sfMJzhLrv98" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-17" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6mxTtj5zs8sfMJzhLrv98.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dFoyVcVtMotU9Wk2NGRh88" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-16" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFoyVcVtMotU9Wk2NGRh88.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Setting up the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal is not difficult.

Even the little legs tucked into the base of the gimbal are extremely stable and feel durable.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WxNutuLd7TpoBr58zAWEr7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-13" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WxNutuLd7TpoBr58zAWEr7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B3EGnw5RafvCF4bzo4nfo7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-14" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3EGnw5RafvCF4bzo4nfo7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="g5ipDjQkwvtW7Rv5vijEk7" name="Hohem-iSteady-V3-Ultra-lifestyle-11" alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5ipDjQkwvtW7Rv5vijEk7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3542" height="1993" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There's a standard quarter-inch tripod thread at the base of the iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal, so you can screw it into any tripod if the built-in 8-inch extension pole isn't long enough for you.</p><p>Hohem delivers a nine-hour uptime from the gimbal's 1,600mAh battery. Constantly using the AI module and the flashlight significantly dips this uptime, though I found that the flashlight is the main culprit here.

DJI has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-6941565997517-Osmo-Mobile-Gimbal/dp/B07FTG84SW" target="_blank">Osmo Mobile 7P</a> priced at $149, which comes close, but its detachable remote does not have a touchscreen with a live camera feed on it.</p><p>There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OBSBOT-AI-Powered-Auto-Tracking-Wide-Angle-Streaming/dp/B099WYPVHF/">OBSBOT Me</a>, an AI-powered gimbal that tracks the subject. It also has gesture controls, but there's no remote control. Yet, the OBSBOT Me gimbal still costs a whopping $144.</p><p>Having used gimbals from all three brands, I can say that they match the same level of quality and function. All three gimbals are fabulous for content capture and creation. While DJI has the smoothest performance, it lacks the live feed feature of the remote and templates offered by the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra gimbal.</p><p>While the Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra is not perfect just yet, this gimbal perfectly illustrates how AI is transforming all sorts of products in consumer tech, not just phones and smart home equipment. For $169, this is an outstanding product that matches the needs of various media professionals and amateurs alike. I especially recommend this to beginners who are not yet experienced enough to invest in more advanced gear.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f94c18ff-994f-4896-bd2d-8c3162644475">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzbPBUsUVhQEs7yG9djDRR.jpg' alt="Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future of gimbals?</strong></em></p><p>The Hohem iSteady V3 Ultra is a unique gimbal that uses AI tracking to keep your phone's camera in frame and to change the camera orientation via gestures.

Here in October, Google's kicking off the spooky month by introducing Gemini for Home, a new range of smart home devices with its AI model woven directly into the core of every single product. These new cameras, a Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd Gen), and a Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen), offer an experience you'll find familiar, but greatly enhanced by upgraded hardware and Gemini.</p><p>Internally, Gemini's at the heart, and Google says you'll find new capabilities thanks to its multimodal software, like more detailed alerts from home.</p><p>The press release states users will "get the full picture" behind every alert and "see important moments up close with a zoomed-in video preview." In the app, users will find that they're scrolling less through their video history. Leveraging "Ask Home," users can ask the AI a specific question like, "What happened to the vase in the living room?" Google states the AI will produce a description of what happened, as well as a video for proof.</p><p>Additionally, within the app's Home Brief, users will receive a summary of every event that may have happened while they were away without hopping from video to video.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf" name="google-nest-gemini-doorbell-hazel" alt="The new Google Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen) in hazel up against a door." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.43%;"><img id="AAMvEAZQs3mFiLadcrnsAf" name="google-home-nest-outdoor-camera-hazel-wall-mounted-side" alt="The new Google Nest Outdoor camera, mounted on a wall in its hazel color option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AAMvEAZQs3mFiLadcrnsAf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="840" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On a hardware level,  Google states all three cameras have been upgraded with 2K HDR video capabilities. Joining that is a wider, taller aspect ratio for videos. The post states the new Nest Cams grab 152-degree diagonal viewing, while the Doorbell sees an upgraded 1:1 aspect ratio and 166-degree diagonal viewing, giving homeowners a much fuller picture of anything going on in or around their home.</p><p>Lastly, Google states it's improved the low-light performance, so users will find richer colors and details in darker scenarios.</p><p>User privacy is a big deal, especially for cameras that are so personal. Google states the newest cameras have their videos encrypted, and there's two-step verification using your Google Account. Moreover, users will notice a green light on their cameras, informing them when it's processing or streaming video.</p><p>Without worrying about a subscription, Google states the newest Nest cameras provide a zoom and crop-out feature, so you can focus on what matters in any given event. The built-in "intelligent alerts" for identifying people, vehicles, animals, and more are included without extra cost (a subscription). What's more, homeowners receive "video history included," meaning you can go back and see what's going on from six hours ago, instead of three.</p><p>The new Nest Cams and Doorbell are launching today (Oct 1) on the Google Store and "major retailers." In Snow, Hazel, and Berry, the Nest Cam Indoor starts at $99.99. Available in Snow and Hazel, the Nest Cam Outdoor starts at $149.99. Finally, debuting in Snow, hazel, and Linen, the new Nest Doorbell starts at $179.99.</p><p>The Indoor and Outdoor cams will hit markets in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The Doorbell will only arrive in the U.S. and Canada, presumably, for now.</p><h2 id="a-conversational-google-home-speaker-2">A conversational Google Home Speaker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.27%;"><img id="NPioYGGXQqEC3DL7QqJntA" name="google-home-gemini-speaker-black-kitchen-example" alt="The new Google Home Speaker in black, sitting on a counter top with a model standing beside it, holding a mug." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPioYGGXQqEC3DL7QqJntA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="712" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That new Nest Indoor camera isn't the only product arriving with Gemini for your home. Truly surging ahead in the "Gemini for Home" era is the new Google Home Speaker that's reportedly "engineered for Gemini." At its core, Gemini is what makes this Speaker, as the post states, the product is designed for "natural conversations." The new Home Speaker has been outfitted with "custom processing" to handle any task you give it with fluidity.</p><p>Rounding its rounder design is a circular ring light right beneath it. Google says this light is there for visual feedback, so you know when Gemini is listening, "reasoning," responding to your question, or in "Gemini Live Mode."</p><p>Consumers will find the new Speaker produces 360-degree audio and a long-requested feature: the ability to pair two Google Home Speakers with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>. Google teases that users can use two Speakers can turn their living spaces into a little home theater, if they'd like. Existing features, such as grouping multiple Nest speakers for multi-room music enjoyment, remain.</p><p>Users can physically mute the Google Home Speaker with its mic toggle on its frame.</p><p>The Google Home Speaker will debut in Porcelain, Hazel, Jade, and Berry. However, consumers will not see this product launch with the other Nest cameras previously highlighted. Google states that it wants to roll out Gemini for Home in early access for its device ecosystem <em>before </em>introducing the next big thing. As a result, the Google Home speaker will not launch until Spring 2026, but when it does, you'll find it for $99.</p><p>Consumers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are on deck to receive it next year.</p><h2 id="coming-to-walmart-2">Coming to Walmart</h2><p>While Google is announcing its new Gemini for Home era, the company is also drawing awareness to an expansion, which brings Walmart's onn series into the mix. Google states it is partnering with Walmart to bring the new onn Indoor Camera Wired and onn Video Doorbell Wired devices to consumers today (Oct 1). You'll find 1080p resolution, Gemini's intelligent event alerts, and more, all through the Google Home app. However, it's worth mentioning that you'll need a Google Home Premium subscription for these features.</p><p>The Indoor Wired starts at $22.96, while the Outdoor Wired goes for $49.86 at Walmart across the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Along with introducing AI to its smart home ecosystem, Google has also unveiled a completely redesigned Google Home app for Android and iOS, bringing several meaningful changes and useful features.</p><p>Google says it rebuilt the Home app with three main goals in mind: to make it "faster, more reliable, and complete." The company explained that to integrate Gemini into the Home app, the app first needed to feel faster and more dependable — something the old version had been lacking for a long time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyGSHwjTtZQWniVYvojdyT" name="google-home-app-new-1" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyGSHwjTtZQWniVYvojdyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Google, the new Home app is now "significantly faster," loading up to 70% quicker on some Android devices. The company says it has fixed many long-standing bugs, while features like Live Views in the camera section now load 30% faster with a 40% drop in playback failures. With this update, Google claims the app should feel much more "resilient and responsive."</p><p>In addition to speed and stability, Google says the new "foundation" allowed it to integrate Nest devices directly into the Home app, creating a unified hub for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/im-done-buying-google-nest-products">Nest products</a>. The app now supports all core Nest devices, including every Nest Thermostat since 2015, as well as older Nest cams and doorbells.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bhjN8cfZ8tMWN97LiBKC8U" name="google-home-app-new-3" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhjN8cfZ8tMWN97LiBKC8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is also now built directly into the new Google Home app. The interface has been simplified into three tabs: Home, Activity, and Automations. The Home tab still lets you access all of your devices, but new swipe gestures make it easier to move between Favorites, all devices, and dashboards.</p><p>The Activity tab is where Gemini integration really shines. It provides a canonical history of everything happening in your home across both first- and third-party devices. It also introduces a new feature called "Home Brief," which gives you a quick daily summary of things with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a>. However, Home Brief requires a Google Home Premium subscription.</p><p>The Automations tab shows upcoming automations linked to your devices, while the company has also given the automation editor much-needed improvements. You can now simply tap the "Help me create" button in the editor section and type what you want, and Gemini will automatically generate the automation for you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VkNzr8mcNwPvmU6uT9AenT" name="google-home-app-new-2" alt="New Google Home app with Gemini built-in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VkNzr8mcNwPvmU6uT9AenT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="google-home-app-with-gemini-is-now-rolling-out-2">Google Home app with Gemini is now rolling out</h2><p>Other new features in the app include double-tap gestures in camera views to fast-forward or rewind, just like in YouTube. Gemini also adds more context to alerts, so instead of generic notifications like "person detected," it can provide details such as "Robin walking with flowers."</p><p>The most important addition, though, is the new Ask Home feature, accessible from the app's persistent header navigation. Ask Home is everything you expect the Gemini integration to be. It can help you perform as simple tasks as finding specific devices, but it can also help with other complex tasks like creating automations, locating a specific video recording, or even controlling multiple devices at once.</p><p>The new Google Home app is rolling out starting today (Oct. 1) and should reach your device soon. Alongside the revamped app, Google also announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">lineup of new smart home devices</a> to expand the ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The latest collection features high-performance ceramic, giving it a look that literally resembles wearing a ceramic ring on your finger, rather than a smart ring.</p><p>As much as it looks like it's made of glass, the new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic retains the same advanced health tracking capabilities of the original Oura Ring 4. The ring maker seems to be chasing some nostalgic mood ring vibes with this collection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="WT7PN9A3HygFbNiDj7Vgk6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WT7PN9A3HygFbNiDj7Vgk6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"By merging tradition with innovation and pairing it with the most advanced technology, we’ve created a ring that is as sophisticated in its design as it is in function—refined, enduring, and distinctive. Our goal is to make this wearable technology as beautiful and expressive as the jewelry we cherish," said Miklu Silvanto, chief design officer at ŌURA</p><p>As for the ring's dimensions, it measures 7.9mm in width, similar to the Oura Ring 4; however, the new collection is significantly thicker, measuring 3.51mm due to the zirconia ceramic material on the ring, which maintains the ring's color, luster, and durability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ring's weight varies anywhere between 5.1 and 8.1 grams based on the size of the smart ring. The Ceramic collection comes in four colors: Tide(green), Petal (pink), Cloud (white), and Midnight (dark blue). Additionally, Oura adds that since the color on each of these rings is inherent to the material and isn't a surface coating, it is said to "keep its richness throughout its life."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite being durable, this ring can get some scuffs from softer metals, like a dumbbell, when lifting weights. Oura says that these grey marks are metal transfers and are reversible. With each of these ceramic rings, users get a Ceramic Polishing Pad to wipe these marks and restore their ring's shine.</p><p>With this launch, the company says users can switch seamlessly between multiple rings within a single account without having to go through the hassle of syncing the data on the app. "Whether switching for a workout or matching an outfit, the transition is simple, ensuring uninterrupted health tracking across Oura Ring devices," the press release added.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection is available globally starting today, $499</p><h2 id="here-comes-the-case-finally-2">Here comes the case, finally</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="7RCERCqUGdNYgDdqnFS4M6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RCERCqUGdNYgDdqnFS4M6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you'd ask an Oura Ring 4 owner what they were missing, their answer would most likely be a wireless charging case. Finally, we have one. Oura has launched its first-ever charging case after giving us four generations of its rings. While it's only compatible with the latest gen smart ring, the case can power up to 5 full charges and complete one ring charge as well as the case charge in 90 minutes.</p><p>The case is black and looks like a clamshell with smooth, rounded edges, making the Oura Ring feel like a pearl in the center. Oura says each case is size-specific, so you can't share it unless someone has the same size. It also doubles as a secure spot to store the ring, because let's face it, sometimes I'm hunting for mine all around the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD" name="Oura-Ring-4-charging-case" alt="Oura launches it's first ever charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case is made from recycled aluminum and is anodized. It has a silicone insert on the inside, which creates a sort of seal, making the case dust and splash-resistant.  Oura's spokesperson told Android Central that this case could last you an entire month-long trip to Europe, considering the Oura Ring 4 survives for up to eight days on a single charge. So, do the math!</p><p>The LED indicator on the case displays the Ring's charge level when inserted, and the case's charge level when empty. Lastly, the case weighs about 60 grams, can be charged via a USB-C cable, and costs $99. As of now, this charging case will only be available in the US starting today (Oct. 1), but Oura says they'll bring it to more markets globally later this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The goal is to move beyond just tracking data to enabling proactive health management.</p><p>The idea is simple: blood results show the “what,” and the Oura Ring shows the “why.” If your A1C is creeping up, you can immediately see how your eating habits, workouts, or restless nights might be contributing. The Health Panels go beyond passive tracking and tie everything together in one app, so instead of a stack of lab reports, you get a clear picture of your overall health.</p><h2 id="seamless-in-app-process-2">Seamless in-app process</h2><p>Through a partnership with Quest Diagnostics, Oura members can book tests directly inside the Oura app and choose from roughly 2,000 Quest locations across the U.S. A licensed clinician signs off on the order, the blood draw happens in person, and the results land back in the Oura app with a design that highlights the most important trends instead of burying you in spreadsheets.</p><p>Beyond just providing results, the Health Panels service makes the data actionable with the help of Oura Advisor.

There's a major difference being noted in this updated AI scanner: Google Drive essentially now runs in automatic mode the entire time, foregoing the user's manual input entirely. The test showed that users can continuously place new documents before the scanner for automatic Drive storage additions, all powered autonomously by its AI software.</p><p>However, users can "stop" or pause this automatic function from taking place, though it seems the scanner will still identify that there's a document in front of it with a colored outline.</p><p>Around the centered stop button, Google Drive displays a squiggly, fun animation that circles it, and when it completes, your scan is done. Every scanned page/document is listed under your bottom row of icons, so users can easily swipe through and make sure everything is correct.</p><p>The publication noticed a slight design change in the scanner's viewfinder. Now, instead of appearing a little boxy or rectangular in the center of your display, the viewfinder fills up the entire top portion of your screen.</p><h2 id="material-3-expressive-is-the-design-all-apps-want-to-wear-2">Material 3 Expressive is the design all apps want to wear</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="TCMPzsDkCbKpvvd68Tkkrb" name="google-drive-ai-scanner-labs-update" alt="A snapshot of Google Drive's new AI scanner for documents, which now displays a colored outline when it's identified pages and a new "stop" or pause button right under its viewfinder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCMPzsDkCbKpvvd68Tkkrb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication states users may find this Labs experiment for Drive's scanner slowly throughout the week, via a new card that appears when opening the feature. What's more, the publication states this new test arrived shortly after Drive's Material 3 Expressive update, which seems to have altered its AI scanner in Labs.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive, Android's new design language, has been making its way around the entire ecosystem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-is-ditching-its-old-look-for-a-flashy-material-3-expressive-makeover">since earlier this year</a>, when it hit wearables.

While things become a little prettier, Google also wanted its Android software to be easier to use. Many UI elements have been altered to satisfy that "ease of use" mentality Google had for Android users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the company had been skimping on major changes in previous generations, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7 bring several big overhauls. And it looks like Samsung's hard work is paying off, as the company says the new foldables are seeing strong demand in the U.S.</p><p>Samsung, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/more-consumers-upgrading-switching-to-samsung-galaxy-z-series-us/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general">press release</a>, called the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 an "inflection point" for the category. The company says the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is "garnering the most interest" and "converting" consumers into Galaxy users "at a record pace compared to previous Flip devices."</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be a hit among Galaxy S Ultra users. Samsung says nearly 30% of people upgrading to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are coming from an S series Ultra model. The brand also says the new foldables set a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">"record-breaking" preorder period</a> in July, which continues even two months later, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 sales exceeding the previous generation by 50%.</p><h2 id="make-a-better-foldable-see-2">Make a better foldable, see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-29" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFWyqZviHc8mLXoxuTLZw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And honestly, it's not surprising to see why the new Galaxy foldables are selling well. Compared to the Z Fold 6, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is both lighter and thinner. Not only that, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 also solved one of the major pain points with previous-generation Z Fold devices by making the cover screen much closer to a standard smartphone.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7, while not much thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>, offers a larger battery and a bigger cover display. Both foldables are also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which has proven excellent for both performance and efficiency.</p><p>Samsung also says AI has played a big role in the popularity of the new foldables. The company claims around 80% of users have tried AI features on their Galaxy smartphone and "two-thirds use them regularly." Interestingly, though, the most used AI features are not by Samsung — the top two are Google Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>That said, it's great to see the foldable form factor gaining more attention in the U.S. Samsung is about to face its next competitor with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> launching soon, but it looks like the company has found a winning formula with the seventh generation of its foldables.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="943e6917-6e1e-4dfe-8851-022a2acf8c68">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjEHMiG3oH3ehN7hbGK5ym.jpg' alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest-ever book-style foldable by the brand.

Since you can't easily use an Apple Watch with an Android phone or vice versa, the decision largely rests upon which ecosystem you've already invested in.</p><p>However, if you're wondering how the Series 11 stacks up against the Pixel Watch 4, we have you covered. After all, there <em>is</em> a way to use an Apple Watch without daily driving an iPhone, so Android users can use the Series 11 as their smartwatch if they really want to. Let's break down all the differences between the latest Apple Watch Series 11 and the Google Pixel Watch 4.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-design-and-display-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-2" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiFcBrBww44uiawZ7NXyri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither Apple nor Google deviated significantly from their typical smartwatch design language when creating the Series 11 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>. They resemble their predecessors closely, but are distinct from one another. Apple Watches tend to sport a mostly square design with a cover glass and chassis that are slightly curved. Meanwhile, Pixel Watch models feature a "waterdrop" design with a circular shape and curved glass that seamlessly integrates into the chassis.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4 looks more minimalist and dainty than the Series 11. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Apple Watch Series 11</a> is available in either 42mm or 46mm case sizes, whereas the Pixel Watch 4 is offered in 41mm or 45mm case sizes.

There are also more colors and band configurations on the Apple Watch side, and the Series 11 has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with all prior bands within their size bloc (38mm, 40mm, 41mm, 42mm bands are interchangeable; 42mm, 44mm, 45mm, 46mm, 49mm bands are interchangeable).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-3" alt="The Apple Watch Series 11 display shown at multiple angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NkndnC6F4UVpJ8aA3gX28j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4's display is now domed to match the cover glass and is brighter than the Series 11 with a peak brightness rating of 3,000 nits. By comparison, the Apple Watch Series 11 has the advantage of supporting wide-angle OLED technology, which should make it easier to view off-angle than the Pixel Watch 4. The Series 11 display is also slightly higher in resolution, with a pixel density of 326ppi compared to 320ppi on the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>In terms of durability, the titanium Series 11 uses a sapphire crystal covering, and the aluminum Series 11 uses Ion-X glass. Ion-X is more crack-resistant, while sapphire crystal is more scratch-resistant. Google has Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the Pixel Watch 4 for scratch and crack protection. Additionally, both watches are swimproof and rated for 5ATM.</p><h2 id="apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4-hardware-and-specs-2">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Google Pixel Watch 4: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-BPM" alt="Blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch Series 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a hardware perspective, both smartwatches will be plenty fast. The Apple Watch Series 11 is powered by the S10 chip, a system-in-package processor that includes a dual-core processor and a quad-core Neural Engine. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> chip with a Cortex-M55 co-processor.</p><p>Google's leveraging of the co-processor for certain tasks helped it improve battery life for the Pixel Watch 4. The smaller version of the Pixel Watch 4 now lasts up to 30 hours, while the larger model can run for up to 40 hours. That's longer, at least on paper, than the Series 11, which is rated for 24 hours of battery life. It's worth noting that in the past, you could get more battery life out of Apple Watches and Pixel Watches than officially claimed.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Apple Watch Series 11</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>watchOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>S10 chip with 64‑bit dual-core processor; quad-core Neural Engine</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, Cortex M55 co-processor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Wide-angle OLED, LTPO3 display, 416 by 496 pixels, 1220 sq mm display area, 326ppi, up to 2,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display, 320ppi</p><p>3,000 nits, 1-60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>1GB (unconfirmed) + 64GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>L1 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou, RedCap for 5G and LTE, Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth 5.3, Second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (optional), dual-frequency GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic, Satellite SOS, </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Electrical heart sensor, third‑generation optical heart sensor, Blood oxygen sensor, Temperature sensor, Compass, Always‑on altimeter, High‑g accelerometer, High dynamic range gyroscope, Ambient light sensor, Depth gauge to 6 meters, Water temperature sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Compass, altimeter, barometer, magnetometer, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, multi-path optical heart rate sensor, cEDA, SpO2, ECG, far field skin temperature sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 24 hours, up to 38 hours in Low Power Mode</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 325mAh, 30 hours with AOD, 48 hours with Battery Saver</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 455mAh, 40 hours with AOD, 72 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 80% charge in about 30 minutes</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 25 minutes to 80%, 45 minutes to 100%</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 30 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Aluminum or titanium</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Ion‑X front glass with 2x scratch resistance (aluminum cases) OR sapphire front crystal (titanium cases)</p><p>5ATM, IP6X</p></td><td  ><p>Custom Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Multiple band options</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>42mm x 39mm x 9.7mm / 46mm x 39mm x 9.7mm </p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>42mm: </strong>30.3 grams </p><p><strong>46mm:</strong> 37.8 grams</p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 31g</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 36.7g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, Jet Black</p><p><strong>Titanium:</strong> Gold, Natural, Slate</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Satin Moonstone (45mm)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Apple hasn't confirmed the amount of memory onboard the Apple Watch Series 11, but it does provide 64GB of storage.

Lighter and darker tones should appear more vibrant and bold when watching your favorite shows and movies. Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus Adaptive Technology are included in these two QLED series TV sizes, alongside a processor that's 40% faster.</p><p>There are some smarts with this Omni QLED series, as Amazon states the TV can "adjust its colors" based on your lighting situation.

While most competitors like Apple’s AirTag or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Samsung’s SmartTag</a> rotate identifiers and use stronger privacy protections, Tile relies on partial rotation that only happens under specific conditions — every 15 minutes when near the owner’s phone or once a day if separated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the static MAC address never changes, effectively acting as a beacon anyone can lock onto with basic scanning tools.</p><p>This lack of encryption means stalkers with even modest technical know-how could use off-the-shelf antennas or Bluetooth sniffers to trace someone’s movements in real time. Beyond that, researchers warn that Tile’s own infrastructure could theoretically be used to build long-term maps of user behavior, raising deeper questions about how much control the company has over people’s location data.</p><p>The vulnerabilities were first disclosed to Tile’s parent company, Life360, in late 2024, but while the company claims improvements have been made, details on exactly what was fixed remain vague.</p><h2 id="anti-theft-mode-backfires-2">Anti-Theft Mode backfires</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H" name="Tile Mate (Pink Punch)_ Backpack.jpg" alt="The new Tile Mate (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9WeWxWbkiwaWv3ZWzUE6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Life360)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complicating factor is Tile’s “Anti-Theft Mode.” Rolled out as a way to make trackers invisible to scans, the feature requires users to upload government ID and selfies, while also agreeing to a clause that lets Tile share their information with law enforcement — even without a subpoena — if misuse is suspected.</p><p>The company has even tied a $1 million fine to confirmed cases of abuse. While this might sound like a deterrent, critics say the feature strips away key safeguards. When Anti-Theft Mode is enabled, Tile tags no longer show up in the Scan & Secure feature, making it easier for malicious actors to plant trackers on unsuspecting people without detection.</p><p>Researchers also demonstrated that attackers could record a Tile signal and replay it elsewhere, effectively spoofing a person’s location and potentially framing them.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787836/tile-trackers-stalking-research-unencrypted" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Tile insists it takes security seriously, pointing to ongoing bug bounty programs and ethical hacker collaborations through HackerOne. But until the company demonstrates meaningful fixes, the burden falls on users.</p><p>Experts recommend keeping firmware and app versions up to date, avoiding Anti-Theft Mode unless absolutely necessary, and considering alternatives like Apple or Google’s trackers, which employ stronger privacy protections.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then, at Meta Connect 2025, we got Oakley Meta Vanguard, which added Meta tech to Oakley's athletic Sphaera sunglasses.</p><p>The question is, if you're an athlete or an Oakley fan, should you go with Vanguard or HSTN? Believe it or not, the choice is pretty easy. If you need a pair of glasses or sunglasses for all-day wear, Oakley Meta HSTN are the way to go. Those who need something exclusive to workouts and fitness, with top-tier Garmin and Strava integration to match, should pick the Oakley Meta Vanguard.</p><p>There is a bit more to it than that, so let's break down all the differences between these two styles of Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-vanguard-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-pricing-and-availability-2">Oakley Meta Vanguard vs Oakley Meta HSTN: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-2" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VA476hFjCwHij8qkptswae.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2223" height="1250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> was announced at Meta Connect and are set for release on Oct. 21, 2025.

They're also based upon popular and longtime Oakley styles — Sphaera and HSTN. So, while tech enthusiasts might not appreciate the Oakley Meta frames, the broader group of mainstream Oakley fans might love them.</p><p>Vanguard is designed to only be worn in certain situations, like while outdoors or working out. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">no clear, prescription, or Transition lenses available for Vanguard</a>, which further cements the positioning of the smart glasses as outdoor-focused. They are large, with a hinge-to-hinge length of 136mm and a lens height of 59mm.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard are heavier than the HSTN style, weighing 66 grams. However, they'll likely be more comfortable and secure than the HSTNs. This is because the Vanguard style includes a silicone nose pad for grip and tight arms that'll rest securely against your head.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-01" alt="A pair of warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with gold PRIZM lenses in a peach tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnmfTTrc76kMufv7v5DjY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are more versatile, with a subdued design language compared to Vanguard.

At 53 grams, the Meta HSTN smart glasses should be more comfortable for all-day wear than the activity-focused Vanguard version.</p><p>Both pairs of smart glasses have the same camera, but Vanguard positions it between the two lenses. This might create a better POV experience for videos. Meanwhile, the HSTN model has the camera positioned beside the right lens. On the left side, there's an LED status indicator that lets others know when you're recording or snapping photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses from the back, showing the displays, nose guards, and Oakley Meta logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5jsrQT8PkTvEic94joEEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are rated for IP67 certification against dust and water ingress.

They both sport the same 12MP ultrawide with a photo resolution of 3024 x 4032 pixels. Both pairs of smart glasses can also record 3K video at 30 FPS, and presumably, Vanguard will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">the same or better video stabilization as HSTN</a>. They have 32GB of onboard storage, which translates to over 1,000 photos or over 100 30-second video recordings.</p><p>Additionally, Oakley Meta Vanguard and HSTN have two open-air speakers, but they're not identical. Vanguard's speakers are six decibels louder than the ones inside HSTN, and Meta claims you can hear them in up to 30 MPH winds.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard</p></th><th  ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3K (~2300 x 3100) at 30 fps (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td><td  ><p>Open ear</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Interface</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td><td  ><p>Touchpad on side, Meta AI for voice and camera</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td><td  ><p>5-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 1000+ photos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 9 hours per charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge. 50 minutes of record time at 1080p.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 36 hours</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 48 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Prescription lens support</p></td><td  ><p>None</p></td><td  ><p>-6.00 to +4.00</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>66g</p></td><td  ><p>53g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both glasses are compatible with iOS and Android via the Meta AI companion app. They use Bluetooth 5.3 for pairing and Wi-Fi 6 for updates and media transfer.

Oakley Meta Vanguard are the pinnacle of specialization — they're set to be absolutely excellent for workouts, training, and fitness, but probably not much else. Like the non-smart Oakley Sphaera sunglasses they're based on, Vanguard is intended to be used outdoors during physical activity, not all-day wear.</p><p>That said, if you're a runner, hiker, or biker who wants smart capabilities on your face, Oakley Meta Vanguard could be your best option. With Meta AI, Garmin Connect, and Strava integration, you can chat with your smart glasses about your pace or progress during your run hands-free. The open-air speakers for music listening and a camera for recording are added bonuses.</p><p>For people who want something sportier than Ray-Ban but more versatile than Vanguard, there's Oakley Meta HSTN.

The new version replaces the rigid, blocky color divisions with a smooth gradient blend, resulting in a more modern and fluid look.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/gradient-g-logo-design/" target="_blank">says</a> this update shows its growing focus on AI. The new gradient, which blends red, yellow, green, and blue, matches the look now seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> and other AI-related branding.</p><p>Although subtle, the new design also aims to enhance the logo's appearance at smaller sizes (such as favicons and app icons). The smoother transitions reduce visual hard edges and help the logo sit more harmoniously next to other app icons.</p><p>The change first appeared in the Google app’s iOS version and on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Soon after, the Android version (via Google app version 16.18) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/" target="_blank">adopted it too</a>. On the web and within some Android environments, the old version still lingers, though that’s expected to change.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google Home’s logo was quietly updated to match the new gradient aesthetic, at least in the iOS version of the app.</p><h2 id="wordmark-stays-put-2">Wordmark stays put</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:677px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.32%;"><img id="mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU" name="Google-logo-gradient" alt="Google's new gradient G logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKg5C37nsDWJQTWzbNpZRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="677" height="361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, Google left its wordmark alone, so the familiar “Google” lettering stays the same for now. The update focuses on the “G” icon, which serves as a key visual for the brand.</p><p>Also consistent is the brand’s commitment to its four signature colors. The difference: instead of hard boundaries, those hues now flow into each other.</p><p>This redesign may be seen as a smart play: the tweak feels evolutionary rather than disruptive.</p><p>Going forward, we’ll have to wait and see whether logos for Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and others will also go the gradient route. But given how the new “G” is being positioned, it’s hard to imagine those staying rigidly block-colored forever.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So if you're looking to switch to Garmin or upgrade your current watch, we'd say you should either start here or accept that you'll have to spend more for a more premium Venu or Forerunner model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This program is designed to gather sensor data from the Pixel Watch and pair it with user-submitted information to test how well the wearable can flag elevated blood pressure levels.</p><p>Participants who enroll in the study will be asked to answer a short questionnaire and allow the watch to passively collect health data. For a smaller group, Google may take the experiment further by providing a 24-hour blood pressure monitor for direct comparison.

This marked the first time that we had seen a modern mobile gaming device with a sliding mechanism since the Sony Xperia Play. Such a device comes with a steep asking price, but you can currently save $100 on the RG Slide from Amazon, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1"><strong>it's down to $199 for a limited time</strong></a>.</p><p>With that, you're not only getting a dedicated gaming device with a nostalgic design, but it's also equipped with a 4.7-inch LTPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate. Not only that, but Anbernic managed to squeeze in a 5,000mAh battery that will last for up to six hours on a single charge.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm" name="anbernic-rg-slide-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuGm2tyLZbTqg5RUHgMjnm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG Slide: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ/?th=1" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Have you been longing for a modern take on the PSP Go? Anbernic delivered just that with the RG Slide, an Android gaming handheld that features a sturdy sliding mechanism and impressive performance.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-4-7-inch-Capacitive-Assistant-Bluetooth/dp/B0FD9CPVSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension48="Anbernic RG Slide: $299" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're a sucker for nostalgia and want a gaming handheld that looks like the PSP Go but plays many of your favorite retro and Android games.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a gaming handheld that offers a bit more power than what the Unisoc T820 in the RG Slide can provide, or you need something a bit more lightweight and pocketable.</p><p>As you'd expect, there's more than one way for you to play some games on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ayaneo-might-bring-back-one-of-the-most-unique-phone-designs-and-im-here-for-it">RG Slide</a>, as you can just stick to the touchscreen if you really wanted to. But after you push the screen upwards, you're immediately greeted with a full set of controls, including dual low-profile joysticks.</p><p>Beneath the intricate sliding mechanism and controls, we have a rather familiar set of specs, starting with the Unisoc T820. This chip was featured in last year's RG406H and RG406V, but has actually been bouncing around since 2022.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn" name="anbernic-rg-slide-ayaneo-pocket-dmg-psp-go" alt="Anbernic RG Slide next to AYANEO Pocket DMG and PSP Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBKxeKNViqzivtUMQiueZn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The T820 is joined by 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage, giving you plenty of wiggle room to enjoy a lot of the best Android games. And as for emulation, the T820 is capable of playing up to GameCube, Wii, and PS2, along with a tiny bit of Switch emulation if you're playing lighter titles.</p><p>The most enticing reason to pick up the RG Slide is also the biggest reason why you might want to avoid this handheld. In order to provide a gaming handheld with a sliding mechanism that won't falter, it has to be made of metal, which is exactly what Anbernic has done. On one hand, it's great knowing that you can slide the screen up and down without worrying about it breaking. On the other, this results in a device that is almost twice as heavy as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>.</p><p>Even still, the RG Slide, especially for $100 off, is worth checking out if you have any interest in a modern PSP Go that runs Android and even has a 120Hz display. Plus, we expected other companies to follow Anbernic's suit after the Sony patent expired, but at the time of this writing, the RG Slide remains the only option.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To start, the post alleges that the company could have five Pixel 10a color variants in development for its expected debut. Those variants could include black, blue, dark blue, red, and green.</p><p>The tipster claims that these device colors aren't baseless, as they could line up with a selection of wallpapers that have leaked, too.</p><p>The wallpapers for the Pixel 10a sort of mirror the ones we see for the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 flagship series</a>. The colors are sleek and almost silky in nature, bending across the display, like ribbons. The wallpapers echo the colors the tipster alleged on Telegram, and these typically go hand-in-hand for default purposes. There is one wallpaper that was leaked that resembles a few brush strokes on a piece of white paper.</p><p>It seems like the paint brush one could be for the rumored dark blue Pixel 10a option. It's unclear if this is just an alternative or the "default" for that model, just to change things up.</p><p>These rumors claim that we might have a Pixel 10a launch closer than we think. MysticLeak claims Google could release the model "much earlier this time, perhaps by the year's end."</p><h2 id="only-whispers-about-it-2">Only whispers about it</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="sF3t98GhKoeabfkesR9Q3k" name="google-pixel-10a-black-wallpaper-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the black wallpaper for the Pixel 10a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sF3t98GhKoeabfkesR9Q3k.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MysticLeaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="6Xu7kkk9HT9wFvoq8dkm5k" name="google-pixel-10a-dark-blue-wallpaper-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the paint brush-like blue wallpaper for the alleged "dark blue" Pixel 10a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Xu7kkk9HT9wFvoq8dkm5k.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MysticLeaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="pXRXtSF8SEf8gceGdZtr2k" name="google-pixel-10a-red-wallpaper-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the red wallpaper for the Pixel 10a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pXRXtSF8SEf8gceGdZtr2k.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MysticLeaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Pixel 10a rumors have been pretty light, though there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-pixel-10a-pixel-11-series-codename-chip-leak">was a really early report</a> that supposedly spotted its initial development. This was back in January when a rumor claimed to have spotted Google's development of the Pixel 10a; mind you, this was well before we got our hands on the flagship Pixel 10.

If true, this would be the third year in a row that Google's mid-range line has done so. Additionally, Google is reportedly also looking into downgrading the device by implementing the older UFS 3.1 storage, instead of rocking UFS 4.0.

Redmagic's Astra was the outlier, with the tablet touting a 9.06-inch OLED panel that made it a fabulous device. If anything, I've been on the lookout for a small Android tablet; we just moved to a new house, and I wanted to set up a smart home dashboard in my living room.</p><p>As much as I enjoy using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad/i-finally-used-the-ipad-mini-and-im-obsessed">iPad mini</a>, I wanted an Android tablet to run Home Assistant, and coincidentally, Xiaomi debuted the Pad Mini at just the right time. The tablet was unveiled alongside the 15T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-15t-pro-review">15T Pro</a>, and I've been using it for the better part of two weeks now. Coming in at $429, the Pad Mini undercuts the iPad Mini, but that isn't anything new — Xiaomi has been doing this for over a decade now. The tablet is limited to select Southeast Asian countries, but it should make its way to other regions over the coming months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4929px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4929" height="2776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-pro-review">Pad 7 Pro</a>, the Pad Mini has a metallic chassis with a minimalist design, and the smaller size makes it easier to use anywhere.

What's great is that the interface is fluid, and I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever in the two weeks I used the Pad Mini. The 3K resolution of 3008 x 1880 is plenty adequate, and the tablet is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ platform — the same as the Xiaomi 15T Pro.

What I like the most is that Xiaomi's reading mode is intact, allowing you to turn the screen monochrome; this gives the Pad Mini a distinct advantage over the iPad mini when reading ebooks on the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is the side-mounted USB-C port.

With active noise cancellation, a wild 100-hour battery claim, modular parts, and high-resolution audio support, it feels like CMF wants to shake up the under-$100 headphone category.</p><p>The design stands out immediately. Instead of glossy touch controls, the Headphone Pro uses a multifunction roller for volume, playback, and noise cancellation. There's also an 'Energy Slider' to adjust bass and treble on the fly, without needing an app. This setup is similar to what Nothing used in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Headphone 1</a>.</p><h2 id="modular-approach-2">Modular approach</h2><p>There’s also a customizable button that you can program for specific shortcuts. The headphones are modular too, with swappable ear cushions that come in multiple colors like bright orange and light green, adding both comfort and personality. Replacement pads cost around $25, making it easy to freshen them up or change the look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1497px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-on-head" alt="CMF Headphone Pro worn over head" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1497" height="842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, CMF isn’t cutting corners. The Headphone Pro uses 40mm dynamic drivers with nickel-plated diaphragms and a 16.5mm copper coil inside a dual-chamber setup, all aimed at reducing distortion and widening the soundstage. They’re Hi-Res Audio certified and support LDAC for high-bitrate wireless streaming, while also offering a 3.5mm wired option.</p><p>A “Personal Sound” feature fine-tunes the EQ based on your ear shape and hearing profile. As for noise cancellation, CMF promises hybrid adaptive ANC with up to 40dB reduction that automatically adjusts depending on your environment.</p><h2 id="monster-battery-life-2">Monster battery life</h2><p>Battery life might be the headline feature: with ANC off, you get up to 100 hours of playback. Even with ANC on, CMF claims an impressive 50 hours, which is more than enough to cover a week’s worth of commutes or long-haul flights.</p><p>Charging is fast as well. A 5-minute charge gives you about 4 hours of playback, and a full charge takes around two hours with USB-C. If needed, you can also charge the headphones directly from your smartphone using a USB-C to USB-C cable.</p><p>Connectivity checks most boxes you’d expect in 2025: Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint pairing, Fast Pair for Android, Swift Pair for Windows, and full iOS support. That versatility makes it easier to switch between devices. For call quality, the headphones include an AI noise reduction system to cut down on background noise during conversations.</p><p>The CMF Headphone Pro comes in dark gray, light gray, and light green, with ear cushion colors to mix things up. They’re available now in Europe and the UK, while U.S. buyers will have to wait until October 7, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is especially true now that microSD cards are practically non-existent on even the best Android phones. However, thanks to external SSDs like the K20 Mini from ORICO, you can quickly offload pictures or videos in a snap, and ahead of Amazon's 'Big Deal Days' event, the 1TB version is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/"><strong>on sale for under $100</strong></a>.</p><p>In recent months, you might have noticed more of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/practically-all-of-the-best-android-phones-are-hindered-by-this-one-dumb-thing">portable SSD solutions</a> tailored to phones begin appearing. As someone who is constantly testing different emulators or trying to offload pictures, having a slim and lightweight <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/storage/aiffro-external-ssd-delightfully-different">portable SSD</a> has been absolutely divine. But there are a few other features of the ORICO K20 Mini that I've been rather enjoying, least of which is the built-in MagSafe compatibility.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD" name="orico-k20-mini-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$109.99</del> <strong>$99.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The days of your phone featuring a microSD are long gone, and have been for quite some time. However, accessories like the K20 Mini from ORICO look to pick up the mantle, and for less than $100, this is a must have for just about everyone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a quick and easy way to expand your phone's storage, without solely needing to rely on your phone's internal storage and/or the cloud.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You like the idea of what the K20 Mini offers, but it's still just a bit too expensive for your budget.</p><p>Until recently, the only way I could reliably use the K20 Mini with Android phones was to either use a MagSafe case or to slap an adapter to the back of a non-MagSafe case. Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> lineup has mostly arrived (we're still waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>), which includes the necessary magnets to use these kinds of accessories without needing adapters. Hopefully, other companies will soon follow suit, but at least there are workarounds at my disposal.</p><p>In addition to the ultra slim design, the K20 Mini is also fairly rugged thanks to its Aluminum Alloy shell that doesn't interfere with your phone's signal, while also being able to withstand a few bumps and bruises. Plus, ORICO's portable SSD can reach up to 2,000MB/s transfer speeds and includes a compatible cable in the box.</p><p>ORICO offers the K20 Mini in three different sizes, ranging from 512GB to 2TB, but for just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/">under $100</a>, the 1TB offers the best bang for the buck of the trio. We suspect this deal won't last forever, so if you're you want something to help you forget about wanting a microSD card slot, take the K20 Mini for a spin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Add in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> and the newest S25 FE, and you have something for everyone.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy phones offer one thing consistently: <strong>performance</strong>. You might not like some of the features or a few things about the way they look and feel, but when a phone gets the "Galaxy" name, it is Samsung's best-in-class offering. Both the small Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 FE fit the bill here. They're damn fine phones.</p><p>But they do have their differences. Here's what the standard Galaxy S25 simply does better.</p><p><strong>It has a much better display</strong>. I'm starting here because this is the most important difference. The S25 FE has a good screen, a 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED panel. The regular Galaxy S25, though, has one that's better; it's denser, so it will look clearer, it's brighter, and it has full HDR support. These differences might sound minor, but the display is what you're looking at 100% of the time you're using your phone. Nothing is more important than the display.</p><p><strong>The chip is better</strong>. The Galaxy S25 comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm SM8750-AB, the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The FE uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Samsung Exynos 2400 S5E9945</a>. Both are more than powerful enough to do all your phone things, but the Snapdragon makes a big difference when it comes to battery life and network connectivity. If you're into benchmarks, the Snapdragon destroys the Exynos, too.</p><p><strong>It has a better camera system</strong>. The telephoto lens on the standard S25 is a better piece of hardware, offering a higher zoom and better focal length. If you want to stand back and zoom in, you'll see the difference.</p><p><strong>The fingerprint scanner is better</strong>. A small nitpick that really bothers me. I hate in-screen sensors, but the S25 FE uses an optical sensor while the standard version uses an ultrasonic variant.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-great-about-the-s25-fe"><span>What's great about the S25 FE</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The S25 FE has a few things you won't find on the standard version, even though it's a little cheaper. The most notable features and specs:</p><p><strong>It's bigger</strong>. At one time, every company was trying to make phones as tiny as they could. Not today! For a lot of people, a bigger phone is better, and the FE is big without being too big. A 6.7-inch·2340x1080px display is the sweet spot for a lot of folks, and the FE nails it when it comes to size.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong>. It's bigger, almost 20% bigger. The FE has a 4,900 mAh battery compared to the 4,000 mAh battery on the standard S25. While the more efficient Qualcomm chip on the standard S25 means it doesn't last longer most of the time, the FE's extra capacity is the reason why. That's rare to see when comparing an Exynos phone to a Qualcomm phone, so the extra battery was a great choice.</p><p><strong>The update cycle. </strong>The FE ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and will get seven years of updates. Since the original S25 debuted so much earlier, it shipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and also gets 7 years of updates. When all the dust settles, the FE <em>could</em> get one extra platform update because of when it was released.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>You're going to be happy with either of these phones. They are very similar to each other when it comes to features and performance, but the regular S25 has just a bit more to offer.</p><p>I like the better display on the standard S25, and when it comes to network operability, the Qualcomm chip means the standard S25 is not only faster at transferring wireless data, but also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">Wi-Fi 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave support</a>, and can connect to more FDD, TDD, and 3G fallback bands that you won't find on the FE. Depending on where you are, this might make a big difference.</p><p>The FE has a bigger display, enough battery power to make it last as long as the regular version (a big win for an Exynos chip!), and charges faster. <strong>More importantly, both phones charge safely.</strong> Samsung learned its lesson and offers the safest methods available when it comes to refueling your battery, since we're monkeys who always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-is-it-safe-to-use-my-phone-while-im-charging-it">make bad decisions</a>, that matters. 🐵</p><p>I would spend the extra few dollars on the regular S25 because I care about the display quality more than the other differences. But really, this is a toss-up. You'll pay more for the standard S25, but it's worth every penny. So is the FE. Grab either and you're good.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M?tag=hawk-future-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&ascsubtag=ac-us-5476547492718419391-20" target="_blank" data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension25=""><strong>$650 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy FE series was designed so that smartphone fans could get the best bang for their buck from Samsung.

The company is calling this an "early preview" of the feature, as its rollout begins for all users. Vibes starts out as a simple feed where you can view videos created by others using its AI software. However, as time goes on, and you begin viewing more videos, Meta states this Vibes feed will become "personalized."</p><p>In Vibes, users will have a few options, such as starting from the basis of their own ideas. Meta states users can create an AI-generated video using content they have. Additionally, if you're digging the Vibes, you can "remix" a video someone else has had the AI create, and make it something different. Before remixing, Meta will deliver a pop-up menu with the following options: Add Music, Change Image, and Change Animation.</p><p>The possibilities right now in Vibes may seem a little basic, but Meta states it's working to improve those options and possibilities. It plans to roll out more "powerful creation tools" in the future.</p><p>Once you're satisfied with your remix, or even your personal idea, users can post it on the Vibes feed. Similarly, you can share your AI-generated video with others through DMs and cross-post that content to your Instagram or Facebook Stories or Reels.</p><p>As Vibe rolls out in the app, Meta states you can also access this new feed via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://meta.ai/"><u>meta.ai</u></a>, as well.</p><h2 id="vibes-joins-discover-2">Vibes joins Discover</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH" name="meta-ai-app-remix-restyle-launch" alt="The Meta AI app rolls out a new "Vibes" feed, packed full of AI-generated videos other have created, as well as a "remix" option that lets you change what others have done." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta also highlights that its app is capable of working well with its AI glasses, meaning it'll pair well with those new, "enhanced" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses</a>.</p><p>Meta's continued focus on the AI app being a useful tool for its AI smartglasses goes hand-in-hand with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">the app's original launch</a> earlier this year.

It opened up the door for regular users without a pair of smartglasses to still utilize Meta's AI capabilities.</p><p>This Vibes feed is like the video version of the app's original Discover feed, which hosts prompts that others have created and shared. Similar to that feed, users can, of course, "remix" those prompts (like videos) and turn them into something that's yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This members-only sale event is expected to showcase some of the best tech deals of the year, but take note: unlike last July&apos;s four-day Prime Day, this sale is only set to run for 48 hours. </p><h2 id="what-google-pixel-deals-should-i-look-for-during-prime-day-2">What Google Pixel deals should I look for during Prime Day?</h2><p>Prime Day generally showcases the best discounts on newer devices while ignoring most last-gen stuff. This means you should expect to see a ton of great deals on the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> are scheduled for release on October 9th (one day after the sale ends), so we could see some updated incentives to preorder. </p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-2">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>Yes! Like all Prime Day sale events, Big Deal Days is exclusive to Prime members. If you haven&apos;t joined yet, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of a membership without paying a cent. </p><p>Alternatively, if you&apos;d simply rather not shop at Amazon, be aware that the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors - such as Best Buy and Walmart - are expected to launch their own rival sale events at the same time. These stores typically match Amazon&apos;s prices without requiring any sort of membership. </p> ]]></dc:content>

There are several aspects of Bluetooth that make it an excellent choice for wirelessly connecting a wide range of devices, including audio gear. It's versatile, compatible, and continues to evolve, gaining new features with each iteration, such as Bluetooth 6 and Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>However, there are a few notable limitations that come with using Bluetooth for audio playback on headphones, earbuds, and speakers. Two big ones are range and quality. The average range for common Bluetooth devices (Class 2) is about 33 feet, which isn't much and can be shortened by interference, digital or physical, like walls or floors. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio">attaining lossless quality for music</a> over Bluetooth is near impossible, though emerging codecs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">AptX Lossless</a> are trying to make it a reality.</p><p>That raises an important question: should we focus on improving Bluetooth or switch to Wi-Fi? Qualcomm is a company that's doing both, developing AptX Lossless over Bluetooth <em>and</em> working on XPAN (Expanded Personal Area Network) over Wi-Fi. It's exciting, but Sonos has been doing Wi-Fi on its speakers for years, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> announced XPAN years ago.</p><p>So, where is Wi-Fi for consumer audio gear, like headphones and earbuds? It's a complex situation, but the future looks bright.</p><h2 id="why-we-need-wi-fi-over-bluetooth-and-how-it-works-2">Why we need Wi-Fi over Bluetooth (and how it works)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sonos fans expected its Ace headphones to support Wi-Fi like its speakers, but that didn't happen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many casual audio enthusiasts wonder why Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds haven't gained popularity yet, as evidenced by numerous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/xemeqs/do_wifi_headsets_exist_if_yes_are_they_any_good/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1cxdn6n/why_wifi_headphones_probably_werent_on_the_table/" target="_blank">threads</a>. After all, Wi-Fi speakers are very much a thing, and Sonos has a robust ecosystem of them. Taking that technology and applying it to headphones and earbuds should be easy, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>The perceived simplicity of this goal usually comes from a misunderstanding of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos work</a>. When connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones to your phone, it's your smartphone that streams the music from a service and then separately beams it to those headphones. Your phone is talking to a streaming service over Wi-Fi or data (or playing downloaded content), and subsequently shares the audio with a wireless device over Bluetooth.</p><p>That's not how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos operate. In this scenario, your phone effectively becomes a remote control for your Sonos speaker, which independently streams music from a service over Wi-Fi. That's how you can remotely control playback on Sonos speakers from across the world, whereas you typically need to be within 33 feet to maintain a Bluetooth connection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU" name="Sonos-Ace-app-home-theater.jpg" alt="Sonos app showing Ace headphones swap with Sonos Arc." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To apply this technology to headphones and earbuds, these consumer audio products must be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks and stream audio independently of an intermediary device, such as a smartphone. That's tricky, because you'd need to cram extra hardware into smaller devices. It might be why Sonos' first pair of headphones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>, opted for Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi, unlike the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p>But Wi-Fi has clear advantages over Bluetooth, which is why many audiophiles crave it. The connectivity protocol effectively removes the range limits of Bluetooth — with enough networking hardware and access points, Wi-Fi earbuds could work anywhere that receives your network's signal — and adds high-fidelity audio.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-s-xpan-technology-brings-wi-fi-audio-2">Qualcomm's XPAN technology brings Wi-Fi audio</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH" name="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro are Qualcomm XPAN earbuds you can buy today.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This technology isn't a fever-dream; it's real and available now in the form of Qualcomm XPAN.

In practice, it means your buds won't cut out if you walk too far away from your Bluetooth device, since they'll fall back to Wi-Fi.</p><p>Built upon the Snapdragon Sound platform and the S7 series of chips, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/problem-with-qualcomm-s7-sound-xpan-tech">Qualcomm XPAN</a> is trying to make Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds mainstream. There's a long road ahead, but the first consumer audio products to support XPAN were released this year, including the Buds 5 Pro.</p><p>Aside from the extended range, Qualcomm XPAN offers higher-fidelity audio by leveraging a Wi-Fi connection. The mode's maximum quality is 96kHz/24-bit, which is higher than CD-quality. In other words, XPAN technology and supported devices like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro deliver <em>true</em> wireless lossless audio beyond what conventional Bluetooth offers.</p><p>While 96kHz/24-bit is something you can use with XPAN today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/wi-fi-wireless-earbuds-with-24-bit-hi-res-audio-are-coming-very-soon-confirms-qualcomm" target="_blank">the future is 24-bit/192kHz lossless audio</a>.

The extra hardware needed to make it work could be expensive or open an entirely new can of worms on the research and development side. Plus, using Wi-Fi consumes more battery than Bluetooth, especially when compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">new standards like LE Audio</a>.</p><p>Mainstream earbuds and headphones with Wi-Fi support would need extra chips, a solution to the battery life problem, <em>and </em>a solution to the compatibility problem. While almost everything supports Bluetooth audio these days, Wi-Fi audio compatibility would need to be built from the ground up. For instance, you need a supported phone like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> to get the full 96Hz/24-bit audio of XPAN.</p><p>Even technologies like Qualcomm XPAN use a mix of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, rather than streaming audio directly over Wi-Fi, like Sonos speakers do. This helps Qualcomm address the battery life problem that would plague true Wi-Fi headphones.</p><p>The hybrid approach, combined with larger internal batteries — the Wi-Fi version of Xiaomi's Buds 5 Pro has a 64mAh battery compared to the 53mAh capacity of the Bluetooth version — helps Qualcomm deliver the same or better battery life as Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>We haven't seen Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds go mainstream due to technical limitations and compatibility issues, but that might be changing as emerging standards like Qualcomm's XPAN continue to grow.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Everyone is racing to make the best AI phone, but it's really a two-horse race between Samsung and Google. There are pros and cons to choosing either brand, and I've tested the latest features from both Gemini and Galaxy AI. It's clear to me that, if getting the best AI features on your phone is your top priority, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is the one to go with.</p><p>That's not to say that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is doing anything worse than the Galaxy S25 — it's just a numbers game. Google is very generous, gifting its best AI features to other Android and iOS devices, whereas Samsung's Galaxy AI suite is exclusive to its own devices. If you use a Galaxy S25, you're still getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">Circle to Search</a>, and AI editing tools in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. Access to <em>both</em> Google AI and Galaxy AI is a major plus for the Galaxy S25.</p><p>That's partly why I'm intrigued by a Verizon deal that claims to give away a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> for free, which sounds too good to be true. In some ways, it is — you have to add a line on the Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus plans. That means it's not <em>completely </em>free, but if you're looking to switch plans or already have one of these Verizon plans, this is a sweet way to get my favorite AI phone for less.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8500c295-5ccc-4f77-894c-2abf4be6dadc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA" name="samsung galaxy s25 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="8500c295-5ccc-4f77-894c-2abf4be6dadc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 256GB:  $799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del> <strong>FREE with eligible data plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is one of the best flagships you can buy right now, delivering a 6.2-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset.

Starting with feature availability, devices like the Galaxy S25 have access to Galaxy AI and Gemini, which is an impressive combination. You probably know all about what Gemini can do, but you should also be aware of the great things Samsung is doing on the AI front.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Bar and Brief</a> are both designed to use AI to put relevant items in front of you whenever you need them — think something like an AI-powered version of Apple's Live Activities and Dynamic Island, but for the Galaxy S25 series. These features are neat, but they heavily depend on whether you use supported services, like Samsung apps or Google Maps.</p><p>I find that the simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> tools are more handy, like Object Eraser and Audio Eraser, which perform better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser and Audio Magic Eraser</a> on the Google side of things. Additionally, if you're into wearables, Galaxy AI powers a daily Energy Score and Sleep Score with a Galaxy Ring or Watch. This is especially great when you consider these health insights are completely free, whereas Google has some Pixel Watch features behind a Fitbit Premium subscription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI" alt="The 'process data only on device' page in Samsung settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Best of all, Samsung has the hardware and software needed to deliver a private and secure experience.

Before you get sucked into the hype of a "free" phone, especially one as good as the Galaxy S25, review the fine print. In this case, be aware that you need to add a line, upgrade, or keep an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan to get the deal.</p><p>The savings that cut the entire retail price of the Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus down to $0 are applied as bill credits over the course of 36 months. If you cancel, switch plans, or upgrade early, you'll be on the hook for the remainder of the phone's cost.</p><p>That might sound scary, but it doesn't have to be, if you know what you're getting. With an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you get unlimited talk, text, and data, plus extra perks like mobile hotspot and 5G UW support. Those who already need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans" target="_blank">great wireless plan</a> can get one at Verizon while also snagging a free Galaxy S25 in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The latest of which is for the 8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q/"><strong>currently on sale for $0.50 shy of its lowest price ever</strong></a>. And the best part is that you don't have to wait for the next Prime Day if you want to get a controller and save money now.</p><p>It's easier than ever to find a good controller to fit your gaming needs, regardless of if you playing games on a desktop rig or from your phone. 8Bitdo is one of the more recognizable third-party brands out there, and after years of focusing on just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">Bluetooth controllers</a>, it ventured into the mobile gaming space.</p><p>Annoyingly-long name aside, 8Bitdo took everything that it's learned over the years and implemented that into a controller for your phones. This includes everything from featuring Hall Effect joysticks and triggers to remappable buttons via the accompanying 8Bitdo app.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller: $49.99" data-dimension48="8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller: $49.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="JyKKTUoeLJfJnyasgCvMbW" name="8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JyKKTUoeLJfJnyasgCvMbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller: $49.99" data-dimension48="8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller: $49.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.99</del> <strong>$39.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>It might not pack all of the bells and whistles compared to the competition, but this controller from 8Bitdo nails the basics.

The 8Bitdo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller falls in the latter category, so that might be something worth keeping in mind if you're sensitive to latency.</p><p>As for compatibility, this controller will basically work with any device that offers a Bluetooth connection. But when it comes to figuring out whether it will fit your phone, 8Bitdo thought of that too.

Having a strong Gen 2 baseline will be important to Gen 1 owners, who know the capacity will fade with time, as well as first-time buyers.</p><p>So far, the Gen 2s use up about 20% capacity per hour, including one 3K video, frequent Meta AI commands, and high-volume music streaming to combat outdoor ambience. A two-hour run left me at 60% capacity, while a one-hour run the next day left me at 79%.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-selfie" alt="Selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses, sitting indoors on a couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-on-face-close-up" alt="A selfie of Michael Hicks wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2939" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are notably thicker. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Using them indoors at a lower volume, with Meta AI commands turned off to conserve power, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s were at 69% after two hours — very efficient! Then, a two-minute phone call and filming my cat in 3K for another minute cut another 8% power, so take that into account.</p><p>I don't believe you could consistently use these for all-day audio streaming, unless you're willing to take them off once or twice for a quick top-off in the charging case. But it's <em>much</em> better than before, and the 50% recharge in 20 minutes helps.</p><p>Overall, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 battery boost makes me much more likely to wear them for an outing or work event, knowing they won't become a pointless face-weight after a couple of hours.</p><h2 id="these-glasses-don-t-feel-that-different-but-they-ll-keep-changing-2">These glasses don't feel THAT different, but they'll keep changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> launch in late October, Meta will push several new updates to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s: slow motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin/ Strava integration for real-time workout stats, "conversation focus" mode to enhance the voice of whomever you're speaking with, and new voice command shortcuts like "Photo" without the Meta AI wake word.</p><p>Meta has also promised that the Ray-Ban Gen 2s will be able to shoot in 1200p resolution at 60 FPS, but the option isn't available yet. Meta has even opened up its "Wearable Device Access Toolkit" so that devs can integrate Meta AI glasses directly with their third-party apps — but we probably won't see the results until 2026 or later.</p><p>Aside from battery life, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s don't feel <em>that</em> different today. But all of the above features make me optimistic that they'll feel more "next-gen" soon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBL0acIBb2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>On that note, even though the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses offer "over 2x more pixels" than the last generation for video recording, the difference doesn't feel that stark. You can notice more details and less compression in side-by-side videos if you look closely, at least.</p><p>But Nick, who tested the identical cameras on the Oakley Meta HSTNs, agrees with me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">image stabilization is fantastic at 1080p</a>, creating a super-smooth, gliding video while running fast that almost recreates the effect of a dolly shot in movies. So I find myself preferring that mode; maybe the 1200p 60FPS mode will feel like a nice, smoother compromise between the two, once that arrives.</p><p>Honestly, I just wish we'd seen a <em>photo</em> quality boost, as well. The unchanged 3024 X 4032 resolution is still great in ideal conditions, but I'd still like to see better low-light quality, color balancing that's not quite so oversaturated, or some kind of optical zoom (if that's feasible in glasses form) when the Gen 3s arrive in a couple of years.</p><h2 id="the-cons-and-nitpicks-that-you-ll-have-to-live-with-2">The cons and nitpicks that you'll have to live with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-vs-normal-glasses" alt="Photo of normal Warby Parker glasses sitting atop Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses on a blue-and-white patterned blanket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My normal Warby Parker glasses compared to my Ray-Ban Wayfarers. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my last Ray-Bans, I wore a "Large" pair that put less pressure on my face but wasn't well-fitted, so it slid down my face while walking (or running, especially). With this pair, I got the Standard size, and now they stay firmly in place for a ten-mile run, no matter how sweaty I get.</p><p><em>That's</em> great, but now that I'm wearing them on consecutive days instead of sporadic weekends, the better fit also puts more pressure on my nose bridge and ears. Even though the Gen 2s only weigh about 2g more — a fair trade-off for the battery boost — not everyone will enjoy that extra weight for long-term wear.</p><p>The design blends in <em>much</em> better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> glasses, and I like their style more than the Oakley HSTNs, but not everyone will agree with me.

The Wayfarer style comes in basic colors like black and blue, with various colored lenses available.</p><p>If you want a more stylish statement piece, the Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) is the style to opt for. Skyler's frame is shaped like trendy cat eye frames, giving the wearer flair and charm. The colorways for Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) are the most diverse, with the suave Shiny Mystic Violet frame taking the crown as the best-looking variant. This shade comes with a Clear to Amethyst Transitions lens color, adding even more character overall.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to look like you stepped out of the 70s, the Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) style is hard to beat. This pair has a chunky, thick, very pronounced look with quite a circular curve to the shape of the lenses. Apart from basic black with matte or shiny finishes, Headliner also comes in a warm Shiny Asteroid Grey colorway and lenses with Clear to Emerald Transitions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From navigation and communication to entertainment and work, our pocket computers offer unmatched convenience and access to information.</p><p>Yet, like any powerful technology, they can come with a potential dark side: smartphone addiction. This isn't merely about enjoying your device; it's about a compulsive and excessive engagement that can negatively impact mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.</p><h2 id="what-is-smartphone-addiction-2">What is Smartphone Addiction?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AiuhELAMNGTtg7ta9GoQgg" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-02" alt="Pixel 10 display home screen weather effect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AiuhELAMNGTtg7ta9GoQgg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematic_smartphone_use" target="_blank">Smartphone addiction</a>, often referred to as "problematic smartphone use" or "nomophobia" (no-mobile-phone phobia), is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to use your phone, leading to potential consequences in other aspects of life. It’s not <em>officially</em> recognized as a clinical disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but its symptoms and effects mirror those of other behavioral addictions, and many health care professionals recognize this.</p><p>Reading through material on the web, these are often indicators of smartphone addiction:</p><p><strong>Preoccupation:</strong> Constantly thinking about your phone, even when not using it.<br><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Needing to use your phone for increasingly longer periods to feel satisfied.<br><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms:</strong> Experiencing anxiety, irritability, restlessness, or depression when unable to use your phone.<br><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> Repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control smartphone use.<br><strong>Negative Consequences:</strong> Continued use despite knowing it's causing problems in relationships, work, school, or physical health.<br><strong>Sacrifice of Activities:</strong> Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of smartphone use.<br><strong>Deception:</strong> Lying to family or friends about the extent of your smartphone use.<br><strong>Mood Alteration:</strong> Using your phone to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression.</p><p>It's important to distinguish between heavy smartphone use and addiction. Many use their phones extensively for work or social connections <em>without</em> experiencing negative impacts. The critical difference lies in the loss of control and the resulting impairment in daily functioning.</p><p>Like alcohol or gambling, it's so much of a "normal" thing that it can ruin your life. And if you're affected, you probably can't "fix" it alone.</p><h2 id="who-can-be-affected-2">Who Can Be Affected?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reality is that <strong>anyone</strong> who uses a smartphone can potentially develop problematic usage patterns. However, certain factors may increase vulnerability.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6133055/">Adolescents and young adults</a> are still developing and face immense social and peer pressure. Often accompanied by FOMO (fear of missing out) and a need for validation, this can make a smartphone feel more important than it should be.</p><p>Folks with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9902510/">low self-esteem or other existing mental health conditions</a> often use their phone as a way to cope or escape, or even as a distraction from stress. This can deepen the reliance on the phone for comfort.</p><p>People who are otherwise isolated or feel like they are may turn to a phone as a lifeline to the "real world". I can totally understand this, as my physical health issues sometimes keep me indoors and feeling alone for a week or more. It's tough.</p><p>I'm far from being a medical doctor or clinician, but after reading what qualified people have to say, this makes sense to me. We all use our phones as a crutch from time to time and can feel like we depend on them. For some, this feeling of dependency simply doesn't go away. It's crucial to remember that addiction is complex and often multifactorial. While some individuals might seem more prone, responsible and <strong>mindful</strong> use should be a goal for all of us.</p><h2 id="getting-help-before-it-s-too-late-2">Getting help before it's too late</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN" name="digital-wellbeing-downtime.jpg" alt="Digital Wellbeing Downtime" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone makers have realized they can help combat any addiction issues by giving us tools to thwart them. I'm familiar with how Android does it, so that's what I'm diving into here, but Apple and Microsoft (tablets and laptops have an addictive screen, too) also have similar tools and utilities in place. These can empower us all to manage our smartphone habits and maybe stop a problem before it is created.</p><p>The central hub for managing your digital habits is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-digital-wellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Dashboard</a>. It provides things like daily usage reports so you can track how much time you really spent staring into the screen, how long you spend on a particular app, or even how many notifications you get. Try it, it's bound to be an eye-opener.</p><p>On the utility side, you can also set app timers to place a daily limit on how long you can do things like scroll Instagram, and once the time is up, the app is done until tomorrow. Focus Mode can even pause the apps that distract you the most, and they stay muted and out of the way until you turn it off.</p><p>The way your screen looks is important, too. When you remove much of the bright color, your phone becomes far less visually stimulating. For some people who crave that stimulation, grayscale mode can be helpful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nu7EjommBWHbtqLkyovpfn" name="Android-16-M3E-Clear-Notifications-1" alt="Notifications snapping in an out of place as you clear them on Material 3 Expressive." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nu7EjommBWHbtqLkyovpfn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079661?hl=en#zippy=%2Cturn-notifications-on-or-off-for-certain-apps">so good at notification "management</a>," and it would be a shame not to use it.

I think this is what this promises, and it’s so exciting right now because I think we’re starting to see the early stages of what can happen with it."</p><h2 id="ai-when-you-need-it-2">AI when you need it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HAfhPt9VfcTyHugnxSyEnN" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Agentic-AI-lifestyle" alt="Agentic AI lifestyle example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HAfhPt9VfcTyHugnxSyEnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2572" height="1447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noted how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ceo-blasts-microsofts-ai-efforts-says-theyre-using-someone-elses-models">AI innovation in 2025 would slow down</a> compared to the previous couple of years, saying that progress "is going to get harder," and that "the low-hanging fruit is gone."

Think of it as an upgrade to the current Google Lens, and Google's way of pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>'s multimodal capabilities onto more platforms.</p><p>With "Live Search," users can have real-time, interactive conversations with Google Search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/" target="_blank">AI Mode</a>, much like speaking to the AI chatbot on Gemini Live. This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well. Accessing this feature seems to be a lot more easier as opposed to navigating a ton of steps to help Gemini Live see what you see.</p><p>For instance, you're new to making a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_5822647110017996600&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgoogle%2Fid284815942&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Fandroid-os%2Fgoogle-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for. Or you could even ask it questions for a deeper understanding of matcha's history or its rise to fame as a beverage. The Live Search option is available to all Android and iOS users in the U.S. starting Sept. 24.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Needless to say, I'd guess that almost all of these 2025 phones will get discounts this year, plus we're likely to see some great deals on smartwatches, tablets, and more. The Galaxy Watch 8, for instance, is sure to receive its first major discount of the year, and I would be surprised if the Galaxy S25 Ultra dropped to under $1,000.</p><p>On the other hand, Prime Day sales don't usually discount last-gen Samsung devices, and you can expect cheap Samsung phones (such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">the popular Galaxy A series</a>) to only receive miniscule price drops.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-7">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>As with all Prime Day sale events, the vast majority of deals on display during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of Prime, or you could simply wait and see what deals Amazon's competitors have to offer. Walmart, for example, has already confirmed that its rival sale will kick off on October 7th, and Best Buy is expected to reveal its own competing event soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Three major features in v4.467 for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 start with Adaptive Audio. Now, when you're listening to your music or podcasts, your earbuds will automatically adjust their volume so you remain alert when outside.</p><p>Google states Adaptive Audio will "dynamically reduce the volume of unwanted noises and sounds," while keeping you involved with what's around you.</p><p>Furthering your listening experience is Loud Noise Protection. The changelog states that when a loud noise occurs, such as a fire engine's siren and horn, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will drop its volume, so the siren doesn't burst your eardrums. Rounding out the major features is "Head Gestures" for calls and texts. While wearing your buds, nodding your head will accept calls/begin a reply to a text.</p><p>Shaking your head declines both. Google warns that some apps will require a setup process to get this working, so be alert when this update arrives and you'd like to use it.</p><h2 id="an-update-that-brings-more-2">An update that brings more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8YusvDBivTmj5P9YAbVZq7" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-wintergreen-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Wintergreen earbud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8YusvDBivTmj5P9YAbVZq7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This final feature is more of a QoL (quality of life) update, as Google states Gemini Live interactions should be a little easier in "noisy environments." The patch notes say this update is implementing some "advanced audio processing" that puts more of a focus on your voice over background noises. It's like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-clear-calling-pixel-phones">Clear Calling</a>, but for your conversations with the AI.</p><p>Users should expect their Pixel Buds Pro 2 update to begin appearing today, if not in the next several days.</p><p>The last significant Pixel Buds Pro 2 update rolled out in January, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-pixel-buds-pro-2-finally-get-their-first-update-four-months-later">marked the device's first update</a> four months after its launch. That update was a little lackluster, as its changes/additions weren't explicitly stated after a Reddit user discovered its existence. It also seemed more like a prelude for more to come, as Google was likely more interested in fixing up some problems users encountered early on.</p> ]]></dc:content>
