The phone has even popped up on the set of a commercial. And just last month, the entire wallpaper collection somehow ended up online, adding more fuel to the hype fire.</p><p>Adding to the growing list of early Pixel 10 reveals, its brand-new sound pack—ringtone, alerts, and alarms—just leaked (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-10-new-ringtone-system-sounds-just-leaked/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The fresh audio first showed up on the YouTube channel "theVakhovske" and quickly made its way to the "Google Pixel Hub" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4274" target="_blank">Telegram group</a>.</p><h2 id="meet-the-new-tracks-2">Meet the new tracks</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oSRShAYxF1Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Sticking with Google’s trend of evolving its sound style, the Pixel 10’s new ringtone is called "The Next Adventure," a clear sequel to the current "Your New Adventure" tone.</p><p>Google is also gearing up to drop a new notification sound called “Kernel.” It’s got a similar vibe to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>’s “Eureka” chime, but with a softer, more laid-back tone.</p><p>Keeping the theme rolling, the new alarm sound “Fresh Morning” picks up right where “Fresh Start” left off. You can catch all these new sounds for yourself in the YouTube video down below.</p><p>If you’re interested in these new sounds, you can grab the files straight from the Telegram channel mentioned above and start using them on your current phone right away.</p><h2 id="older-pixels-might-get-these-sounds-too-2">Older Pixels might get these sounds too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chances are, Google will eventually roll out the Pixel 10’s new ringtone and sound pack to older Pixel models too. So if you’re rocking a Pixel 9, you could just wait for the official update. But if patience isn’t your thing, the Telegram channel’s got the goods ready for download right now.</p><p>The Pixel 10 was pegged for an August launch, but it looks like Google might be jumping the gun. It's hosting a Pixel Superfans event in London on June 27, and while the invites don’t name-drop the Pixel 10, the timing pretty much gives it away.</p><p>It’s looking like an early sneak peek at the new flagship. If that’s the case, it lines up with Google’s recent habit of speeding up its hardware and software launch cycles.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google rolled out the update to make it easier to skim long threads at a glance.</p><p>Starting this week, if you’re using Gmail on Android or iOS, you’ll notice Gemini stepping in with quick summaries right at the top of your emails, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-summary-cards-gmail-app.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> says. It kicks in when your inbox starts looking like a novel, so you can catch the gist without scrolling forever.</p><p>Not every email is getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> treatment, so things like promos or receipts are off the table. Instead, Gmail will roll out a Summary card when it spots a long thread or a bunch of replies that actually need breaking down.</p><h2 id="always-up-to-date-2">Always up to date</h2><p>These Summary cards will refresh on their own as new replies roll in, keeping you up to speed.</p><p>Google says Gemini will pull all the key takeaways from your emails, but for now, it only works with messages written in English. Also, you’ll need to have smart features turned on in Gmail, Chat, Meet, and across your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> to get in on it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:456px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:182.24%;"><img id="2YXawukws2gYqAuHGMZLAa" name="Gmail-AI-summaries" alt="Gemini summaries in Gmail for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YXawukws2gYqAuHGMZLAa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="456" height="831" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The search giant first rolled out its AI-powered summaries last year alongside the Gemini side panels in Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, and Gmail. Back then, you had to tap “Summarize this email” to get a quick recap. That summary now shows up on its own right at the top when you open a thread.</p><p>These summaries might actually come in clutch, especially with long or messy email threads. Google says they’ll only show up when Gemini thinks they’re worth it, but if they start feeling more like clutter than help, it could get old fast. If that’s the case, you can turn them off—just know you’ll have to disable Gemini completely in Gmail to make that happen.</p><p>If you’re using Gmail through a school or company account, your admin is the one who decides whether these smart features are on or off. Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10095404" target="_blank">support page</a> says they’re turned off by default in places like Europe and Japan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And in the U.S., it's getting even better as the company is finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/tap-to-transfer/">rolling out</a> the new Tap to Transfer feature.</p><p>The new feature's aim is to make peer-to-peer (P2P) payments “quick and convenient” in the U.S. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-new-tap-to-transfer-feature-for-samsung-wallet/">company announced</a> the feature early this month, the feature is now broadly rolling out this week.</p><p>Samsung has collaborated with Visa and Mastercard, with which users will be able to use a debit card that is already stored in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a> to send money to friends and family — straight into their bank accounts. It works by the NFC tech utilized by Samsung Wallet that swiftly connects to the recipient’s debit card stored in their respective digital wallets — be it Samsung Wallet, Google Wallet, and even Apple Wallet for that matter.</p><p>Additionally, the new Tap to Transfer feature also works with recipients who have their physical debit card, which supports tap-to-pay capabilities — as it will have a connecting chip, which can be used by Samsung Wallet similar to what users pay at a retail store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.50%;"><img id="QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB" name="Samsung-Wallet-Tap-to-Transfer-feature" alt="Samsung Wallet Tap to Transfer feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFunmZmWthQvnjw433ibmB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another important thing to remember is that Samsung Wallet wouldn’t charge any fees for the Tap to Transfer feature.

The fee only applies to the sender.”</p><p>Other than the new Tap to Transfer, Samsung Wallet is the go-to application for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Galaxy phone</a> users as they can store essential things like driver’s license, credit cards, passes, gym membership cards, loyalty and boarding passes, and gift cards, and more. Some college students can even store their student ID cards as well.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Samsung bringing interesting features to its Wallet app as users won’t have to rely on third-party apps for money transfer at least in the U.S. for now, and we hope the feature expands to even more countries soon.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Native Union got an early start thanks to the Voyage, a foldable charging mat that allows you to charge a phone and the Apple Watch together. The design makes the Voyage inherently portable, and the ability to charge two products makes it a decent choice for use on the road.</p><p>I've tested the Voyage for the better part of six months now, and having used it while traveling, I can attest to its charging potential and durability. Native Union may be a new entrant, but it clearly knows what it's doing, and the Voyage combines good build quality with 15W Qi 2 charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c6vLNTAHMMD9te5AaQbAmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I looked at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/satechi-onthego-3-in-1-is-the-best-qi-2-travel-charger">Satechi's OntheGo collection</a>, and what's evident is that these two products are nearly identical. The Voyage made its debut a year before the OntheGo collection, and Native Union alleges that Satechi stole its designs. I used enough charging accessories to know that brands often end up using the same manufacturer, and we'll have to wait and see if Native Union gets anywhere with its infringement claim.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR" name="Native Union Voyage" alt="Native Union Voyage review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpmLpL3jnScrcXAubZqRfR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4960" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming back to the Voyage, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Native-Union-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger/dp/B0DJCS5Q2N">available for $99 on Amazon</a>, and it is sold in two options — Sandstone and Black.

I only ran 23 miles after averaging 60 my first four months. Several work trips like I/O wore me out, but I have to be honest: The biggest issues are motivation and weather. It's getting hotter in California, and I'm months out from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youve-quit-your-new-years-resolutions-already-heres-how-to-get-back-on-track">New Year's resolutions</a>. I need a training reboot.</p><p>I suspect many of you are the same. That's why June is the right month to retool our goals, with wearable tech to help.</p><p>The people who organized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://run.outsideonline.com/news/global-running-day/">Global Running Day</a> recognized that people need a training reboot in the summer. They encourage people of all fitness levels to run, jog, or fast-walk a few miles on the first Wednesday of June every year.</p><p>It's a lovely concept, and I encourage people to join the fun with their local running org or shop. Many fitness watches and apps like Garmin, Apple, and Strava will reward you with digital swag. But this is just one day a year, and not everyone loves running like I do.</p><p>So I worked on a more comprehensive three-month plan to survive the summer heat and come out of the season in better shape than when I started, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> and other tools to keep me accountable. Here's how I recommend you do the same.</p><h2 id="june-focus-on-steps-before-everything-else-2">June: Focus on steps before everything else</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-steps" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Garmin Fenix 8 (right), both showing their respective step counts of 11,442 and 11,747." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though the 10,000 steps a day rule started off as a marketing gimmick, I truly got much healthier when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walked over 10,000 steps every day for a month</a>. The exact number is arbitrary; the important part is prioritizing consistency more than intensity.</p><p>Why? Because there's plenty of valid reasons to skip a hard workout after a workday: Tiredness, lateness, or responsibilities like cooking dinner will add up until you've spent a whole week slacking. But the only reason to skip a walk is lethargy. You can walk an hour whether it's blazing hot or at night by streetlight, even if you're worn out.</p><p>Plus, if you start doing a summer activity like golfing, pickleball, or softball, you'll naturally get steps even if you're not tracking a specific "activity" like a run or hike. Your smartwatch will keep you honest on how much you've <em>actually</em> moved and if you've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/make-sure-your-smartwatch-calorie-burn-is-accurate-with-this-scientific-calculator">burned enough calories</a> to earn that post-match beer or dessert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-walking-streak-2.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nscnS29GJni7WyKUPAeLU3.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most smartwatches have a widget or Tile showing whether you've hit your steps goal. My Garmin watch gives me badges for hitting 30 miles of walking or 300,000 steps per month, while a Galaxy or Apple Watch will praise you for closing your daily rings. It's a useful way to motivate yourself.</p><p>If you don't do anything else this June, take advantage of the late sundowns and pledge to walk for at least 8,000 steps a day.</p><p>Buy an epic fantasy audiobook or download a podcast that'll keep your mind occupied for dozens of hours, or else use the time to call family. Planned multitasking makes it feel less like wasted time, and you'll end up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">losing weight in the long run</a> simply by staying agile.</p><h2 id="june-to-july-stay-accountable-with-tech-and-people-not-just-money-2">June to July: Stay accountable with tech and people, not just money</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-daily-suggested-workout" alt="A daily suggested workout for an anerobic run on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZbJQ7pnaQLkWeZWYjCEZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several watches and apps have great self-guided training tools I'd recommend. Garmin Coach and daily suggested workouts tailor runs, walks, or strength training to your ability level. A Pixel Watch will give you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">target cardio load</a> and daily run suggestions like Tempo or intervals. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/">TrainingPeaks</a> has well-regarded paid training plans, while brands like COROS have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.coros.com/training">free training calendars</a>.</p><p>All of them share one key problem, though: Only you can keep yourself accountable and motivated, and you wouldn't be reading this if motivation weren't a challenge! Trust me, I get it.</p><p>People use paid incentives like gym memberships to pressure themselves to work out, so they're not "wasting money." But negative motivation only goes so far before shame takes over. You can always tell yourself you'll "go tomorrow" repeatedly when, again, only you are holding yourself accountable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-team-sports" alt="A Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a pink soccer ball on pavement, with a kid's baseball bat next to it leaned against a bush." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEoDnzoLj7iS7ZzwE7FyCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's what makes summer a great time for adults to reboot their goals. Unlike students who have sports clubs all year <em>except</em> summer, adults can typically find community activities this time of year for people looking to rekindle their love of sport and make connections.</p><p>Join a flag football league, running club, pickleball class, or any other team or community sport. You're much less likely to flake out without a legitimate excuse because others expect you. It's more fun than a solitary workout, so it feels less like work.</p><p>Some of these activities will continue into fall, but summer is usually when sports and training orgs recruit new members. So take the time this weekend to Google your best nearby options and get signed up for <em>something</em> fun before end of June. You'll still have to work out properly other days of the week, but these community days will keep you limber and motivated.</p><h2 id="july-go-all-in-on-sleep-tracking-2">July: Go all-in on sleep tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-03" alt="Sleep data on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmC2GCnBzhjJroVcCkEcXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3850" height="2166" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to studies cited by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230315-how-the-seasons-change-our-sleep">BBC</a>, people get (on average) an hour less sleep in June than in December, and 30 minutes less REM sleep. Early sunlight wakes you, the long days keep you out and active for longer, social drinking worsens your sleep quality, and warmer temperatures make it hard for your body temp to drop the 2–3º necessary for unimpeded sleep.</p><p>You'll hopefully spend June getting steps and joining team sports that tire you out for better sleep.

My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> notes stats like HR drop, skin temperature, time in sleep stages, restlessness, and duration.</p><p>Of course, many fitness smartwatches track the same stats, if you'd rather not buy two separate devices. What's important is using tools like Garmin Body Battery, Fitbit Daily Readiness, Samsung Energy Score, and so on to keep yourself accountable.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-clinical-sleep-lead-has-cool-ideas-for-future-of-smartwatch-sleep-tracking">interviewed Google's clinical sleep lead</a> earlier this year, and he warned that people are "terrible estimators" of their own tiredness and can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of." It's so easy to build bad sleep habits in summer and wear yourself out, so use July to fix those habits.</p><h2 id="july-to-august-give-yourself-some-deload-weeks-2">July to August: Give yourself some deload weeks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="htkG5ZCF9d6bJ8yEWNGN4R" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-training-status" alt="A post-run training status summary showing the current VO2 Max, acute load, and recovery time on the Garmin Fenix 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htkG5ZCF9d6bJ8yEWNGN4R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As my gym-nerd partner always tells me, even the most dedicated athletes pushing for serious gains need the occasional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/deload-week">deload week</a> so they can regain their energy and reach greater heights.</p><p>If you've managed to fill the first half of summer with constant walks, games, and early bedtimes, you're either going to make working out your entire lifestyle and personality, or you're going to burn out and fall back to normal.</p><p>That's why, as the awful summer heat sticks around, let yourself off the hook and aim for fewer (but harder) workouts through August.

There's the base-model Galaxy S25, the midsize Galaxy S25 Plus, the slim Galaxy S25 Edge, and the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra. Spanning various price points, each model is tailored to a specific kind of user on a certain budget.</p><p>This time around, there isn't an easy Galaxy S25 recommendation that'll work for everyone. You'll have to consider your personal needs and what matters for your individual use cases. For instance, a digital nomad that likes to travel light might love the Galaxy S25 Edge, while a power user might crave the battery life of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>If you're overwhelmed by all the models, configurations, and specs offered as part of Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, this guide will help you out. We've tested all the Galaxy S25 models at Android Central, and will help you figure out which one you should buy.</p><h2 class="article-body__section"

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> feels like a breath of fresh air. The standard Galaxy S25 sports a 6.2-inch AMOLED display, which is the smallest of the major Android flagships. That's either a pro or a con, depending on whether you prefer a more compact form factor. This model is also the cheapest of the bunch, starting at just $800 and frequently available for much less with post-launch discounts.</p><p>Don't be fooled, however — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-arent-the-same">the Galaxy S25 isn't like the rest of Samsung's flagship lineup</a>. The base model has shortcomings compared to the pack, like 128GB storage, no support for UWB, and a lower-resolution display without ProScaler AI. Although other AI features, like Now Brief, are available on the base Galaxy S25, the above omissions are notable oversights.</p><p>The cameras also haven't been updated since 2022, and leave a lot to be desired.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, for the good.

The AMOLED 2X display supports variable refresh rates up to 120Hz, plus loads of other specs like HDR10+ and 2,600 nits of peak brightness. The FHD+ display (1080 x 2340) is still gorgeous to use and plenty bright.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-11" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yh6bUfGy9n8ZzrhfyDaAJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a 4,000mAh battery and support for slow 25W wired charging, the Galaxy S25 isn't outstanding for battery life. However, it's better than the Galaxy S25 Edge (for whatever that's worth) and decent overall. You can get a full day of charge with moderate usage, easily.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is for the smartphone user who just wants the basics in a compact form factor and at a fairly affordable price. There's enough power here to make this phone feel like a bona-fide flagship without going overboard.

It's not very original, with the same general design and few hardware upgrades compared to its predecessor. Like the base Galaxy S25, the Galaxy S25 Plus retains the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S22 series. Still, at $999 and packing a 6.7-inch display, the Galaxy S25 Plus tends to hit the right price and size for a lot of people.</p><p>It builds upon the building blocks of the Galaxy S25, elevating them to provide a more comprehensive experience. The device features a larger battery with a 4,900mAh capacity, and the larger size enables a 45W wired charging speed. That addresses a common gripe with the base model, and it's not the only one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus also starts at 256GB of storage with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care" target="_blank">UFS 4.0</a> support, a UWB chip for precise location finding, and a larger (and improved) QHD+ display with ProScaler AI.

You get a 50MP primary shooter, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a crucial 10MP telephoto lens supporting up to 3x optical zoom.</p><p>At 75.8mm x 158.4mm x 7.3mm and weighing 190 grams, the Galaxy S25 Plus is designed for individuals who require more than the base model in a somewhat compact form factor. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is better, but it's also an expensive behemoth. Out of the four Galaxy S25 models, the Plus is clearly the most practical option for most buyers.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="dcb4d03e-cddf-41e7-9fb6-1fd5244471ed">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWsYJeA9FLGbXsBt6BFQ8T.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus in Silver Shadow official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title"></div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Practical price, practical package</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus delivers a ton of features while still remaining somewhat  affordable.

Mixed in with articles about aquarium heaters, the effect of Saharan dust on Florida's ecosystem, and doing your own front-end alignment (don't, trust me), I recently saw that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tsa-issues-warning-smartphones-devices-172509328.html" target="_blank">TSA has issued another warning about juice jacking at the airport</a>.</p><p>Juice jacking is even dirtier than it sounds. It's when someone plants a computer inside a USB charging station that can try to send <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tech-talk-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-malware">malware</a> to the things you plug in to charge. We've all seen those charging kiosks, and there's plenty of room to sneak a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> inside to redistribute software you<em> really</em> don't want to tangle with.</p><p>The TSA recommends that you never plug a smart device directly into one of those kiosks. I don't know if they have new intel they aren't sharing or they just wanted to remind us about it, but with that warning in mind, let's talk about how you should charge your stuff on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of ways to make sure you aren't presenting a direct path for malware to get to your phone or laptop through the USB port. One is to carry around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cukteks-40000mah-battery-pack">battery pack</a> and plug it into the public USB charger, then plug your phone (or whatever) into the battery. Both will charge at the same time.</p><p>Another way is with a power-only cable. A USB cable needs to have two wires to charge your phone, but usually has a few extra wires to carry data back and forth to other things you might want to plug in, like headphones or a thumb drive. You don't need those data wires to charge your phone.</p><p>You can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Charge-Only-Power-Only-Protector-USBSCHAC1M/dp/B09479KTC9/" target="_blank">a power-only USB cable</a> from anywhere that sells electronics, like Amazon. You can also buy little adapters that only pass through power; plug them on the end of your cable, and it effectively cuts off all the wires except for the ones you need for power transfer. Either is a good choice.</p><p>Use your "regular" cable when you use your own charger — the thingy you plug into the wall. Any other time, use the one that only provides power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW" name="battery-packs-169.jpg" alt="Battery packs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1548" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The third option, and the one I like, is to use a cable with a switch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OSOM-Privacy-Cable-Blocker-Prevent/dp/B0C41BW4N8/" target="_blank">OSOM Privacy Cable</a>. I picked up a couple of these a while back, and anytime I might need to use a public charging kiosk at a train station or airport, I use one.</p><p>It's simple, and if you're handy, you could make one yourself. It has a tiny switch at the end that connects the data wires when it's in one position and disconnects them in the other. It's not really any better way to protect yourself than using a battery pack or a power-only cable, but to me, it's more convenient than carrying around stuff I don't need.</p><p>What's important is that you use one of these methods. I don't think this happens too often, but I have seen a "compromised" USB kiosk at Oakland International Airport. I know it was, as they were there removing it because it had a small computer inside that was spreading malware. It was kind of cool seeing inside, but not very cool thinking it might have contaminated someone else's belongings. People can be bad.</p><p>We can't tell you what to think or what to do. We can tell you how easy it is to protect yourself from things like this, though. Trust me, spending $20 on cables is way cheaper than getting bitten by malware in the long run.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It will break down, go bad, or wear out eventually, so it's worth thinking about even just a little, but few people do.</p><p>I'm not here to change your mind or tell you how to think, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones" target="_blank">repairability</a> is one of the most important factors for me when it comes to the features of the products I buy. Maybe because I'm good enough at it to be dangerous, or maybe because I'm cheap, but knowing I can fix something at half the cost instead of replacing it is important, even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">my favorite phone</a> is impossible to fix. Dammit.</p><p>If you're one of the people who do care about fixing your stuff, you gotta love seeing what's happening in the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> lately. I'm not talking about improvements in the sound department, though I understand that is getting better, but about how companies are starting to make stuff you can either fix yourself or get someone else to fix for you. Awesome.</p><p>Sony's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch">WH-1000XM6 headphones</a> (man, these stupid names) are the latest set making a bit of a buzz in the way you want your headphones to make a buzz. As iFixit shows us in a teardown video, screws replace a lot of glue, and everything is laid out so you can get to it without cutting open any plastic.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zRyc5aU8pZ0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It still might look a little confusing once you see all the parts, but compared to the way companies used to bury those parts in glue and plastic, it's a big change. And it's a good change — even if you never plan to fix something like a pair of headphones yourself, this will let a qualified technician do it at half the cost. That's money saved you could spend on other stuff like groceries or weed.</p><p>You might think that fixing an old pair of headphones is nothing new, but we're talking about Bluetooth technology here. You know, with little circuit boards and batteries and ribbon cables. That's a lot different from your old headset held together with electrical tape and speaker wire. Yeah, I have those, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-colorway-parts-hero.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in black with replaceable parts scattered about." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RTvQZUpM864zgAJRcgyg8m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even more encouraging is seeing earbuds becoming repairable.

Companies like Sony, PQ, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-amazon-echo-buds-waterproof">Amazon</a> make earbuds that aren't impossible to crack open and fix once they go bad. <em><strong>When</strong></em> they go bad, because they will.</p><p>Unfortunately, we aren't seeing the same from every company. Apple, Samsung, and Google sell some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">very recognizable earbuds</a> that a lot of people use with their smartphones.

Someone like me, probably.</p><p>In the meantime, seeing more of the stuff we buy when we pick up a new phone, being more friendly when it comes to you and your toolkit, is great. Here's hoping other companies see the light and get on board.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They always felt like enthusiast watches for runners or outdoorsy types, neither of which I am. Additionally, the buttons and confusing UI made them difficult to pick up. However, the Garmin Vivoactive 6 seems to be a remedy to this, offering a fairly affordable alternative with a simple design and a more user-friendly UI.</p><p>The Vivoactive 6 feels like the perfect entryway into the world of Garmin watches, especially if you’re not really a runner. You may not get all the latest and greatest features or specs, as anyone looking for those will have to spend significantly more on a watch.

It's on the smaller side, which may not suit you if you have larger wrists, but the plus side is that it's neither thick nor heavy. In fact, the watch is very light and comfortable to wear. This is great not only in everyday use, but also when wearing it to bed, as I hardly notice it's on, unlike other smartwatches.</p><p>It's fairly tough, too, although probably not as sturdy as pricier models. You still get solid water protection with 5 ATM, meaning the watch can be submerged up to 50 meters deep, which should appeal to casual swimmers. Gorilla Glass 3 protection should also help keep the display intact, while the aluminum bezel and fiber-reinforced polymer case give the watch a soft feel.</p><p>The OLED display is very vibrant and fairly easy to maneuver, despite the rather large bezels. It's incredibly responsive and bright enough to use outdoors. At just 1.2 inches, I wish the display were larger, but it still serves its purpose.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-06" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 on a concrete surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYbMgLLaxKMxfPwAQYTGiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing I noticed immediately after setting up the Vivoactive 6 is that the UI is a significant improvement over the Venu 3, which is the only other Garmin watch I've used. It's not perfect, but menus feel more logical, and other UI changes make more sense, such as accessing notifications by swiping down from the home screen and then Glance shortcuts by swiping up. Quick settings are accessible by swiping down, or you can press and hold the main power button.

I consistently get a full week of battery life, with one or two workouts tracked per day and the display set to gesture activation. You'd get less battery with the always-on display activated, but I find the gesture option to be perfectly adequate.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-vivoactive-6-fitness"><span>Garmin Vivoactive 6: Fitness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-14" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6, Venu 3, Pixel Watch 3, and Oura Ring 4 next to dumbbells" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/warDH6o9Dgr6nmLNSBpWKC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-vs-venu-3"><strong>Garmin Vivoactive 6 vs. Venu 3</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately"><strong>Garmin Connect Plus hands-on</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-io-2025-health-connect-support-details"><strong>Garmin is getting Health Connect support</strong></a></p></div></div><p>The Vivoactive 6 doesn't come with Garmin's latest Elevate sensor technology, meaning you won't get the improved accuracy found on models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a> or even the Venu 3.

That said, it's clear that this watch is more focused on encouraging users to be active than on pushing them, which, again, would be more characteristic of a Forerunner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-18" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 daily workout suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXefbBe2tNuAhWvQJ2oNT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The watch features built-in GPS and supports various navigational systems, which are pretty accurate and handy for tracking your route on runs or hikes. Keep in mind that you don't get an altimeter, which is a downside if you enjoy the outdoors and hiking. You also can't download maps to the watch, which may be a downside for some.</p><p>You do, however, have access to workout videos directly on the watch, which is helpful when following the pre-made workouts created in Garmin Connect. You can also curate your own workout within the app, although this feels like a very time-consuming and tedious task, and I would quit halfway through.</p><p>If you're a weightlifter like me, you'll likely be pleased with the workout tracking. It can automatically detect reps and rest between sets.

Notifications can often take up the entire screen, which can be quite annoying when you're actually trying to do something on the watch. Furthermore, the vibration intensity can't be altered, so you'll get a pretty jarring buzz unless you turn the vibration off.</p><p>Speaking of vibrations, the watch features a Smart Alarm that utilizes sleep tracking to wake you up at the optimal time, so you feel less groggy. It sounds great in theory, but I've found this feature pretty useless or annoying. Oftentimes, I wake up ahead of my set alarm, so the Vivoactive ends up just being late to the party when the smart alarm finally goes off. It also only has a 30-minute window, which doesn't seem like enough time to take advantage of a feature like this, especially if your sleep schedule is as erratic as mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-17" alt="Move Break alert on the Garmin Vivoactive 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTYwPtjmSaJ9VV5GsTqVMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3814" height="2145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vivo<em>active</em> also has Move Break alerts to remind you to get up and move, which makes sense.

One UI 8 brings all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>'s perks to the Galaxy S25 for the first time, and beta-enrolled users try out new features before they're publicly released.</p><p>To start, Samsung's AI Select tool is now faster than ever. According to Android Central's Nick Sutrich in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 beta hands-on</a>, it takes approximately 2.2 seconds to look something up. One UI 8 also takes multitasking to the next level, with this 90:10 feature, which lets you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size, helping users switch between two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is crammed when the screen is split.</p><p>Samsung's Weather app, Reminder, Health, and Auracast also get major glow-ups with this new update. Furthermore, Samsung also confirmed that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">next-gen foldables phones</a> will launch later this year with a stable version of One UI 8.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-series-allegedly-clears-another-certification-2">Galaxy Watch 8 series allegedly clears another certification</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.67%;"><img id="QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-and-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-CMIIT-certified" alt="Galaxy watch 8 and galaxy watch 8 classic leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QVzVDQzpLvuF7L8BAZt7Qg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XpertPick)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-galaxy-watch-8-series-clears-another-certification-new-leak-claims"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>We might be just mere<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> weeks away from the next Unpacked event</a>, and it has been raining leaks.</p><p>The most recent one comes from folks at Xpert Pick who claim to have spotted both watches from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8 series </a>pass through the CMIIT certification (Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology).</p><p>As we can see in the screenshot, both certificates mention model numbers attached to the alleged upcoming wearables, SM-L3350 and SM-L5050, respectively. Previous leaks have indicated that these model numbers seem to be associated with the Galaxy Watch 8 (LTE) and the Watch 8 Classic (LTE).</p><p>The certification notes within the screenshot describe both these devices to have eSIM technology with an independent eUICC chip, which will allow users to connect to cellular networks without the phone, which is what the previous leaks have been indicating as well.</p><hr><h2 id="nothing-is-giving-up-its-glyph-lights-2">Nothing is giving up its Glyph lights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-is-giving-up-the-one-thing-that-sets-its-phones-apart"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Nothing has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-emoji-teasers-impending-launch">dropping several hints on X</a> about its upcoming flagship Nothing Phone 3. In its most recent post, it suggested that its next flagship will not have the signature Glyph Light interface on the rear panel, which has been featured on previous models.</p><p>In an almost straightforward post, the company announced the end of the Glyph Interface in an X video, captioned "we killed the Glyph Interface," where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions">Phone 1</a>'s lights dramatically blink out to black.</p><p>This could potentially mean that its next flagship device, Nothing Phone 3 may not show up with those rear light, a feature that drew several people to buy the Nothing phones in the first place.</p><p>That said, if the company takes away the one thing that sets it apart, what would its rear panel actually look like? Some speculate that the phone could come with a dot-matrix display on the back. The teasers of Phone 3 had videos with the same dot-matrix pattern, showing a pixelated "3" or Pac-Man-style animations with dots, majorly hinting at a change in visual design.</p><hr><h2 id="oneplus-snuck-in-two-new-phones-on-the-ace-5-series-2">OnePlus snuck in two new phones on the Ace 5 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM" name="OnePlus- Ace-5-Racing-series" alt="OnePlus adds two new phones to Ace 5 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VvBrdBd4AwWSb6jqNSjzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GSM Arena)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-quietly-launched-two-new-ace-5-series-phones-and-they-look-spectacular"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>OnePlus has just launched two new phones: the OnePlus Ace 5 Ultra Edition and the Ace 5 Racing Edition.</p><p>Designed with gaming enthusiasts in mind, these phones combine sleek design, powerful hardware, and impressive battery life for an "ultimate gaming experience."

However, there's another trend this year that I expect we'll not forget: the era of the thin phone.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 pushed the boundaries of thickness in folding phones, and now Samsung has done the same in smartphones with the Galaxy S25 Edge. Ahead of the rumored iPhone 17 Air's debut in September, Samsung's latest flagship has already ruined thicker phones for me.</p><p>At first glance, the Galaxy S25 Edge may be considered a downgrade compared to its siblings. It has the smallest battery and one less camera, but as the adage goes, seeing is believing. In this case, it would be more apt to say that <em>holding is believing.</em><em><strong> </strong></em></p><p>There's room for improvement, but the Galaxy S25 Edge is a beautiful phone that you can only appreciate once you hold it. When you do, you may forgive its shortcomings.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-price-and-availability"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Price and Availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-27" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge was first teased at the Unpacked event for the Galaxy S25 launch on January 22, 2025.

Measuring 5.8mm thick (excluding the camera bump), it’s currently the thinnest flagship phone, although it is still much thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>, which is 4.21mm thin when unfolded. For comparison, the Edge is between 1.4mm and 2.4mm thinner than the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>It’s not just about the thickness, as arguably the more impactful feature is the weight. At 163 grams, it’s just one gram heavier than the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, but features the larger display of the Galaxy S25 Plus and the primary camera of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> weighs 27 grams more, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is a whopping 55 grams more, or over a third of the total weight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy S25 Ultra (left) and Galaxy S25 Edge (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These numbers may seem inconsequential, but they are core to the Galaxy S25 Edge offering. It combines the best features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> into a phone that’s thinner, lighter, and much more pocket-friendly.</p><p>Once you hold the Galaxy S25 Edge in your hands, the thin profile and light weight quickly assuaged many of my concerns around missing features, the smaller battery, or the lack of a telephoto lens. I didn’t realize that phone thickness was important to me until I used the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>Beyond the design, you get a structure that Samsung has refined over the past few years. There’s a titanium build that feels extremely premium, and it’s paired with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. Despite some concerns about the thickness, especially considering other phones in history that have been thin and bent easily, the Galaxy S25 Edge has shown no signs of bending easily during daily usage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-16" alt="Left side mmWave antenna and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-11" alt="Right side buttons and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2brMZ5ASdSxTc7usxWHJ5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-4" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF77UXEr7SF8QynYJxn45Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The 6.7-inch display on the front is protected by Corning’s new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which is virtually identical to the Ceramic glass used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, but lacks the anti-glare finish.

When Samsung first revealed the battery capacity, I expected this to be my biggest challenge, but as it turns out, this is only partially true.</p><p>Like many phone makers, Samsung has been promising all-day battery life on its phones for many years, and most phones deliver with some charge remaining at the end of the day. The Galaxy S25 Edge also delivers all-day battery life, but it gets dangerously close to needing a recharge before the end of the day.</p><div><blockquote><p>Battery life isn't phenomenal, but it's also not as bad as you would expect.</p></blockquote></div><p>Everyone’s usage varies, so what does all-day battery life look like? Charging to full at 11 a.m. (having forgotten to charge it overnight), the Galaxy S25 Edge lasted a total of 28 hours on a full charge with just under seven hours of screen time and around seven percent battery remaining. It’s fairly representative of the maximum battery life you can expect, and that was with light gaming, a lot of streaming, web browsing, and some calls, with half the day on Wi-Fi and half without.</p><p>The battery life meets my expectations for moderate to heavy usage in a day, and should be sufficient for most users. However, it’s much harder to excuse the slower 25W charging, which takes around 80 minutes to charge the phone. Samsung opted against including the 45W charging from the S25 Plus, despite the S25 Edge costing more, which is harder to accept considering the price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>200MP primary camera from the S25 Ultra.</strong></li><li><strong>12MP ultrawide camera.</strong></li><li><strong>No telephoto lens, quality degrades after 2x.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge has two rear cameras.

the OIS is somewhat ineffective, and the camera is unable to compensate for the loss of detail. Instead, you get photos that have slight motion to them and lack the finesse of other cameras. You also need the larger pixel size to compensate for light in low-light conditions, so the 12MP photos tend to be the best overall.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Unlike Samsung’s past Edge phones, such as the Galaxy S6 Edge and its waterfall display design, there are no exclusive software tricks on this phone.

I’ve been a fan of One UI for many years, but One UI 7 feels better than ever before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another great addition to the software is the deep partnership between Samsung and Google.

Everything else was likely to be extremely solid.

The event is supposedly set to begin at 2:30pm at 38 Southwark Street, London. However, there's a catch — alleged invitees need to pass a test and enter a contest to be shortlisted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zP94fsDoe3cLANjPXFjGYY" name="Pixel-superfans-launch-event" alt="Google announces content for pre-launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zP94fsDoe3cLANjPXFjGYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google seems to have included a few questions at the end of their emails to gauge how much of a Superfan you actually are. The questions range from "What is your favorite Pixel feature and why?" to the types of offers that attract someone when purchasing a new Pixel. Those invited have until June 4 to complete the quiz and enter the contest; winners will be announced on June 11.</p><p>Additionally, the email also adds that attendees get exclusive hands-on time with the new Pixel phones, get treated to custom Pixel themed goodies and a change to be in a "one off interview and Q/A session with Googlers."</p><p>That said, this seems really early for Google to launch its next flagship devices and many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1kz9g7v/pixel_devices_being_announced_at_the_end_of_jine/x">speculate</a> that this could hint at an early launch. The tech giant usually launches its flagship phones in August, so a pre-launch event in June could mean that official teasers and announcements are right around the corner.</p><p>As of now, invites for the pre-launch event appears to be limited to London, and it remains uncertain whether Google will hold similar events in other cities as well.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After receiving a tip about it, the post states the feature is rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 Beta 1. Appearing in the settings, Google says Advanced Protection "helps defend against online attacks, harmful apps, insecure connections, and other threats."</p><p>The initial welcome page breaks things down into two options: a toggle for Advanced Protection and an "Account Protection" for your Google Account. However, the company has included a "device protection features" button, which divulges everything Advanced Protection offers.</p><p>The publication discovered that the security feature protects users in six different ways. The first, Device Safety, keeps your phone safe if it's taken away from you and "blocks USB transfers." For apps, the feature will "prevent" apps from harming/corrupting your phone's memory for malicious purposes. Moreover, Advanced Protection will automatically force Chrome to only establish website connections for you if HTTPS is enabled.</p><p>Roaming with data becomes a little safer as the feature blocks 2G connections, only leaving enough space for emergency calls. Additionally, it will prevent your device from automatically connecting to Wi-Fi if it's not secure.</p><h2 id="safety-in-mind-2">Safety in Mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="qYpLu76g9ar2fbGHVCHfn9" name="android-16-advanced-protection-beta-enable" alt="A snapshot of Google's Advanced Protection "turn on" pop-up, which gives users bolstered defenses against a wide range of threats." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qYpLu76g9ar2fbGHVCHfn9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the publication notes, these features have existed on Android for a while, so Google's not bringing in any surprises.

This leads the publication to believe that Sony has completely moved away from manufacturing its Xperia phone in its own production facilities.</p><p>With this, it seems almost certain that Sony has opted to "outsource" the creation of its Xperia phone line to third-party companies. The publication mentions that Sony has done this before, just not with its flagship series. The Japanese OEM's mid-range devices have had their production outsourced for a while, but Sony has remained adamant (until now) to keep its Xperia close to heart.</p><p>Its research adds that not only has Sony removed all mentions of its smartphone devices from its official website, but sites from its overseas plants in Thailand and China have also dropped it.</p><p>While the future of Sony's Xperia line seems to fall on third-party sources, it's also reportedly looped in the Xperia 1 VII, per reports.</p><h2 id="the-latest-from-sony-2">The Latest from Sony</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg" name="sony-xperia-1-vii-01" alt="Sony Xperia 1 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sony's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony/sony-xperia-1-vii-goes-official-with-a-familiar-design-and-considerable-software-updates">Xperia 1 VII launched</a> earlier in May with a strong focus on its available camera selection. The phone features a triple camera array with a 52MP primary lens leading it off. This camera is joined by a 50MP secondary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens. Sony continued to feature its Alpha-powered tech and ZEISS for the cameras, as it has done with its previous generation.</p><p>Sony's flagship phones rock Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with a 6.5-inch display with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Another shining highlight for the Xperia 1 VII is Sony's software commitment. The company states the phone will receive four years of major OS upgrades and six years of security updates.</p><p>For now, the future of Sony's Xperia series seems relatively the same as before, barring the company continues development before leaning on third parties. However, the Japanese publication's report says there has been a rise in consumer concern about Sony's move. Some have questioned the future of the Xperia's quality, but only time will tell.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/thread/345608360/issue-fixed-repeated-pin-pattern-prompts-for-wear-os-payments" target="_blank">community post</a> Thursday, May 29, a Google employee confirmed the bug causing Wear OS devices to repeatedly ask for PIN/pattern authentication is fixed (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/30/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-fix/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Now, users can continue to make Wallet transactions without needing to authenticate their purchase every single time. After unlocking the smartwatch and keeping it strapped to your wrist, you can make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> contactless payments quickly and easily without entering your PIN or pattern.</p><p>The updated community post explains that some Wear OS users were "being asked to re-enter their PIN/password on their smartwatch during in-store payments." The company acknowledged the issue on May 20, and more than a week later, the patch is available.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, it was unclear whether this bug was a behavior change coinciding with an adjustment made to the way Google Wallet works on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a>. For smartphones, Google Wallet now needs to be unlocked with a passcode or biometrics for the app to be opened. While the emergence of the Wear OS bug seemed to line up with this tweak, it turned out to be a mistake after all.</p><p>Not all Wear OS users were affected by the problem, so if you haven't been dealing with repeated authentication prompts, you can continue using Google Wallet as normal. However, the issue seemed fairly widespread, as over 360 users reported having the same problem on the community post — and those are just the ones we know about.</p><p>To get the fix, make sure your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Wallet app</a> is updated to <strong>version 25.17</strong> on your Wear OS smartwatch.

The publication has supposedly come across the model numbers for the batteries en route to the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. The standout here is that the Ultra model is rumored to see quite a battery increase.</p><p>The post states the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra's battery is labeled model number EB-BX936ABY, and could bring the first battery capacity upgrade for the Ultra line. Supposedly, the battery sports a rated capacity of 11,374mAh, which would be 500mAh more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>. The publication suggests Samsung could stretch its advertised capacity to ~12,000mAh, but even that might be pushing it.</p><p>Elsewhere, details highlight the expected base Galaxy Tab S11 model, which could see an 8,160mAh battery.</p><h2 id="samsung-figures-out-its-galaxy-tab-2">Samsung figures out its Galaxy Tab</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">pretty early in the rumors</a> for Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 series; however, it seems consumers are in for another shakeup. The Korean OEM is reportedly only interested in debuting a Galaxy Tab S11 and a Tab S11 Ultra, no Plus model.

This is MediaTek's flagship chip that launched in October in preparation to take on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>When these devices could launch is still anyone's guess.

This name might sound familiar, especially if you're a Pokémon GO fan. Niantic reiterates its recent sale of its games division to Scopely. In short, the company is starting with roughly $250 million in its back pocket. As such, Niantic Spatial is turning onto a different road, one that will lead it toward a "large geospatial model."</p><p>Niantic Spatial states it will seek to bridge the gap between the "physical and digital worlds" through this geospatial fusion.</p><p>If all goes well, Niantic states its new model will facilitate better understanding and interactions between people and machines to "improve how we live and work." This large geospatial model has reportedly been developed using "over 30 billion posed images from millions of locations around the world." Niantic states this should aid LLMs (large language models) with spatial reasoning.</p><p>Essentially, these models (in theory) will be able to see/understand where something is in the physical world, and its real-world application to the space around it.</p><p>Niantic says that the issue with today's AI is that it's restricted to understanding "text, code, and images" only. Its geospatial model aims to break that open by creating a new "map" that enables these machines to understand our world the way we do.</p><h2 id="a-spatial-future-2">A Spatial Future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:594px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.01%;"><img id="3fM9UTZBoGYTeV6UyLQ62W" name="niantic-spatial-announcement" alt="Niantic Spatial foresees a future where the digital and physicals combine to better human life." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fM9UTZBoGYTeV6UyLQ62W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="594" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Niantic Spatial)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Niantic hopes to place its AI models in smaller devices like AR glasses; however, it also has set its sights on autonomous systems. The post also highlights the Niantic Spatial Platform, which consists of the Visual Positioning System, Gaussian Splatting (3D scanning/visualization), and developer SDKs. Niantic says it is working on deploying proof-of-concepts across various real-world areas.</p><p>Niantic's interest in AI isn't anything new, as its CEO, John Hanke, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/brilliant-labs-frame-smart-glasses-announcement">publicly backed a pair of smart glasses</a> from Brilliant Labs last year. Not only were these glasses light, but they could be outfitted with custom prescription lenses, too. Additionally, Brilliant Labs featured multimodal AI software for the device's front-facing spatial camera.</p><p>The company's AI, Noa, can hear and see the world around you.

It even told me that "it will be a single-page website," before rendering the page in a preview window for me to see.</p><p>After the site finished rendering, Gemini provided a brief explanation as to how it created the site, including the frameworks that it used.</p><h2 id="gemini-2-5-flash-preview-2">Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1439px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="hgcd2SCFxhgvX3oji6fLMZ" name="gemini-25-flash-preview-basic-prompt-2" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview results from basic prompt to create Android History website - error" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgcd2SCFxhgvX3oji6fLMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1439" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using the same prompt, I switched over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview</a> in AI Studio and was provided with something a bit different. I fed Gemini the same prompt, and was taken to a completely different dashboard. However, it didn't take long for me to realize that this is essentially a coding studio, as the middle pane shows the layout of various files. Meanwhile, the pane on the right is where I watched the code being generated by Gemini.</p><p>A few minutes later, I came back to my computer after grabbing some coffee and was met with an error message in the preview window. I have no clue what it was trying to fetch or why, and thankfully, I didn't need to. In the Code Assistant panel, there's a little button that says "Auto-fix." So obviously, I clicked on it and let Gemini fix its own code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="LRMQJhfHDgFhB46TnfdSPZ" name="gemini-25-flash-preview-basic-prompt-3" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview results from basic prompt to create Android History website" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRMQJhfHDgFhB46TnfdSPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1886" height="1061" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not only did it figure out what was wrong, but it also provided an explanation, along with the necessary fixes, and just started updating the code itself.

These sets of features are believed to be going away in September.</p><p>Google further suggests its users to save their current call history and messages and export them to Meet and has offered a step-by-step process on the corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/15226792?sjid=17473795407927261018-NC">support page</a>.</p><p>While some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/15226792?sjid=17473795407927261018-NC">legacy features are being removed</a>, some of them are upgraded in Google Meet in addition to a few more.

When all parties in the call are using the latest version of Meet with the update, they’ll see an in-app prompt explaining that they are now using the new calling experience. Otherwise, the call will default to the legacy calling experience. Once all users are using the updated Meet app, legacy calling will no longer be accessible.”</p><p>Users are recommended to stay on the latest version of the app and export the call history and video messages from the previous Legacy Duo app. As it is time to shift from legacy calls to new Meet calls. And it is finally encouraging to see the search giant utilizing a single <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet">Google Meet</a> for video calls and sole Google Messages with RCS unlike previous multiple apps which did the same thing.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, the full details are currently unclear, since these code strings haven't materialized into actionable or viewable notifications just yet.</p><p>Either way, it seems to be a good sign that Google is working on building a proper sleep timer for Google TV. Previously, Android TV's implementation of the feature required OEMs to build their own user-interfaces for the handy tool. Soon, Google TV users may be able to use convenient sleep timers to make sure their nighttime binges don't continue after their eyes close.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, the chip that will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in the U.S. is still unclear. Rumors and leaks have debated whether the flip-style foldable will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> or the Samsung Exynos 2500 for months. The conflicting reports seem to have only intensified as we slowly get closer to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's expected release window.</p><p>A report from the Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025052792731" target="_blank">Hank Yung</a> earlier this week claimed that Samsung will use a mix of Snapdragon and Exynos chips in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 depending on the region. For example, the publication cited the Snapdragon 8 Elite as being planned for the U.S. and Canada. In that case, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">Exynos 2500</a> could power the flip phone in most other regions.</p><p>Things got interesting when another report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> on Thursday, May 29 claimed the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will indeed be powered by the Exynos 2500 in the U.S. Specifically, SamMobile writes that "Galaxy Z Flip 7 firmware for the U.S. makes it pretty clear that the processor inside the phone is the Exynos 2500."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6  cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this leaves the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor up in the air. Aside from the above statement, SamMobile didn't provide any more details regarding the firmware evidence signaling the device will be powered by the Exynos 2500. Hank Yung similarly hasn't shared concrete evidence that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip will power the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in the U.S., either.</p><p>The dueling reports regarding the Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor mean that we don't know which chip will power the phone in which region. Usually, leaks and rumors provide clarity surrounding a smartphone launch. This time, it seems the Galaxy Z Flip 7's chip situation is getting more convoluted before it becomes clear.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

But the one thing you <em>cannot</em> control is the giant creature that serves as your physical manifestation on the planet.</p><p>Just as in the Black & White games, this creature is fueled by an artificial intelligence that is essentially a living being, experimenting with the world around it and learning as it goes. Like a pet, your encouragement or discipline will help shape this pet's personality and its understanding of morality, which will directly influence the people in the world around it.</p><p>The primary goal of the game is to inspire humans to worship you — either with grace or force — which, in turn, will increase your powers as a god. As humans visit shrines to worship you, they'll generate prayer power that you can collect and use to grow your powers. As your influence grows, so does your population's notoriety worldwide.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buFk2eK6kKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The game isn't a massive open world but, rather, a level-based strategy sandbox with a clear storyline bridging each locale together. As you and your citizens grow in influence, you'll come across enemies that want to bring you back down to size. Whether it's bandits that appear out of the fog of war or another civilization bent on war depends entirely on each scenario.</p><p>But while some of these features can be found in other games, the "virtual pet" portion of the game is unique among VR titles. It's your creature that makes How to God truly unique among Meta Quest strategy games and the thing that gives it the most character and intrigue, by far.</p><p>As a "living" creature's master, you must shape your pet to represent you in the best way since you can't micromanage it at all times. This isn't a Familiar that you summon on command, and it isn't a creature that you can just pick up and put wherever you want. It must be molded to properly represent you in the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF" name="how-to-god-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of How to God for the Meta Quest 3 showing villagers praying at an altar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Thoughtfish GmbH)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever trained a pet before, you'll know there are very different trains of thought.

Whether you choose to expand your village and earn praise or keep the population at bay by feeding your creature — thus inciting fearful prayers and power — is entirely up to you.</p><p>I also loved the game's alchemy system. Just like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/dimensional-double-shift-hexas-job-simulator-multiplayer">Job Simulator games</a>, How to God lets you grab different elements and combine them, like mixing fire and water to make steam. While it doesn't look nearly as intricate as those games, I'm eager to explore everything the developers have implemented, as I've been told there are dozens of combinations to be discovered.</p><p>The game is set to launch in the next few months as a single-player experience, but the developers have hinted that their goal is to eventually incorporate a multiplayer component.

Last month, an APK teardown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-messages-will-soon-use-color-to-differentiate-rcs-and-sms-mms-users">revealed color and text badges for RCS contacts</a> in the Google Messages app beta. It's now appearing widely for Google Messages beta testers, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/28/google-messages-new-chat-rcs/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>While the feature is still not available in the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, this expanded availability for beta testers signals it is nearing a public release. The tweak aims to make it easier to see whether a user is messaging someone using RCS messaging or old-school SMS/MMS messaging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS can be more secure and feature-rich than SMS or MMS</a>, delivering features like reactions, read receipts, and higher-quality video.</p><p>As such, it can be advantageous to know whether the chat you're starting is with someone using RCS or not. You might want to send a long video over RCS, but not over MMS. That's why a future update will add small RCS badges next to the contact names of people who have enabled the service, with no badge for SMS/MMS texters.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone">RCS tag is showing besides the RCS enabled phone numbers!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The change comes along with a new view for the <strong>New conversation</strong> page, which is now called <strong>New chat</strong>. Google Messages beta users will see this screen after tapping <strong>Start chat</strong>, and it'll eventually make its way to public users. RCS users will get Dynamic Color for their chats, serving as another visual cue separating new and old-school messaging options.</p><p>The update user-interface is appearing as part of Google Messages app beta <strong>version 20250527_01_RC00</strong>. While it's showing up more widely than before, it's still a limited rollout — likely occurring as a server-side push — exclusive to beta testers.</p><p>It's unclear when these UI tweaks for Google Messages will roll out for everyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53546025&_gl=1*1ev768s*_ga*MTg5NTcwNDAxMC4xNzMzNTA5MTY1*_ga_541ENG1F9X*czE3NDg1MjQ4NjYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4NTI0ODc3JGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">new report released</a> by IDC today (May 29), global smartphone sales are now predicted to grow only by 0.6% overall in 2025.</p><p>“Since April 2nd, the smartphone industry has faced a whirlwind of uncertainty. While current exemptions on smartphones have offered temporary relief, the looming possibility of broader tariffs presents a serious risk,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><p>The global market intelligence firm said that it had to lower its earlier prediction of 2.3% that it made in February, due to the high uncertainty around fluctuating tariffs, economic challenges, "such as inflation and unemployment across many regions leading to a slowdown in consumer spending."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.08%;"><img id="uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3" name="IDC-phone-sales-2025-forecast" alt="IDC Decreases its Worldwide Smartphone Forecast to 0.6% for 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="488" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report also states that smartphone sales will continue to remain low for the next five years, and may see single-digit growth, averaging at 1.4%. Several factors could cause this, and the firm attributes it to people retaining their phones for longer periods, and an increasing trend of buying refurbished smartphones instead of new ones, as they can be lighter on the pocket.</p><p>Furthermore, IDC's report claims that despite the ongoing tensions between China and the U.S., the two countries will be the major contributors to the said growth of 0.6% of smartphone sales.</p><p>"The US Market is forecast to grow 1.9% in 2025, but it was impacted from the ongoing US-China trade war as growth was pulled down from 3.3% due to increased uncertainty and tariff related price increases,” said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1877" height="1056" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android phone sales in China are said to increase by 3% YoY, due to the increase in government subsidies and discounts to push smartphone sales. Which is why Apple could see a 1.9% decline in sales as Huawei takes the spotlight.</p><p>Lastly, the firm notes that recent signals from the U.S. on a potential tariff hike on smartphones have only made the future uncertain for OEMs outside the U.S., with smartphone vendors who export to the U.S. having to deal with unnecessary geopolitics. As the Trump administration was recently levying 25% on phones built outside the U.S.</p><p>"Despite these headwinds, India and Vietnam are expected to remain the key alternatives to China for smartphone production,” Popal added.</p><p>However, it is important to note that earlier today, the U.S. Court of International Trade judges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">ruled to halt</a> President Trump's recent 10% tariffs on "virtually every U.S. trade partner." The judges state that the administration's leverage of the IEEPA shouldn't qualify here, and that Trump has "exceeded" any rightful authority.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the real headline is that it's locking in your rates for talk, text, and data for a full five years.</p><p>The new plans, namely Experience More ($85/month) and Experience Beyond ($100), are stepping in to replace the old Go5G Next and Go5G Plus. As for the regular Go5G plan, it's also getting the boot.</p><p>Business users are getting some extra love too with the new Experience More for Business and Experience Beyond for Business plans. The big perk is free access to Secure Wi-Fi, which is a smart VPN that kicks in automatically whenever you’re on sketchy public networks.</p><h2 id="travel-and-data-perks-2">Travel and data perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF" name="t-mobile-logo-google-pixel-8-pro.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile Logo on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile's Experience More plan also packs unlimited talk, text, and data, along with free Netflix plan (standard tier) and Apple TV Plus thrown in. The carrier has upped the ante with 60GB hotspot data (that's 10GB more than before). When traveling, you'll get 15GB high-speed in Canada/Mexico and 5GB in over 215 countries.</p><p>One cool new thing with the Experience More plan is that it's adding satellite coverage, something the old Go5G Next didn’t have. This starts in July and stays free through the end of 2025. After that, if you want to keep the satellite service, it’ll run you $15 a month.</p><p>On the other hand, the premium Experience Beyond plan keeps satellite coverage free, with no end date in sight. You're also scoring a massive 250GB of hotspot data. It keeps the same Netflix and Apple TV Plus perks as Experience More, plus throws in Hulu with Ads as an extra bonus.</p><h2 id="business-boost-2">Business boost</h2><p>In a big win for business users, the Experience Beyond for Business plan cranks hotspot data up to 300GB. It’s built to keep remote teams and on-the-go offices connected without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Both plans throw in phone upgrade options—Experience More lets you switch it up every couple of years, while Experience Beyond lets you refresh your phone once a year.</p><p>The cool part is you get free T-Satellite with Starlink until the end of 2025. It hooks your phone up directly to satellites, so you can text even where there’s no cell signal at all.</p><p>T-Mobile says you just need a clear patch of sky to use the new T-Satellite with Starlink.

The company's data shows that the top 10 phones in this past quarter have retained "stable" overall global sales. However, Android phones are only present for spots five through nine. Interestingly, four of the top Android phones from Q1 are budget, Samsung Galaxy A series devices.</p><p>In fifth place is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Galaxy A16 5G</a>, followed by the Galaxy A06. According to the data, the former experienced a 17% YoY (year-over-year) growth, likely due to its North American launch on January 2. This took place a couple of weeks before Samsung's major flagship reveal, and that's where Counterpoint's research takes us next. Specifically, we're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is the only one of Samsung's recent flagships to break the top 10 best-selling phones.</p><p>The S25 Ultra comes in at seventh place, leaving the Redmi 14C 4G and the Galaxy A55 6G to round out the bunch.</p><p>Elsewhere, Apple's iPhones take the top four spots, which sees the base iPhone 16 taking #1. It's then followed by its other 16 series siblings, the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro.</p><p>Regarding sales, Counterpoint highlights devices under $100, stating phones in that category became the "fastest growing" in Q1 2025.</p><h2 id="this-time-last-year-2">This time last year...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Counterpoint adds the Galaxy S25 Ultra's placement in Q1 2025 is slightly lower than the fifth spot held by the S24 Ultra last year. The post attributes this change to the S25's "shorter sales window" in Q1. Despite that, Counterpoint's research shows the entire series has delivered "steady results" for Samsung in the year's initial quarter.</p><p>If we take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">a look back at Q1 2024</a>, Samsung reclaimed its top spot for most shipped phones. Research indicated that the Korean OEM's performance was due to the popularity of its Galaxy A series from late 2023 into the next year. We're seeing a similar trend now, thanks to the recent Galaxy A16 5G launch at the start of 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, Counterpoint foresaw the premium smartphone market's growth in 2024 because of AI advancements and features on those phones. Currently, the company's report highlighted the Galaxy S25's inclusion of Google's Gemini, stating this "signals Samsung’s shift toward a more agentic AI experience, enhancing user productivity and personalization."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Per reports, the tariffs were reportedly 10% and concerned "virtually every U.S. trade partner."The U.S. Court said on Wednesday, May 28, that the tariffs have been considered illegal due to them "exceeding" the president's rightful authority.</p><p>The publication cites the judges, surfacing the following statement: "The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder."</p><p>The IEEPA, otherwise known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, is the primary catalyst here. The president's administration has leaned on the IEEPA to "justify" its recent 10% tariffs on many overseas trade partners. What's more, a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, defended the 10% tariffs, stating the U.S. "trade deficit" with other countries has "created a national emergency that has decimated American communities."</p><p>However, the U.S. Court claims the IEEPA's true intention is to rectify any trade imbalances, not emergency action.</p><p>CBS News states the Trump Administration plans to appeal the court's roadblock.

This is not a pre-installed app with system-wide permissions; it's an app you installed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play" target="_blank">Play Store</a> or App Store, presumably <em>after</em> reading the privacy policy and understanding how your data is collected and used, and being okay with it.</p><p>Of course, nothing said "<em>Hey, we're going to record your screen, is that OK</em>?" but the store listings <strong>do</strong> tell you how your private information will be collected, but not shared. That's all T-Mobile needs to do, and what allows the company to build an app that records your screen the first time you use it and until you turn the feature off. It isn't recording anything outside the app (it can't), and it has an explanation for why it needs this information. Its bases are covered 100%.</p><p>But it still feels wrong. It leads to my real question: <em><strong>why</strong></em> is this allowed to happen?</p><h2 id="blame-apple-and-google-2">Blame Apple and Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze" name="hey-google-logo-ces-2018-2.jpg" alt="A Google Logo at CES" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recording or otherwise <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-record-screen-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">capturing the contents of your screen</a> isn't anything new, and I think everyone has done it once or twice, at least. It can be useful for both you and for quality control from the developers and providers of an app or service. I'm not opposed to the idea on any level, and I don't think anyone should be; it's just another feature.</p><p>Where I think issues come into play is that this happens without asking. <strong>There is no way you can use the app and turn the setting off without it happening</strong>, so having a setting means little when it's enabled by default. I do not care that the only information you provide while using the app is captured, or that T-Mobile doesn't share any of it with any other party.</p><p>I care that it is enabled by default. I <em>really</em> care that Apple and Google have no problem allowing, nay, enabling this behavior. Two companies that constantly crow about your privacy and how they protect you and your data, pretending to be some sort of benevolent benefactor and a shield between you and the "bad guy."</p><div><blockquote><p>The problem isn't that T-Mobile is recording your screen; it's that this feature is enabled by default.</p></blockquote></div><p>The reality is a lot simpler and sinister: Google and Apple only care about Google and Apple, T-Mobile only cares about T-Mobile, and you have to care about yourself and your privacy. I'm very skeptical about any sort of "privacy initiatives" from huge tech companies (and often very vocal about that), but I can't see any other explanation, especially now that this has been talked about for a week.</p><p>Someone at Apple and Google has likely been made aware, and so far, no action has been taken.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4" name="Pixel-9-home-screen" alt="Pixel 9 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My complaining about policies that permit this isn't going to change anything either. A simple outcome is for T-Mobile to change one variable in the app's code from true to false, rebuild it, and send out a mandatory update.

What the publication observed was still brief; however, its context details the AI's features.</p><p>In a jab at the old Assistant, Google says Gemini will be "a more capable and conversational assistant."</p><p>The company teased a few of its capabilities, like options to "create a customized playlist, send messages, and more."

Most of what we "know" is similar in style to what Google's just teased in its I/O 2025 recap. Users <em>should </em>be able to converse back and forth with Gemini for assistance and to enable it to complete tasks without much manual human input.</p><p>Of course, Gemini's Wear OS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">takeover will push the Assistant out</a>, but that's not surprising to anyone anymore.</p><p>I/O 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6#section-gemini-on-wear-os">kind of skipped over</a> any huge Gemini/Wear OS mentions; however, Google promised it would arrive "in the coming months." What we're still curious about is whether or not this update will coincide with Wear OS 6's launch or if it'll stand alone. The AI is expected to remain similar to Assistant in the way that users summon it. Users may still retain the "Hey Google" command to produce Gemini when it arrives.</p><p>What's more, there's speculation that Pixel Watch 3 users can hold its side button to produce the AI, too.

If the leaked design is real, it will be a fusion of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch Ultra, with a rotating bezel sitting atop the squircle case. And whether you love the change or resent the switch, there's reason to be a bit concerned.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-renders-360-video-5k-leaked/">the leak</a>, the Watch 8 Classic will feature a 1.5-inch display, a 435mAh battery capacity, and dimensions of 46 x 46.5 x 14.2mm. We don't have any information on weight, but whether it uses steel or titanium, it's not hard to guess that it could be one of the heaviest Android watches we've seen.</p><p>Remember, Samsung consistently fudges the thickness of its watches by excluding the sensor bump from the calculation, as if it were somehow removable or optional. The Galaxy Watch 7 is "9.7mm" thick but actually measures about 12.7mm. Likewise, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is closer to 15.5mm than its 12.1mm estimate.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kc93PvsHI_8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Now hit the video above and pause at the one- or seven-second mark. Is this watch actually 14.2mm thick? If you take the "12mm" Ultra case and add a 2mm-thick rotating bezel, that would make sense. But then the <em>actual</em> thickness would be closer to 17mm, which would dwarf every smartwatch I've ever worn.</p><p>All of this is nothing more than speculation until we try on the Watch 8 Classic in person or get official specs to confirm the weight. However, I believe this leak because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> have been trending this way.</p><h2 id="this-classic-isn-t-made-for-normal-smartwatch-fans-anymore-2">This 'Classic' isn't made for 'normal' smartwatch fans anymore</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-scaled" alt="A render of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, with a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My mom comments on my "spaceship watches" whenever I visit her while reviewing a new watch. To her, they look like an object perched on my wrist, rather than an accessory. By this metric, the Watch 8 Classic would be a true Millennium Falcon.</p><p>Let's give Samsung the benefit of the doubt, for now, that it's not as thick as this leak suggests. It's still a fair guess that the Watch 8 Classic has a 46mm titanium case with a stainless steel bezel atop it.

Same goes for the bulky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, which uses Samsung's trick to "measure" 11.8mm thick without the sensor.</p><p>They all appeal to diehard Android users, but scare off the more mainstream audience that buys light, thin, and cheap squircle watches.</p><p>If you don't believe me, I held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> last Christmas with my extended family, and while my non-techie family members liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for their distinct style, they <em>hated</em> the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra.

But will people buy it?</p><p>The above leak claims the Watch 8 Classic will have a 435mAh rated capacity, or 450mAh typical capacity. That's a very slight bump over the 425mAh Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 6 Classic; it's also well short of the 590mAh Galaxy Watch Ultra or Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>Heavy watches usually deliver better-than-average battery life or other perks. But if the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic brings back the same 40-hour estimate, the same 1.5-inch display, and (likely) the same Exynos chip and 2GB of RAM as last year's model, then what's the justification to buy a watch that big?</p><p>That said, I have skewed tastes, and I do think the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (as leaked) looks pretty cool! I resented using the digital touch bezel on the Ultra, making the return of the physical bezel with exact controls all the more appealing. But the weight and thickness could be deal-breakers for long-time Classic buyers.</p><p>So, as we wait until late July for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, I'm hoping we'll eventually get some additional context to make the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sound a bit less... intimidating.</p><hr><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The process should further comprise a scanning of a QR code on the Android phone — in a similar manner as seen on eSIM transfer between current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200-06" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since it is happening on an iPhone, the QR code process is said to be involving the user to enter a “session ID” and a “passcode” on the Android device — both generated by the iPhone. Furthermore, the strings also mention that if two devices aren’t able to connect wirelessly, it could mean the iPhone isn’t running iOS 19 or later, which is an indication that the feature could possibly ship with the next iOS version.</p><p>Speaking of, it is scheduled to be unveiled at WWDC (June 9-13) this year with the next version of iOS. While it is probably called iOS 19, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/apple-to-rebrand-device-operating-systems-ios-26-macos-26-watchos-26?srnd=undefined">latest Bloomberg report</a> suggests Apple is revamping the entire operating system lineup and it will be called iOS 26 instead. Regardless, the new feature should help users avoid the need to reach out to carriers to transfer their eSIMs between iPhone and Android devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>In a recent "Sharing Session," AYANEO provided more details about its upcoming Pocket S2 handheld.</li><li>This included a better look at the design, along with some of the various features and capabilities.</li><li>The AYANEO Pocket S2 will soon be available for pre-order from Indiegogo, but pricing has yet to be revealed.</li></ul><p>It's been about two and a half months since we first caught wind of the AYANEO Pocket S2, when it was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">GDC 2025</a>. Now, we're finally learning more about what the handheld is expected to offer in terms of both the design and performance.</p><p>The original announcement came alongside Qualcomm's introduction of three new gaming-focused chipsets, headlined by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3. This is the successor to the G3x Gen 2 that was announced in August 2023, with AYANEO being the only company to actually use it in a device. After it initially arrived with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, AYANEO has since used the G3x Gen 2 in four different handhelds, most recently, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ace-pre-orders-open-ahead-of-next-months-launch">Pocket ACE</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4Uty2BPNs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Much like its predecessor and the Gen 2, the Pocket S2 will be the first device to make use of the G3 Gen 3. During the Sharing Session, we got a better look at the aluminum and glass chassis, complete with sides that are more rounded. This should hopefully quell any issues for those, like myself, who found the original Pocket S to be uncomfortable during longer playing sessions.</p><p>The Pocket S2 remedies another problem from the original, thanks to the fan cutout on the back plate. This, paired with the "fishbone biomimetic air outlet" along the top, will hopefully prevent any potential thermal throttling.</p><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong></strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>AYANEO Pocket S2</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch IPS, 2560 x 1440, 600 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>UFS 3.1 / UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Extras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>RGB Joysticks, Hall Triggers, TMR Electromagnetic Joysticks, Micro-switch D-pad & ABXY buttons</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian Black, IceSoul White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>One of the more impressive aspects of the Pocket S2 is the battery, as AYANEO managed to pack an 8,000mAh battery into this sleek chassis. It's not completely unheard of, as AYN's Odin 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal</a> both feature batteries of the same size. However, both of those handhelds are larger and thicker than the S2.</p><p>Something else that was rather intriguing is that the Pocket S2 apparently "supports Turnip Driver Out of the Box." For the unaware, these are graphics created by the community that are designed to improve performance and compatibility in a variety of emulators.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HcV6JR9pkvCaW5CQBboHcd" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-turnip-driver-support-banner" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 Turnip Driver support banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HcV6JR9pkvCaW5CQBboHcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm interested to see just how AYANEO is implementing this into the software of the Pocket S2. Not every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulator</a> includes support for third-party drivers, so I can't help but wonder if that means we'll run into issues if the drivers are implemented on a system level.</p><p>Sadly, AYANEO didn't provide any details regarding the price of the Pocket S2, so we'll have to see how much of a dent this will put in our wallets. However, we do have a landing page for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-s2-6-3-screen-snapdragon-g3-gen3-handheld/coming_soon">Indiegogo campaign</a>, where you can register to be notified when pre-orders are live.

Infinix in particular saw a lot of success with its GT series of devices over the last two years; I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-gt-10-pro-review">GT 10 Pro</a>, and the GT 20 Pro built on that foundation.</p><p>The GT 30 Pro was just announced, and the phone is all set to make its debut in India. Ahead of its global launch, I had an email interaction with Infinix's Product Director Weiqi Nie to get a better sense of what the brand is doing differently this time around, and how it is positioning the GT series.</p><p>Design has always been a key selling point of previous GT models, and Infinix has doubled down in that area with the GT 30 Pro. The phone has a "cyber-mecha" design aesthetic that looks plain cool, and while the GT 10 Pro looked like a derivative of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Nothing's phones</a>, that is definitely not the case with the GT 30 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nie noted that Infinix took inspiration from "futuristic machines and modular aesthetics" in designing the device. "Over time, this concept has evolved to be more expressive, functional, and aligned with the needs of modern gamers. In the GT 30 Series, this vision comes to life through the upgraded Mechanical Light Waves system. Built on deep integration between software and hardware design, it delivers 14 lighting scenarios and over 20 customizable effects that respond dynamically to actions like charging, gaming, and notifications."</p><p>Infinix basically wanted to deliver a phone with a bold design, and thanks to the custom pattern at the back and vibrant lighting, the GT 30 Pro manages to stand out quite a bit. Of course, while design is a consideration, the biggest factor when choosing a gaming phone is the performance.</p><p>Infinix went with MediaTek instead of Qualcomm, and Nie said the Dimensity 8350 offered the brand the ideal mix of high frame rate gaming and thermal management. "MediaTek’s platform offered the right combination of performance, efficiency, and scalability to bring the GT 30 Pro’s vision to life. The Dimensity 8350 Ultimate delivers smooth high-frame-rate gaming, effective thermal control, and optimized power usage—crucial for maintaining consistent performance across both gaming and daily use."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="4500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"The Dimensity 8350 Ultra's capabilities provided the performance headroom needed to integrate features like a 144Hz AMOLED display, advanced cooling solutions, and responsive gaming enhancements, without compromising on price accessibility. This approach allows the GT 30 Pro to deliver a flagship-level experience that is designed for a broader range of users."</p><p>Overheating continues to be an issue on gaming phones, with this year's Qualcomm chipsets in particular having a higher thermal threshold. Thankfully, that isn't the case with MediaTek designs, and Nie said sustained performance is a "core priority" on the GT 30 Pro, particularly during longer gaming sessions. The GT 30 Pro features Infinix’s 3D Vapor Cloud Chamber (3D VCC) liquid cooling tech, and Nie noted that the brand does "intelligent software optimization that dynamically manages power and thermal behavior based on real-time usage."</p><p>There are two accessories as well — the MagCase and MagCharge Cooler — with the latter being an active cooling solution that funnels cool air to the back of the device. "The GT 30 Pro takes a system-level approach—combining a high-performance chipset, efficient cooling, and smart charging solutions such as Bypass Charging 2.0 and optimized wireless charging with active cooling. This ensures stable, high frame rates over long periods, without overheating or throttling—even while charging."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be testing the GT 30 Pro's prowess in this regard, and having used other MediaTek mid-range designs, I'm excited to see what the phone brings to the table. The GT 30 Pro also retains ultrasonic triggers, allowing gamers to assign in-game actions with relative ease — they make a genuine difference while gaming.</p><p>The phone gets a 144Hz panel, and what I like the most is that it unlocks 120fps in demanding titles including PUBG Mobile. Like other brands catering to this niche, the GT 30 Pro is aimed at a younger audience, and the design and visual aesthetic reflects that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Infinix is focused on phones, Nie said the brand is looking to build an ecosystem of gaming devices under the "GT Verse" umbrella. "GT Verse is a full-stack experience designed around the needs of mobile gamers. In addition to the GT 30 Pro, the lineup is expanding with GT Buds 4 with 30dB ANC and low-latency Game Mode, the GT Power bank with 55W multi-device fast charging, and even a dedicated cooling accessory under development."</p><p>"This ecosystem approach allows users to stay connected, powered, and immersed across devices—whether they’re gaming at home or on the move. While future product plans will be guided by community feedback and innovation readiness, the GT Series will remain at the core of Infinix’s long-term vision to serve gamers with purpose-built tools across categories."</p><p>Pricing is a big part of what makes a budget gaming phone succeed, and Infinix is targeting a $300 price point with the device. Given that there aren't that many gaming-focused phones in this category, the aggressive positioning combined with the feature-set of the device should allow the GT 30 Pro to win out against its rivals. With an imminent launch in India, we don't have to wait too long to know more about the GT 30 Pro, and I'll have more to share on the device in the coming days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it took seemingly <em>forever</em> to start up in One UI 7 and got quite irritating to use on a regular basis.</p><p>That's been completely fixed in One UI 8. It used to take roughly 5 seconds from tapping the "AI Select" button to the time you could actually select content on your screen. Now, tapping AI select makes the feature effectively immediately available, taking me about 2 seconds to circle an image on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display.</p><h2 id="multitasking-is-90-10-better-2">Multitasking is 90:10 better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3" name="one-ui-8-multitasking-improvements-split-screen" alt="Using the new 90:10 multitasking feature on One UI 8 and Android 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> came out in 2023, it blew our minds for several reasons, but the phone's multitasking capabilities were among the best features to use daily. Paramount to that was something called OnePlus Canvas, a feature that let you dock an app to 10% of one side of the screen and quickly switch between any running app by tapping the window.</p><p>Android 16 and One UI 8 have adopted this 90:10 feature, as it's called, letting you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size. This lets you easily juggle two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is squashed, as normal split screen tends to feel. Holy cow is it ever a massive upgrade on the normal split window multitasking, and it'll give me a reason to finally use more than one app at a time.</p><h2 id="quick-share-got-some-quicker-tweaks-2">Quick Share got some quicker tweaks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-quick-share" alt="Comparing the Quick Share UI between One UI 7 and One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quick Share has been one of the most useful additions to Android in quite some time, but receiving files from people who aren't contacts has been a bit of a hassle. A fancy new UI change from Samsung makes this much easier, and it all starts when you tap the Quick Share button in the quick toggles pane.</p><p>The familiar Send screen is still the default when opening Quick Share, but a new Receive tab makes it simple to quickly get files from anyone so long as the window is open. No more selecting from the "no one, contacts only, or everyone" options. Just open the Receive window and you're good to go, no matter who the other person is.</p><h2 id="more-powerful-reminders-and-routines-2">More powerful reminders and routines</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-reminders-app" alt="Comparing the changes in the Reminders app between One UI 8 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the dumber things Google ever did was remove the ability to add a location to reminders in Google Assistant.

The upgraded Reminders app now also includes quick category buttons at the top, making it easy to find everything you need at a glance.</p><p>Routines also got an upgrade, now letting you select from new preset routines like weather, which is pretty slick if you need a reminder to grab your umbrella or rain coat before it rains, or sunscreen when the cloudy days end.</p><h2 id="samsung-health-gets-a-bulk-up-2">Samsung Health gets a bulk up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time, I tried to log my food intake so I could track calories, macros, and just do better. The problem is that I always forgot to input my meals, and wouldn't remember until I had forgotten the exact details of what I ate. Now, Samsung Health can remind you to log meals throughout the day, circumventing this common problem.</p><p>As you eat better, you can also now use the power of peer pressure to help you workout more often. An upgraded Together feature in Samsung Health lets you issue run distance challenges to all your contacts, setting goals to be the first to run a specific distance each week. It's a great upgrade on the usual step count race.</p><h2 id="the-better-to-see-and-hear-you-with-2">The better to see (and hear) you with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-accessibility-zooming" alt="Using the upgraded zoom accessibility feature in One UI 8 to see an Android 16 logo on the Android Central website up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever found yourself in need of the zoom tool, found in accessibility settings, you'll know it's a little convoluted to zoom in or out with.

We don't need big overhauls every release. It's just not necessary. So, Samsung is focused on making One UI 7 even better with helpful features and changes that seem to make a lot of sense. Even the weather app, seen above, has a more realistic feel, giving you a better idea of the weather the moment you open it.</p><p>Some users on Reddit have reported bugs already, which makes sense since this is a beta release. If you want to check out One UI 8 early, open the Samsung Members app on your Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, or Galaxy S25 Ultra, then tap the One UI 8 Beta option in the image carousel at the top. Once you're enrolled, it'll download and install the system update. We don't recommend doing this on your only phone, as bugs could cause problems for any number of apps.</p><p>If you come across a bug, use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshoot/TSG10003603/">bug reporting tool</a> to let the developers know so that they can get it fixed in the next beta release. This helps everyone — not just you — so users are encouraged to use the tool as often as possible, even if Samsung knows the bug already exists. This is Samsung's fastest One UI update ever, and it's great to see Samsung working so hard to deliver on that seven year update promise for the Galaxy S25 series so quickly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Numbers are displayed in a flipboard-style format, and you can click or tap a number to read the corresponding fact from the I/O keynote. It's a neat way to recap what you missed from the event, and get a glimpse of how Gemini can be used as a coding agent.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.17%;"><img id="wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-2" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4448" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.35%;"><img id="69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-1" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4436" height="2278" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since you're exploring the Gemini web app directly in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">Canvas</a>, you can play around with the preview of the web app itself or view the code used to create it.

When clicking Gemini's starry icon, its side panel will now display a text box detailing the "summarized content." Users can interact with this drop-down menu for quick bites of information without having to sit through a lengthy video.</p><p>However, summarizing a video's content isn't all Gemni is capable of in this patch.</p><p>Google highlights the AI model's ability to list "action items" from a video. Action items are direct calls for you (the viewer) to do something. Google uses the example of a planning video, which tells the user to finalize a campaign schedule and secure a location for its "spring pop-up." If Gemini detects things like this, it will list them under the "list action items" function in the side panel.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini's newfound video capabilities pave the way for specific user questions. You can ask the AI to list any video highlights and more, depending on the context of the video.</p><h2 id="gemini-in-workspace-continues-2">Gemini in Workspace Continues</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.11%;"><img id="LovNCCgtPnZ5mTykhGEwsa" name="google-drive-gemini-action-items-example" alt="Google Drive's Gemini update brings the ability for users to tell the AI to list "action items" from within a video without the user needing to watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LovNCCgtPnZ5mTykhGEwsa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="966" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect, this feature is rolling out for Google Workspace customers.

When it comes to folders in Drive, sometimes there's just too much to go through. Gemini comes into play, offering its insightful summarization function for folders, documents, and spreadsheets. Users summoning Gemini can use the "@" symbol to direct Gemini to a specific folder, i.e., "summarize the files in @AndroidCentral."</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-feature-drop-rolled-out-with-gemini-inclusion">a huge Workspace Drop</a> occurred earlier this year, which saw Gemini spread across Google's apps like mad.

You've heard of them even if you didn't know it; companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cricket-unlimited-adds-hbo-max-ads-its-unlimited-plan-free">Cricket Wireless</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mint-mobile-reduces-rates-to-dollar15-per-month-with-a-deflation-initiative">Mint Mobile</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-fi/google-fi-wireless-celebrates-10-years-with-a-new-affordable-plan">Google Fi</a> are all MVNOs.</p><p>What that really means is that they lease giant amounts of usage rights from bigger carriers with actual infrastructure like towers and cables in place. Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, for example. It's a separate company, but it runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvnos-use-t-mobiles-network" target="_blank">T-Mobile's</a> U.S. network, with many agreements outside of the U.S., allowing it to operate almost anywhere in the world.</p><p>The agreement means they are sort of like you, a customer of a major cellular carrier. Of course, they do things a lot differently and use a lot more of the network than you or I ever will.</p><p>Things get a little murky with some of these arrangements. What I mean is that a physical network carrier like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> can also run an MVNO that uses its network (in this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a>).</p><p>The company books are kept separately, and there are different plans and rules, but the big company also owns the small company. I don't know why they choose this route versus offering different plans with similar pricing, but I'm sure it's a wise business decision. Carriers are <em>really</em> good at those.</p><h2 id="so-what-s-the-difference-2">So what's the difference?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM" name="visible-sim-galaxy-s20-angle-wide.jpg" alt="Visible SIM card Galaxy S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While they seem to be duplicates of each other, they really aren't. There are three major differences between an MVNO and a "regular" carrier.</p><p>The first one, and what you might have read about on the internet, is that an MVNO can offer service at much cheaper rates. In some cases, prices are almost cut in half for what sounds like the same service plan on the same network. That's kind of true, but you need to know about the other two differences as well.</p><p>Next is the difference in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-access-visible-customer-support">customer service</a>. Now I'm not saying that big carriers like AT&T or Orange offer excellent customer service, but they do offer more help than you'll get from a typical MVNO. Cutting back on customer support staff is one of the ways that an MVNO can offer such cheap service. They won't leave you high and dry, but don't expect expert answers for every question you might have or a quick solution to every problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg" name="T-Mobile-store-logo.jpg" alt="T-Mobile store logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, we have to talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/when-do-carriers-start-throttling-you-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">network deprioritization</a>. What sounds like a made-up word is a real thing, and it happens frequently in some places. When a network location gets really crowded and it starts to affect the quality of your connection, MVNO customers take a backseat to customers of the parent network.</p><p>I know that sounds confusing, so here's a real-world example of it in action: I use Google Fi for my carrier, but until recently, my wife used T-Mobile. Google Fi uses the T-Mobile network, so coverage and quality are the same 99% of the time. The one percent difference? If we take a trip to downtown D.C. for any sort of event, like seeing the cherry blossoms or for the July 4 fireworks show, my phone service sucks.</p><p>T-Mobile customers have priority when it comes to using the network, and MVNO customers, like me and my Google Fi phone, get to use what's left over. When it's super crowded and people are densely packed into a smaller area, your MVNO carrier connection can suffer. It's a real thing, even though you won't see it very often.</p><h2 id="should-you-use-one-or-should-you-stick-with-the-big-companies-2">Should you use one or should you stick with the big companies?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC" name="verizon-warehouse-logo.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in warehouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>If you make the switch to an MVNO, you will save money, that's for sure. But you need to be aware of and OK with the drawbacks.</p><p>Are you the type of person who doesn't want to hassle with problems? If you would rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-att-customer-phone-walk-in-repairs">carry your phone into the carrier store</a> and let them fix whatever is wrong, then an MVNO might not be for you.</p><p>A bigger issue is the coverage. I live way out in the suburbs and never see any depriorization issues in my day-to-day life. But as mentioned, they are there, and it does happen. If you live or work somewhere like Manhattan or Los Angeles, you might not get the quality of service you want when you use an MVNO, especially during peak times when people are using their mobile devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV" name="mint-mobile-16-9.jpg" alt="Mint Mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mint Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you<em> really</em> need to do is try it for yourself. All MVNOs offer a month-to-month service plan, and many even allow you a risk-free trial for just this purpose. Don't shut off your current service, but order a SIM card from any of the popular MVNOs that seem like a good fit and give it a try. If you can test under the worst conditions, like a holiday or during a sporting event, even better. Make sure you have service when and where you're going to need it.</p><p>If it doesn't work for you, that's OK. You can always try again next year, because the improvements carriers make to their networks also benefit the MVNOs that use their infrastructure.</p><p>If it does work, and you're okay with being your own first level of support, you can save yourself a significant amount of money.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, the company may be looking to fit these superb camera sensors into a smaller package for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. Samsung is planning to use an inkjet printing process to manufacturer thinner Galaxy S26 Ultra lenses, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36403" target="_blank">The Elec</a> (translated to English).</p><p>A company subdivision, called Samsung Electro-Mechanics, is tasked with creating camera lenses for Galaxy devices, and will reportedly switch to the inkjet printing process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/05/new-camera-optics-could-make-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-than-s25.html">Android Headlines</a>).</p><p>Currently, The Elec reports that Samsung uses film layers within camera lenses to reduce lighting issues during capture, like lens flare and ghosting. The extra layers add to the camera lens' overall thickness, which could be reduced if the film was swapped with a printed layer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-camera-islands-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inkjet printing process serves as a slimmer alternative to traditional lens films. It involves putting matte ink directly on the part of the camera lens known as the "rib" — this is the portion of the camera housing that takes in light from the lenses, pushing it towards the actual camera sensors. With less space needed between the lenses and the sensor, the camera housing as a whole can become more compact.</p><p>According to The Elec's report, Samsung previously shared this technology in a patent application in 2018, but it didn't end up being officially registered and patented.</p><p>With a thinner camera lens, it's possible that Samsung could reduce the size of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>'s camera bump. The company could also use the extra space to house bigger components, like a larger battery, but a smaller protrusion for the camera lenses is most likely. These reports are currently unconfirmed, so we'll have to wait until the Samsung Galaxy S26 is officially announced to know which changes are coming to the phone's camera system for certain.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-10-years-tips-tricks/">blog post</a>, Google brought out the birthday cake and two gifts (updates) to keep Photos on its A-game. To mark a decade, Google Photos is set to receive an updated, redesigned in-app editor. The post states this new editor will offer "AI-powered suggestions" when sprucing up your photos.</p><p>More than that, these suggestions will combine several of Google Photos' available AI editing tools for "quick edits." Users can browse through these suggested actions and see if they like the result. However, if you're more interested in one particular part of a photo, Google says you can tap on specific parts and still receive AI editing suggestions.</p><p>This update will hit Android in June, leaving iOS users to wait until "later this year."</p><p>The second update, though small, breathes new life into sharing Google Photos albums with QR codes. Rolling out today, users can "generate QR codes" to share with people nearby. Those scanning your code can view the album or add pictures.</p><h2 id="photos-extravaganza-2">Photos Extravaganza</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeeWLu2zMq8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google slips in a few tips to keep Photos users on the ball, like the ability to hide certain people or places from Memories. To do this, the post instructs users to head into <strong>Photos > Settings > Preferences > Memories</strong>. From there, dates, people, and even pets can be hidden so you're not thrust into sad moments or moments of longing. Additionally, Google reminds users that they can search in Photos using keywords.</p><p>The app will be able to leverage your gallery to find instances of you in a dress or even you at a sporting event.</p><p>Google drops some analytical knowledge, touting that Photos has roughly 1.5 billion users every month, and over 9 trillion stored photos and videos.</p><p>Google Photos has had a couple of notable updates in the past year, like the patch that brought the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections</a>" tab. This area replaced the app's old library, giving users a more intuitive, clean look at their albums, documents, and more. The update included a small change to its UI, placing more important options up top, while hiding away buttons for the Locked Folder down below.</p><p>A few months later, in late 2024, Google Photos brought in the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-updates-page-rollout">Updates</a>" page. Replacing the "Sharing" button, "Updates" gives users a full-on glimpse of new shared albums, photos, and group conversation updates. Let's also not forget that Google Photos is reportedly ready and waiting on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/early-google-photos-code-material-3-expressive-changes-spotted">Material 3 Expressive upgrade</a>, which might (hopefully) arrive soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>
