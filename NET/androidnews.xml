                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL continues to be one of my favorite phones; Google did a great job with the design, and the software is the best of any phone around. Google actually delivers AI-assisted features you want to use, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the brightest OLED panel of any device I tested, and one of the best camera packages.</p><p>Thanks to Prime Day, it is also a great value. The Pixel 9 Pro XL usually costs $1,099, but right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">you can get it at just $749</a> — a $350 discount. In fact, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is the same cost as its smaller sibling, the Pixel 9 Pro. As much as I like the smaller phone, I know I'm picking up the Pro XL given the choice. If you're on an older phone and looking to upgrade, this is the best time to do it.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ca714e49-d800-4bf6-977c-837bd6fa97f4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="A $350 discount on the Pixel 9 Pro XL makes it one of the best deals this Prime Day.

Google provides the best AI-backed software suite of any brand today.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need the best battery tech, a PWM-sensitive OLED panel, and fast charging.</p><p>I didn't think I would enjoy using the Pixel 9 Pro XL as much as I did. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">used the device for well over two months</a> when it debuted, and it was terrific; even though it doesn't have the best hardware, Google did a great job optimizing the interface, and the phone handles gaming much better than its predecessors.</p><p>Google somehow managed to deliver the brightest OLED panel of any phone. There are no issues with the 6.8-inch panel, and you get great colors and contrast levels. I like the design too; the new camera bar looks very cool, and it doesn't lead to any wobble when using the phone on a table.</p><p>It's mildly annoying that Google continues to limit the base model to 128GB — most phones get 256GB as standard — so if you need additional storage, you'll need to pay an additional $100. The battery lasts all day, but it doesn't have anywhere close to the same fast charging tech as Chinese rivals.</p><p>That said, the software is one of the biggest reasons to switch to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google did all the right things with its UI, and the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. You also get a great AI suite of utilities, and good customizability. The cameras continue to be great, and while Google doesn't use the best modules, it does wonders around software tuning to deliver standout photos.</p><p>All of this is to say that I really like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I think you should consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">buying it now it's on sale at $749</a>. That's still quite a lot of cash, but you're getting a phone that's designed to last seven years.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The Tensor G5 is supposed to be a big upgrade over previous generations, which means it should finally be able to hold its own against Qualcomm's finest. Add to that a rumored telephoto camera and hopefully more advanced display dimming technology, and the Pixel 10 should be worth waiting for.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Should be the same price as the Pixel 9</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Tensor G5 SoC should be a lot more competitive</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Larger battery with quicker charging (rumored)</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Higher PWM dimming for the display (hopefully)</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Telephoto camera expected</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Will ship with Android 16, with exclusive AI features</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Those hoping for a new design will be disappointed</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor might not play nice with certain screen protectors</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_versus" data-id="6461c1f5-9716-4fd5-a8e1-39af2b14e67c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The king of small phones</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is one of the few good compact flagships that exist, and it's cheaper than the Pixel 10. It offers fabulous performance, very good software with useful AI features, equally long software update commitment as a Pixel, and a timeless design. Some areas where Samsung should have improved upon would be the battery size, charging speeds, and the cameras, which are still many generations old.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Smaller form factor with slim bezels</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset with 12GB RAM</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>New and improved Galaxy AI features</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>One UI update is fresh, fun, and genuinely great</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Refined design with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on front and back</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Relatively small 4,000mAh battery</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Slow 25W wired charging speeds</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Same camera system as Galaxy S22</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div><p>Google really hit its stride with the Pixel 9 series in 2024. While the new design might not be for everyone, we think it looks fantastic, and we're glad the upcoming Pixel 10 will continue with it. Rumored to launch in mid-August, the Google Pixel 10 is expected to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 but with some big changes that we've all been waiting for. It could very well be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best compact flagship</a> of 2025. Speaking of which, this makes the Galaxy S25 its biggest rival.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung's entry-level flagship model is often neglected, as compromises to battery size and charging speeds deter most buyers. It hasn't had a proper camera upgrade in years, which means newer models have easily raced past it. Deciding between the Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 won't be easy, especially since they'll likely cost roughly the same.</p><p>The Pixel 10 isn't official yet at the time of publication, so we have to rely on leaks and rumors for now. Based on our expectations, the Pixel 10 has the potential to surpass the Galaxy S25 as the compact flagship king. Here's how the features of both phones compare.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is expected to look pretty much identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, and that's alright in our books. We just got a massive design overhaul last year, so no one's surprised about this. The expected dimensions of the Pixel 10 (and, by extension, the 10 Pro) are 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm. Other than being 0.1mm thicker, the rest of the dimensions are the same as those of the 9. Based on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out" target="_blank">early cases we've obtained</a>, the Pixel 10 is expected to have a slightly larger camera bar, which means Pixel 9 cases won't fit the 10.</p><p>This would make the Pixel 10 slightly thicker and with a larger footprint than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. We really hope Google makes the 10 lighter, as the Pixel 9 was nearly 200g, which was way heavier than the 162g Galaxy S25. We should also expect some new colors for the 10, along with an IP68 dust and water resistance. We could hope for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a>, which would put it above the S25. Build quality will be top-notch thanks to an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (or better) for the front and back.</p><p>Displays on Pixels have long been a weak link. While the Pixel 9 increased the peak brightness of the panels to 2,700 nits, it still employs a 240Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">PWM dimming</a> frequency, which is problematic if your eyes are sensitive to flicker. We should hopefully see this fixed on the Pixel 10, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> in April 2025 that they "are aware and investigating this."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">Samsung Galaxy S25 won't wow you with its look</a>, much like an iPhone, but it's something that's been refined over the past several generations. It, too, comes in multiple pastel shades, including some exclusive colors, if you buy it directly via Samsung's online store. It boasts similar levels of build quality, featuring an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass on both the front and back. It's IP68 rated for weather resistance, and it's more compact and lighter than the Pixel 10.</p><p>The display on the Galaxy S25 measures 6.2 inches with a Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED panel, and a high brightness of up to 2,600 nits. The display is crisp and easily legible outdoors on a sunny day, and it has a much higher PWM dimming rate of 480Hz compared to the Pixel.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 is not expected to receive any price increase, which means it should continue to cost $799 for 128GB of storage and $899 for 256GB. This would make it slightly pricier than the Galaxy S25. The big change that we're all excited to see is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip, which will be its first smartphone SoC designed completely in-house and manufactured by TSMC.</p><p>All previous Tensor chips were based on Samsung's Exynos chip designs, which weren't really helping in any way. With a new design and fabrication partner, The G5 should hopefully be able to go head-to-head or even beat the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip.</p><p>Besides getting a bump in raw performance, we should hopefully see a larger battery, too, with quicker charging. The second major change rumored is the inclusion of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">telephoto camera on the base Pixel 10</a>. This has usually been reserved for just the Pro models in the past, but with this addition, the Pixel 10 would be more Pro than ever.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 480Hz PWM, HDR10+, 2600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 10MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68/IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 typically sells for a lower price today, even without any major sales, making it a better value. Even the top-end 256GB variant now costs around $779.99 on Samsung's website, which is significantly lower than what the Pixel 10's equivalent is expected to cost.</p><p>One of the best features of the Galaxy S25 is its solid and dependable performance, considering the compact and lightweight design. Gaming performance is very good; it doesn't heat up as much, and the display is easy on the eyes in low light. All the cameras are great, too, but it's nothing spectacular since the sensors have been recycled from older models once again.</p><p>The same applies to the battery life, which is acceptable for the phone's size, but it could have been improved. You should still get a full day's worth of use on one charge but don't expect much more. Charging is still stuck at 25W, which is somewhat disappointing for a phone at this price.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-software-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Pixel 9, which didn't launch with the latest version of Android at the time, the Pixel 10 will most likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> this time since the stable version is already available for the Pixel 9 series.

We feel Google's AI features are more useful, the Pixel 10's design is bolder, and you'll always be ahead of Samsung when it comes to getting the latest Android flavor and features. It's going to be more expensive at launch for sure, but with trade-in offers and other pre-order discounts, you should be able to offset some of the premium.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 is a solid phone, no doubt, and it's a great value buy if you can find it at a discount during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon's Prime Day sale</a>.

This means Samsung will likely offer certain (read: most commonly used) Galaxy AI features as part of a subscription package, which would incur an additional monthly or yearly expense.</p><p>Google doesn't really do this (not yet anyway), which means nearly all AI features on the Pixel 10 would be free to use indefinitely.

The latest buzz claims the Ultra model might be getting an upgrade to its 3x zoom camera.</p><p>New details from Ice Universe on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PzEo0uobY" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-design-upgrade-leak-3574334/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) give us a clearer look at what Samsung is cooking up for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera gear.</p><p>As per the rumor, Samsung is sticking with the tried-and-true for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This means we can expect the same 200MP main camera and 50MP 5x zoom lens, just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s26-ultra/" target="_blank">previous rumors said</a>.</p><p>However, Ice Universe says the 3x telephoto camera is getting a noticeable upgrade to 12MP. For context, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra rocks a 10MP lens for its 3x zoom. If the latest leak checks out, it will be a small but meaningful upgrade, especially for fans of crisp portraits and zoom shots.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely keeping its usual 5,000mAh battery, but charging might finally get the upgrade fans have been waiting for. While Samsung has been stuck at 45W for years, word is the S26 Ultra could crank it up to something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">brings it more in line with the fast-charging heavyweights</a> out there.</p><h2 id="slimmer-but-still-stacked-2">Slimmer but still stacked</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-camera-islands-03" alt="Looking at the raised camera lenses on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One standout potential change is in the body itself. Ice Universe claims the S26 Ultra is slimming down, landing somewhere in the 7.xmm range. That’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-trying-to-make-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-with-new-camera-lenses">noticeably thinner than the S25 Ultra’s 8.2mm frame</a>.</p><p>Packing the same 5,000mAh battery into a much slimmer frame isn’t exactly an easy feat, and if Samsung pulls it off, it’s a pretty big win for design and hardware engineering. Still, for power users chasing all-day juice, a bigger battery would’ve been the real dream.</p><p>In a separate report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-key-specs-upgrades-leak.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra is getting a front camera upgrade. The exact specs are still under wraps for now, but something better definitely seems to be in the pipeline.</p><p>On top of that, the outlet says the 200MP main camera is expected to get a new and likely improved lens, plus a fresh laser autofocus sensor designed to lock focus faster and more reliably.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Hardware that screams, “We’ve paid attention to detail, fit, and finish.” It is in that beauty that the functionality is often hidden, delivering explosive results.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins' latest Px7 S3 over-ear headphones could have been named the “007.”. Everything about them feels premium, like Bond’s Aston Martin Vanquish. They wear like one of his bespoke suits, comfortable over long hours, while looking every bit the part.</p><p>The Px7 also boast versatile functionality, like a watch or pen that Bond’s weapons/gadgets guy, Q, would give you. Most importantly, sonically, they’re as engrossing and smooth as Adele’s delivery of the “Skyfall” theme song.</p><p>As they say, “the Bond despot is in the details,” so let’s break down what makes Bowers & Wilkins' latest generation of the <del>007</del> Px7 series a welcome and worthy addition to your options for best-in-class noise-canceling over-ear headphones.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-price-and-availability"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-in-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 shown with case open and accessories lid closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 was launched in April 2025 outside the US and Latin America.

Most recently, one of my favorite headphone cases was for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/noble-fokus-apollo-review" target="_blank">Noble Focus Apollo</a>, partially because I like how they created the pocket to stow cables. I’m no fan of those mesh pockets in the lids of some products.</p><p>The Px7 S3 improves on that by offering a smaller case with cable storage featuring a magnetic lid that keeps things looking nice and tidy inside. My only complaint is the lack of a lanyard attachment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-accessories.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 in their case, with the accessory storage flap open and included cables showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opening the case and getting to the goods inside, you’re greeted by two USB-C cables. One terminates in a 3.5mm male plug for analog audio, and the other is USB-C for 24/96kHz high-resolution digital audio. For the first time, the Px7 S3 features a built-in headphone amplifier/DAC that powers the connectivity. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins sent me the Indigo Blue pair for this review, and they are gorgeous! From the metal backs of the cans and the hinges to the textured, woven fabrics on the cans and the headband to the vegan leather earcups wrapped around delightfully soft memory foam, the Px7 S3 is very well-appointed.</p><p>Thankfully, Bowers & Wilkins put as much effort into building mechanics and ergonomics. On the head for hours, the clamping force shouldn’t give you headaches. The hinges slide in and out of the headband with reassuring friction and swivel to fit your ears without feeling wobbly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-power-button.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with power and Quick Mode buttons shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Power and Quick Mode buttons. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-playback-controls.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-beauty-shot.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-magnetic-lid-accessories-inside.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-empty-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories shown closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One aspect of the build quality that I love here is the power button. With many competitors, you have to press and hold the power button for a moment, guessing whether it has been activated properly. The Px7 S3’s slide switch never leaves any doubt about whether you’ve switched the headphones on or off or placed them into pairing mode.</p><p>I have the Quick Mode button set to cycle through ANC modes, but you can also set it to invoke your voice assistant. That’s on the left can.</p><p>The right can is where you’ll find the volume buttons, with the play/pause button between them, and they all have excellent tactility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-AP80-DAC-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to the Hidisz AP80 PRO-X DAP via the included USB-C to 3.5mm cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the luminescence of a diverse array of musical genres, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 were beautiful every time. My cup of tea, for sure!</p><p>The Px7 S3 aren't tuned for reference audio, but instead provide a highly engaging and entertaining listening platform, with the DAC/amps powering robust audio, matched to the angled 40mm biocellulose drivers. Those components have been completely redesigned, with all but one element being new to the Px7 S3—a near redesign from its predecessor, the Px7 S2e.</p><p>I listened to audio in Bluetooth mode, utilizing high-resolution aptX with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>. I also tested sound quality via wired connections to the same phone as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-questyle-m18i" target="_blank">excellent Questyle M18i DAC</a> and Hidizs’ AP80 PRO-X DAP (pictured above). Most surprisingly, the sound quality directly from the phone was as good as it was being pumped through the M18i. That speaks volumes about the quality of the DSP and amp/DAC in the Px7 S3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-on-head" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of the files I listened to were either high-resolution Tidal streams or local DSF and FLAC files. One of my favorite DSF tracks for testing nuance in the mids is Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” and Bowers & Wilkins does not disappoint! A few seconds into the song's intro, Jackson’s backing vocals come into the mix, and lesser headphones don’t isolate them well enough to help them stand out from the whole mix as the Px7 S3 does.</p><p>Listening to that track also gave me a glimpse into the weight of the bass representation on offer here. It’s weighty without dropping slop all over the other frequencies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-Google-Pixel9-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to a Google Pixel 9 via the included USB-C to USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dubstep, Hip-Hop, Jazz tracks, and anything with deep bass or driving basslines were thoroughly engaging and immersive. Much like the Hulk but with David Banner’s psyche at the helm of the green monster, the lows have the ability to smash, but under the Px7 S3’s authority, they are a model for power under control.</p><p>Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!?!!” both have deeply resonant sub-bass, which is produced with delicious depth in these cans without muddying the mids and highs in those tracks. Booming 808s and dark sub-bass are both tightly controlled, with no bleed. This is evident as you listen to the bagpipes in the mix on the Roots’ track.</p><p>Overall, the treble is smooth, not analytical, which makes listening to Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” more pleasurable. There are some shrill horns in that mix, which can get a bit fatiguing when I listen via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser’s god-tier IE900 IEMs</a>. This also makes listening to some metal tracks a smoother experience as you get into wailing electric guitar riffs.</p><p>System of a Down’s meticulously mastered albums are a joy to listen to with the Px7 S3. You truly get the texture and grit, the detail in Daron Malakian's fingering frets, with strong vocal representation as lead singer Serj Tankian, goes from softer singing to more guttural speed metal-style vocal delivery.</p><p>With the treble being on the smoother side, you get a more intimate soundstage that isn’t as airy or as deep as others. It’s still there, and it’s solid, and some may prefer it over larger presentations.</p><p>When it comes to nuance, Bowers & Wilkins' in-house developed digital signal processing does a fantastic job of maintaining the sound's robustness at lower listening levels, just as it does when the volume is cranked.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-1" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-settings" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-2" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home, showing ANC options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-EQ" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app five-band EQ customization and True Sound option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>By the way, does anyone call anyone anymore? I'm not sure, but folks definitely do Zoom and other video chats, so it's good to know that the microphones on the Px7 S3s do a great job of ensuring your voice is clear while eliminating a good amount of background noise.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins claims you'll get 30 hours out of these cans with ANC on, and so far, I've been on track to match that. Of course, you can control ANC directly on the headphones, but the app also allows you to do that, and this year, you even get expanded sound customization in the form of a five-band EQ, up from three in the previous generation.</p><p>The app is fairly basic, but that's okay because you can do a lot with the headphones themselves, so you don't actually need much in the app. The default sound is so good that I didn't find additional tuning necessary and was just fine with what Bowers & Wilkins labels "True Sound," which is touted as tuning that allows you to listen to recordings just as the artists intended.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: What could use improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-headphones-propped-up.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 propped up on a deck, showing the branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch"><strong>Sony, Post Malone partner for the WH-1000XM6 headphones that wrap you in music</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio codecs explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ</strong></a></p></div></div><p>ANC does a solid job when it comes to low-frequency sounds, but you will have some high-frequency bleed. Noise from cars, cafe silverware clanking, and even voices in the upper register, but that’s with the sound off. With your music playing, much of that ambient noise won’t be noticeable, thanks to auditory masking.</p><p>Officially, there is currently no support for spatial audio, which, in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE</a>, will be added later this year. However, there is a “spatial audio” toggle in the Bluetooth settings on my Google Pixel 9. Why mention this? There is some barely noticeable latency when watching videos, and deactivating this toggle helps alleviate the issue.</p><p>I also noticed that some films lose a bit of mid-frequency impact when it’s activated, which is apparent in “Thor: Ragnarok” because Thor’s hammer loses some of its punch. Deactivating HD Audio also helps with latency, which I don’t think most viewers would notice anyway. I have decades of experience in film and TV editing, so I’m prone to noticing <em>extremely</em> subtle sync issues between picture and sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-earcups.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 showing the insides of the earcups" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the headphones don’t launch with Bluetooth LE, that also includes support for Auracast.

Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that drives the rest of the S25 lineup, plus you get a massive 200MP camera and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. And like many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, the Edge comes with seven years of guaranteed software support straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, all of that shed weight has to come from somewhere, and it's true that the Galaxy S25 Edge only has a meager 3,900mAh battery. This means that the device won't last as long as some 2025 phones, so you'll have to decide if the thin frame is worth the hit. That said, for folks who love sleek and sophisticated devices, like yours truly, buying the Galaxy S25 Edge is a no-brainer. Sure, Prime Day 2025 (July 8-11) is sure to come with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Galaxy deals</a> in tow, but if you're looking for a change in your wireless setup, why not see if T-Mobile can hook you up with something free and fancy today? </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung reportedly saw a major 18% YoY decline, which topped Apple's 9% drop in shipments.</p><p>While Samsung and Apple are on opposite sides of this totem pole, Counterpoint highlights Chinese makers like Huawei and Xiaomi, which saw happier first quarters. Research states both Chinese OEMs saw a 53% jump in Q1 shipments YoY. Moreover, China, as a whole, saw a 37% boost in watch shipments, followed by LATAM with 24%.</p><p>The smartwatch market is speculated to improve later in 2025, per Counterpoint's senior research analyst, Anshika Jain. This could occur at a "modest pace," with a projected growth of roughly 3%. Jain adds that what may bring people back are the innovations and improvements in smartwatches, most notably thanks to "AI features and next-generation health sensors."</p><h2 id="samsung-looks-to-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">Samsung looks to the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung might have to look toward its Galaxy Watch 8 models to breathe some sort of life into its wearable performance.

Depending on the websites you need to visit and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans" target="_blank">quality of your service connection</a>, you may experience problems from time to time. Factors such as how the website is served to you or the quality of your wireless service in a particular location are largely beyond your control, so let's start with what you <em>can</em> control.</p><p>In the settings of your phone, there are several things you should review. Unfortunately, every phone is slightly different, and even different carriers can have different settings; however, what we're looking for is relatively simple to find.</p><p>There is a setting that allows you to use your data connection when you're not on Wi-Fi. If pages load sometimes, this is probably enabled, but you should check. On my unlocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, there's a slider that's labeled <strong>Use Mobile Data</strong>,<strong> </strong>so yours should say something similar. Make sure it's turned on.</p><p>Phones and carriers often have a way to limit bandwidth. This can be handy while you're roaming or if you're on a limited data plan, but it can also choke a connection if the website is a little heavy on resources. You're looking for a setting to <strong>allow 5G data</strong> and one to <strong>allow data use while roaming</strong>. For now, make sure both of these are on. <em>Remember where you found them in case you want to turn them off again in the future.</em></p><h2 id="have-you-hit-the-data-cap-2">Have you hit the data cap?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="itBoncmWXRJCvnC3oZUbrN" name="mint data usage.jpg" alt="mint mobile app showing data usage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itBoncmWXRJCvnC3oZUbrN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every wireless plan has a cap when the data connection is either cut off or slowed to a crawl. You may be paying for an "unlimited" data plan, but trust me, your carrier will slow you down if it thinks it needs to, based on how much you're using and where you are.</p><p>Most of the time, they use words like high-speed data to differentiate. Let's say you pay for 10GB of data each month. You should expect to be able to use your service as fast as it can be for those 10GB. Once you've used it up, most carriers will still let things work, just at a very slow rate.</p><p>This slow data rate is enough to allow an iPhone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> to still work normally; both need to connect to Apple or Google every once in a while but use very little bandwidth for these check-ins.

As typical data speeds increase, this problem worsens — web designers build a page so it looks great under ideal circumstances, but often overlook what happens when things aren't ideal.</p><p>You can check to see how much data you've used in the mobile data settings of your phone, or you can just call your carrier and ask. You may even have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-verizon-demo-app-vulnerability-details" target="_blank">app from your carrier</a> that displays this number. If you've used your monthly allotment of high-speed data or use a lot of data in general, you might be getting throttled.</p><p>You will need to contact your carrier about this. If they are limiting the bandwidth available to you, there's nothing you can do to change it. They'll probably try to upsell you a higher-tier plan, so be prepared for a sales pitch.</p><h2 id="location-matters-more-than-you-think-2">Location matters more than you think</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.17%;"><img id="G4QgBkpsAoXBsPv7vkWu2Q" name="verizon coverage map september 2024.jpg" alt="verizon coverage map as of september 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4QgBkpsAoXBsPv7vkWu2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1223" height="687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you zoom in close on any carrier's coverage map, you'll soon see that they are full of holes.

There's nothing wrong with the phone; it's just a weak connection, lots of forest, and big stone mountains affecting the signal.</p><p>There is nothing I can do to fix this. There isn't a lot the carriers can do to fix it. either. It would be impossible to filter out every dead zone by placing a tower or repeater to blanket the area in coverage, and if it were possible, someone would have to pay for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you notice problems in a particular location, it's possible that you're experiencing the same issue.

Sometimes, you can get lucky, but chances are, if one carrier doesn't offer robust service in a location, neither will any of the others.</p><p>If I were to put on a blindfold and just guess at what the problem might be, I would say you're either being throttled by your carrier or live where the connection isn't the greatest. But be sure to check your settings and be mindful of where things work well and where they don't. It could make all the difference.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Although it may not be as durable as the dive-certified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, you'll likely adapt to the 970's weight more easily.</p><p>Speaking of the display, the doubled brightness is a serious highlight, answering my Fenix 8 complaint that its AMOLED display is too dull and foggy in sunlight. The Forerunner 970 and 570 are more vibrant, making outdoor use a pleasure instead of a chore.</p><p>The downside is that these brighter displays drain the battery more quickly, so the Forerunner 970 hits 15 days or less, trailing the 965's 23-day max.

Garmin Pay and downloadable music app playlists from Spotify, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music might seem pedestrian, but its rivals don't offer them.</p><p>It's also nice to finally have a mic and speaker in a Forerunner to make a quick call or voice reply on my wrist mid-run. The mic quality is quiet but clear, catching your voice with a normal walking motion but sounding best held up to your mouth; the speaker at max volume also picks up the other caller coherently in windy outdoor conditions.</p><p>The processor is optimized to handle all on-watch tasks fairly quickly, though slower than a smartwatch with proper RAM. But it notably struggles with offline maps. Zoom in or out, pan to a new area, search for nearby landmarks or generate a round-trip route on the watch, and it's a painfully slow wait. I rely on the Connect mobile app to create and upload routes instead.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on a table outside, the display showing the text "Try Saying 'What can I say?'" for the Voice Assistant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Fenix 8, the Forerunner 970 supports passthrough phone commands (Siri or Google Assistant/Gemini) and an on-watch Voice Assistant with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-025D75CF-3445-49E1-8D81-1AA74AB4E00F/EN-US/GUID-4BF33D87-605B-4013-8CBE-DF6E78F786DD.html">"natural speech"</a> commands to open an app, menu, or activity.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's liable to errors and leaps of logic: "Show VO2 Max" opened the Intensity Minutes widget, "Training Load Focus" could only show the general Training Status menu, and "Run Settings" started a Run or opened general settings.

The fact that this watch is barely heavier than past models, lasts two weeks with enhanced brightness, and <em>only</em> seems to struggle with maps is a sign of how well-optimized it is.</p><p>After a month, the Forerunner 970 battery life has matched my expectations when set to the default 2/3 brightness. It'll last 15 days with normal settings but fall closer to 10 days if you do regular GPS-tracked runs and walks, enable nightly SpO2 readings, or use maps or on-wrist calling frequently.</p><p>An hour of SatIQ-mode GPS uses up about 4–5% of the battery, but that's fairly standard for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. The display is the real battery killer, especially if you enable always-on display mode. Garmin says it'll last eight days with AOD, but I'd say half that is more accurate.</p><p>My advice is to stick with tilt-to-wake. You can adjust the brightness settings to the old 1,000-nit standard if you miss the 965's three-week battery, but I've accepted more regular charging for the visibility boost.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-gps-hr-accuracy"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: GPS & HR accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-run-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the main Running widget, with time, distance, pace, and heart rate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Multiple accuracy tests proved that the Forerunner 970 is highly accurate for GPS and HR data.</strong></li><li><strong>The Forerunner 970 has Garmin's full health suite, including blood oxygen, breathing rate, HRV, ECGs, and skin temp.</strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Features</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-fitness-test-gps-heart-rate-steps-running-tolerance"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 970 fitness test</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 570 review</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review"><strong>Garmin Fenix 8 review</strong></a><strong></strong></p></div></div><p>I previously performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-fitness-test-gps-heart-rate-steps-running-tolerance">Forerunner 970 fitness test</a>, breaking down its HR, GPS, and step count accuracy across multiple tests. The crux is that the Forerunner 970 is as accurate as a $750 watch should be.</p><p>For heart rate, the Elevate v5 sensor is Garmin's most accurate option, and it shows. It does very well for normal runs, only inflating my HR by about 1 bpm at times. For anaerobic track workouts, it remains within 1–2 bpm of my Polar H10 chest strap, rapidly recognizing changes in effort; many competing brands will be 5–10 bpm off for the same activity type.</p><p>GPS tracking is fantastic, particularly the dual-band GPS mode, which allows you to trace your path exactly on a satellite map. The SatIQ mode also works well and saves a few hours of battery, but can struggle more with obstacles like underpasses.</p><p>Its step counting was absurdly accurate, measuring 5,000 and 5,001 steps after I manually counted 5,000 steps twice.

Highlights, as always, are Body Battery, Training Status/Readiness, HRV Status, and nightly Pulse Ox data. You get a holistic look at the source of your tiredness, from workouts and poor sleep to breathing issues.</p><p>While Garmin watches don't offer "sleep apnea detection" like Galaxy Watches, they have the battery life for all-night pulse ox readings. Frequent breathing variations or a low minimum SpO2 score will warn you to see your doctor.</p><p>Specific to the Forerunner 970, you can take active ECGs to detect AFib issues — though there's no passive irregular heart rhythm tracking, as Fitbit, Apple, and Samsung offer.

They're what make Forerunners so vital for runners like me, but I won't bloat this review with non-exclusive features. These are the Forerunner 970 software highlights:</p><p><strong></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature"><strong>Running tolerance</strong></a> is my absolute favorite Forerunner 970 tool. It judges the biomechanical "impact load" of each mile, recognizing that a hilly trail or hard track run puts more strain on your body's joints and muscles than normal. Then, it judges your body's weekly impact load limit, or tolerance, to prevent overtraining. I already rely on this data when planning workouts.</p><p>I couldn't test the 970's other new metrics, <strong>running economy</strong> and <strong>step speed</strong>, because I don't have the HRM-600 chest strap required to measure my running form efficiency and wasted energy. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">intentionally changing your running form doesn't work</a>, these metrics only provide context, not anything actionable for training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Schedule a race in your Garmin Calendar, and the <strong>projected race time predictor</strong> shows how fast Garmin's algorithm thinks you could run it in X weeks if you stick to its training plan. I found its prediction for my next half marathon wildly optimistic, but maybe I'm just not pushing hard enough.</p><p>If I pre-download my race course, the <strong>Auto Lap by Timing Gates</strong> tool will only trigger a "mile" or "kilometer" lap when I pass the physical mile marker. It's easy to run more than a mile without the perfect line; this eliminates the gap and shows your "real" race pace instead of your GPS-based one.</p><p>Also, if you forget to stop an activity at the finish line, <strong>Suggested Finish line</strong> lets you go back and edit it to the correct stopping point, cutting out your post-run cooldown.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E3vpMgjj8nxBj6mr5wRxtJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-evening-report" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 worn on a wrist in low light, showing "My Day" data like the author's run, recovery time, Training Status, and Weather Forecast." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E3vpMgjj8nxBj6mr5wRxtJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I find the new <strong>Evening Report</strong> more useful and motivational than the Morning Report.

That alone isn't worth $750, but combined with the other upgrades, it may be enough for some runners.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-competition"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3964px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5RJPbLwAJfYTDdnXWH9KEH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-review-10" alt="Training status on the Garmin Forerunner 570" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5RJPbLwAJfYTDdnXWH9KEH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3964" height="2230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin's "product compare" data tool lets you directly check every key difference in hardware and features between watches.

A person close to the matter informed the publication that "getting all of TikTok’s users in the U.S. to move over to a new app, bringing their profiles with them, could pose technical issues in practice." There are roughly over 170 million users on TikTok in the U.S., just for perspective.</p><p>While this may seem strange, sources suggest this could be a maneuver to help satiate the U.S. government's "data security" concerns. If you remember, this was a major catalyst behind the government's stern look at TikTok's (ByteDance) handling of data in China.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Trump Administration reportedly informed the press late last week (July 4) that the government is "getting close" to sealing the deal on a TikTok purchase for its U.S. operations. However, a challenge remains: getting China to O.K. the deal.</p><p>ByteDance is supposedly working to get this new "TikTok for U.S." app out on September 5, before its next ban deadline, which is September 17. The report states the new version will be available on U.S. app stores, and there's speculation that TikTok would begin informing its U.S.-based users about the switch ahead of time to prepare. The publication adds that the old (original) version will remain active until March 2026.</p><h2 id="finding-a-way-2">Finding a way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.00%;"><img id="XhbqpFWGc7kXhLoux7Ew6B" name="tiktok-logo.png" alt="TikTok logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhbqpFWGc7kXhLoux7Ew6B.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1250" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TikTok)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been on this TikTok ban train for a while, and last year was no different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-ban-just-got-the-houses-nod-and-it-might-be-law-real-soon">as the House passed a bill</a> that offered two routes: sell to a U.S. company or face a ban. While TikTok's part was included in the country's larger bill focusing on foreign sanctions, the root of the problem is the nation's worry about how the app is using user data. In 2024, legislators expressed concern over the app's ties to China and that the app could "push propaganda to the US crowd."</p><p>Moreover, the "heaps" of data TikTok is cataloguing were also a concern.</p><p>ByteDance has remained against the idea of completely selling off TikTok in the U.S., stating it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">rather ditch the country entirely</a>. Fast-forward to today, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/trump-tiktok-ban-1236435564/">Trump has extended TikTok's stay</a> in the U.S. until September 17, as the country seeks divestiture.

It seemed evident earlier this year that ByteDance was working with the government to hash out a way forward that both sides could be happy with.</p><p>Still, nothing was set in stone, and there were "key matters" that needed to be resolved. Perhaps this alleged TikTok U.S. version could solve those problems. If the reports are true, we might only have a couple of months to wait and see.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This device is meant to be a tri-fold phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>; however, TECNO says its version will be the "thinnest of its kind." A major highlight of the Ultimate G Fold is TECNO's decision to go with an inward-folding design.</p><p>The post says its inner displays fold inward "twice," to "shield the screens when not in use." TECNO remains confident that this inward-folding method will keep your displays protected from "scratches and impacts."</p><p>Internally, the Ultimate G Fold concept features a dual-hinge, as expected. TECNO states users can unfold the phone and lay it completely flat. Moreover, despite rocking the internal mechanisms designed for a phone with three screens, the post adds that the Ultimate G Fold is as thin as a dual-screen (book-style) phone. We'll have to see just how thin TECNO can go, and if it comes anywhere near <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor's Magic V5</a>.</p><p>TECNO teases the G Fold's "smooth, multi-angle hovering" capabilities for hands-free uses, which mirrors a laptop and gives users another way to enjoy content. The company plans to fully unveil its Ultimate G Fold concept in mid-July, but we might've gotten an early (alleged) look.</p><h2 id="still-just-a-concept-2">Still just a concept</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:803px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.72%;"><img id="8g8PWFDaLgYCfp2i2mZTkA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak" alt="A rumored real life photo of a person holding TECNO's Ultimate G Fold in its folded state." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8g8PWFDaLgYCfp2i2mZTkA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="803" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:803px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.72%;"><img id="PAuA8VmYpqx5xcNnmXBsjA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak-unfolding" alt="An alleged real life photo of a person unfolding TECNO's Ultimate G Fold concept foldable phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAuA8VmYpqx5xcNnmXBsjA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="803" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:447px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.23%;"><img id="jXQcHh4wwLWpjEj3Kq3WfA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak-standing" alt="An alleged real life photo of the TECNO Ultimate G Fold concept foldable opened and standing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXQcHh4wwLWpjEj3Kq3WfA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="447" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Early this morning (July 7), prominent tipster Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1942186104561750466">posted a few snapshots</a> of the alleged Ultimate G Fold concept from TECNO on X.

This is a notable difference from the company's other concept shown off in 2024.</p><p>Speaking of 2024, TECNO gave us a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">solid look at its tri-fold concept</a>, which was previously called the Phantom Ultimate 2. A clear difference between what's been alleged on social media and the 2024 concept art is its camera array. TECNO started with a vertical triple array, but has seemingly switched to a horizontal look. It's also worth mentioning that TECNO states its tri-fold can achieve an 11mm measurement when folded.</p><p>At the time, that was slightly slimmer than Samsung's Z Fold 6 (12.1mm). We'll have to see how far TECNO has come with its folded and unfolded measurements.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

AI and machine learning were around well before then, but ChatGPT's emergence marked a turning point. Soon after, AI would become everywhere — on our phones, in our favorite apps, and part of our most-used services.</p><p>Whenever something new pops up, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, it takes a while for researchers to learn its true effects on our minds and daily lives. That process is only beginning, but an early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1" target="_blank">study</a> from MIT's Media Lab highlights some concerning trends regarding AI usage. It hasn't been peer-reviewed yet and has a small scope, including 54 participants aged 18 to 39 years old from the Boston region.</p><p>The results found that people regularly using ChatGPT to write essays had the lowest brain engagement of the groups studied and "consistently underperformed" at all levels compared to the other groups, which used either Google Search or only their own brains to write essays. The study demonstrates "the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills" resulting from LLM use, per the report.</p><p>If you use AI tools, that probably sounds scary. You might be wondering whether using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">generative AI and large language models (LLMs)</a> regularly puts your critical thinking skills at risk. While there's reason for concern, using AI for the right things probably won't be as dangerous to your mind as you might think.</p><h2 id="what-the-mit-study-found-2">What the MIT study found</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it's important to understand the scope of the study and what its results actually mean. The team of researchers at MIT wanted to figure out how using AI to write an essay affected participants' learning and brain function. The study contained three groups: a brain-only group, an LLM group, and a search engine group.</p><p>The participants were asked to write three essays, one per session while remaining in their group. Those who were in the brain-only group could not use any external tools to write their essays in any of the sessions, for example. Then, in the fourth and final session, LLM users were asked to use only their brains to write an essay, and brain-only users were permitted to use LLMs — 18 participants took part in this final test.</p><p>All the while, researchers measured brain activity across 32 regions using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a device that records electrical signals firing in the brain. The tests aimed to record not only how cognitive function behaved during essay writing while using brain-only, LLMs, or search engines but also how it changed following prolonged LLM usage.</p><p>Aside from measuring brain activity with EEGs, the researchers conducted interviews with participants after each session. They also used human teachers to score essays while having an "AI judge" evaluate the works.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P" name="chatgpt-kotor-ii-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="ChatGPT Live Conversation transcript about KOTOR II on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The results painted a clear picture: brain activity and engagement decreased with the amount of external tools needed. The study found that the brain-only group had the strongest level of brain connectivity, with the search engine group displaying intermediate levels and the LLM group performing the weakest.</p><p>When the LLM users were asked to use only their brains to write the final essay, the participants "showed weaker neural connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks." In contrast, brain-only groups who were then permitted to use an LLM for the final essay "demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and prefrontal nodes."</p><p>In layman's terms, those who used an LLM to write the essays produced lower-quality work, couldn't recall what they had submitted, and had lower brain engagement. Additionally, those who had relied on LLMs before being asked to only use their brains performed worse than the brain-only group.</p><p>"The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group's participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring," the study found.</p><h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-you-an-ai-user-2">What does this mean for you, an AI user?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPJdJmhzrozDPLkfEdtkBA" name="how-to-use-chatgpt-on-chromebook-16x9.jpg" alt="Bing ChatGPT on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPJdJmhzrozDPLkfEdtkBA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The study's results are yet to be peer-reviewed, but let's face it, they aren't exactly surprising. Like any other muscle, your brain needs to be used regularly to stay in shape. If you stop using your brain to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-custom-ai-gems-workspace-apps-side-panel-rollout">write essays, reports, emails, or text messages often</a>, those skills will start to deteriorate.</p><p>People who often vouch for AI in learning and work environments often compare chatbots and LLMs to a calculator. When the calculator first became prolific, teachers wanted it banned. Now, calculators are allowed to be used in educational settings and are a vital part of our everyday lives — they're on our phones, computers, and even smartwatches.</p><p>I do think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-of-googles-best-generative-ai-features-is-rolling-out-on-older-pixel-phones-for-free">generative AI</a> is like a calculator, but maybe not in the way its advocates think. As a writer, I haven't used complex math regularly since my early college days, when I was getting my required math courses out of the way. Since then, a calculator has been my best friend, and guess what? I'm not as good at mental math as I was before.</p><p>Similarly, I haven't regularly handwritten words in years — I'm an all-digital person now and have been for some time. When I get handed a form at the doctor's office, my penmanship isn't nearly as good as it once was, and I get hand cramps pretty quickly. All that is to say, the MIT study's findings are really just reinforcing common sense. If you create a dependency on artificial intelligence and stop using a particular skill, you will absolutely lose it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM" name="pixel-studio-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, that's not as scary as it might sound. It all depends on <em>how</em> you incorporate AI into your daily life. Want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">generative AI to make a wallpaper</a> or a cool image to share with your friends? Want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini to replace Google Assistant</a> as your voice-based helper on an Android phone? Need it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">analyze long documents</a>? I don't think any of these use cases present a significant risk of harming your cognitive abilities.</p><p>When you use AI to do something you <em>can</em> do yourself, you're at risk of losing those skills. If you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> to write all your emails, documents, and reports, there is a good chance your skills will start to fade away — that's essentially what the MIT study found.</p><p>But that's not how I use artificial intelligence, and I don't think that's how most people use it, either. I use AI to do things I couldn't possibly do, and that's why it's helpful. That includes analyzing and summarizing documents that are thousands of pages long or generating an image that I couldn't create because I'm no artist. In those instances, AI is expanding your capabilities, not replacing them.</p><p>If you look at AI as a way to elevate your possibilities rather than replace the things you'd rather not do, you probably don't need to change your AI usage habits. However, if you want to use AI to eliminate certain parts of your workflow, think about whether you're willing to lose those skills in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When UGREEN said that it was also making a USB-C cable with a built-in display, I was excited.</p><p>The Uno 100W USB-C to USB-C cable ticks all the right boxes; it has a nylon-braided design that makes it durable, aluminum shells on either end, and an E-marker chip — a must-have in all cables that go up to 100W.

The display defaults to an emoji, and it's similar to what you get with the rest of the Uno line, with UGREEN doing a great job building out a playful theme. While you don't get useful details like how fast a connected device is charging, the included animations are adorable, and if anything, they add to the Uno's distinctiveness.</p><p>Now, UGREEN could have easily slotted in a power meter into the cable, and it would have been similar to dozens of other options you can get today. But it didn't do that, and I like the frivolity of bundling an LED panel just to showcase emoji. The cable itself is pretty great, and it doesn't cost much more than an equivalent rival — the 1.6ft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0D7BL2JBN">option is $9</a>, there's a 6.6ft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0D7B719XQ?th=1">cable that's $13</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0DLBFXVBG">10ft model is $16</a>.</p><p>The Uno cable holds up just as well with data, going up to 480Mbps. I didn't have any issues using it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Vivo X200 Pro, OnePlus 13, and the Honor Magic 7 Pro, but I will admit that I routinely got distracted by the emoji — it is quite adorable.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

With this iteration of the Nexode power bank, I don't need to do that — having a built-in cable is just easier. And when I need additional cables, UGREEN now makes a 100W retractable USB-C cable as well, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Retractable-Charger-MacBook-AirPods/dp/B0DXDT9SKW">costs just $11</a>.</p><p>You're missing out if you're not using retractable cables; they're just as great to use as standard USB-C cables, and you don't deal to deal with any clutter. The best part is that UGREEN isn't charging anything extra for the retractable version of the Nexode 20,000mAh Power Bank. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0DSPXHFBM">retailing at just $69</a>, you are getting a standout value as well.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it’s not stopping at the chat screen, as this fresh new look could be starting to spread its wings across more parts of the app.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-profile-pages-material-3-expressive-apk-teardown-3573978/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug up something interesting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> v20250701 beta, suggesting that Material 3 Expressive buttons are heading to the profile page. You’ll spot the update when you tap a contact’s name at the top of a chat or hit their profile picture in the conversation list and tap the “i” icon.</p><p>The potential redesign zeroes in on the four main buttons under a contact’s number—Call, Video, Contact info, and Search. Instead of the usual round icons, they’re getting stretched into pill-shaped buttons.</p><h2 id="buttons-with-personality-2">Buttons with personality</h2><p>Additionally, they react when you tap them, gently expanding in width, then snapping back once you let go. It’s a small touch, but it adds a nice bit of flair and polish.</p><p>The new buttons are noticeably bigger, and they're totally in step with the Material 3 Expressive look that has been popping up across other Google apps lately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="WR5mUt62PcGGTiXyfyPptj" name="Google-Messages-Profile-page-M3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive buttons on the profile page in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WR5mUt62PcGGTiXyfyPptj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this feature only showed up after some manual tinkering by the folks at Android Authority. So, sideloading the Google Messages beta APK alone won’t flip the switch on its own.</p><p>Last month, Google was spotted working on changing the tabs for emoji, Photomoji, GIFs, and sticker panel in Messages. Instead of sitting side-by-side like before, they’re grouped in a neat, pill-shaped layout that makes each option stand out more. Tap one, and it pops with a richer color that matches your Material 3 theme.</p><p>Even the “plus” icon got some love, meaning the menu it opens now has slightly bigger, rounder buttons with a bit more breathing room.</p><p>There's no word yet on when this revamped contact page will hit the stable version since it’s still tucked away in the beta at the moment. But with Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">going all-in on Material 3 Expressive at present</a>, it's a safe bet that this update will make its way to everyone soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I like that Aiffro included a magnetic ring in the package, so if you don't have a phone with a magnetic case, you can use the included accessory to attach it securely.</p><p>The magnetic SSD uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 standard and has the entire 20Gbps bandwidth available, and I didn't have any issues moving photos and videos from my phones to the P10 Plus. It goes up to 2,000MB/s, but given that most machines don't have the Gen 2x2 protocol, you'll see 1,000MB/s in actual use — which is more than adequate.</p><p>The only issue I have with the P10 Plus is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable is a little too short, so it is a bit of a hassle to plug it into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> — I had to use another cable to connect it. This isn't an issue with the Lightning to USB-C cable provided in the box, and I don't really get why the brand couldn't have bundled a USB-C to USB-C cable of the same length.</p><p>Anyway, outside of that quibble, I didn't see any problems using the P10 Plus with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. It has a thickness of just 6.5mm and a weight of 41g, and you get a cloth carrying bag that makes it easy to take it anywhere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ASjY78Va4cC3aVN9oyYqf7" name="Aiffro P10 Plus and P30" alt="Aiffro P10 Plus and P30" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ASjY78Va4cC3aVN9oyYqf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Switching over to the P30, it is positioned as a 3-in-1 SSD, and it is pretty unique. It has a standard USB-C connector that lets you plug the drive into a phone, tablet, or Windows/macOS machine, and there are two additional USB-C ports: one acts as USB PD in, giving you the ability to charge your phone while the SSD is connected. The other USB-C port lets you slot in a mic and record to the SSD, a nifty addition.</p><p>The P30 goes up to 1,000MB/s reads and writes like most external SSDs, and coming in at 19g, it is one of the thinnest and lightest drives I used — I have regular flash drivers that are bigger. It is a pretty good solution if you're looking to shoot ProRes or Dolby Vision footage and need an external drive, and the metal chassis is built to last.</p><p>The P30 is available in 1TB and 2TB sizes, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aiffro-Portable-Supports-Microphone-Interface/dp/B0F487HY7L/">starts at $135 right now</a>. The P10 Plus is what I used a majority of the time, and that model can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aiffro-Magnetic-Portable-Lightning-Compatible/dp/B0F486G83B/">bought for $85</a> as of writing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Libra Colour has it all, and with IPX8 water resistance, you can use it in the tub.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a monochrome e-reader on a budget, and you need the Kindle Store.</p><p>The Libra Colour has a plastic chassis, but it doesn't feel like a budget e-reader in the least — Kobo did a good job with the overall design. The white version I'm using looks elegant, and it is also available in a black model. It feels good to hold and use, and isn't uncomfortable even during marathon reading sessions.</p><p>It has the two features I need the most in an e-reader: physical page turn buttons and adjustable warm light. The buttons were a little stiff when I got started with the Libra Colour, but they have good tactility now. You extensive configurability when it comes to adjusting the intensity of the LEDs, and just like the Kindle Oasis, you get a warm light that reduces eye strain.</p><p>A neat addition is the 7-inch color E Ink panel; it unlocks entirely new use cases, and it holds up while reading comics on the device. You can also use the Libra Colour as a journal, and it has stylus integration (there isn't one included in the package). The E Ink panel has 300ppi pixel density, and it is just as good as the one on the Kindle Oasis — with the added versatility of a color panel.</p><p>It has IPX8 ingress protection, so you can use the e-reader in the tub or near the pool. Another welcome addition is USB-C charging; it lasts two weeks between charges even if you read daily, and USB-C just makes it less of a hassle when you need to charge it. Kobo's ebook store isn't anywhere as extensive as Amazon's offering, but on the plus side, the Libra Colour isn't locked down in the same way, so you can easily bring your Kindle ebooks over to the device without any issues.</p><p>Overall, I didn't think I would like the Libra Colour as much as I did, and it is the Kindle Oasis upgrade I've always wanted.

It took me a month to judge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-fitness-test-gps-heart-rate-steps-running-tolerance">Forerunner 970</a> experience in the context of past models. But the Venu X1 is such a bizarre unicorn of a smartwatch that there's no need for careful consideration or in-depth analysis. Let's talk about the most polarizing, oddball watch that Garmin has ever made!</p><p>I've seen the Reddit threads responding to early Venu X1 buyers, calling it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1lg6zzl/day_one_with_venu_x1/">"ugly AF"</a> or like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1la4xnd/799_venu_x1_looks_like_a_cheap_amazfit_watch/">"bad Apple Watch Ultra."</a> I think the reaction would be less <em>visceral</em> if the Venu X1 didn't cost $799, with no Venu 4 in sight. But it's still evoking the Apple design language, for a community that's spurned Apple Watches for years.</p><p>As a Garmin megafan, I can't help but laugh at the indignation, if only because Garmin watches...aren't good-looking, y'all. You're <em>accustomed</em> to the rugged design, but they're still bulky, thick, and lack the luxury style of a "normal" watch. The Venu X1 is merely a more artificial tang of the same bitter medicine we all take to get great fitness insights.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XdpJr2PQxZSwAaQyzBVYcB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Fenix-8-thickness" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Fenix 8 (right) sitting aside each other on a table, showing the difference in design and thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdpJr2PQxZSwAaQyzBVYcB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What more justifiably rubs Garmin hard-liners the wrong way is that this uber-skinny smartwatch has an eight-day battery life that falls to two days with always-on display (AOD), or just 14 all-systems GNSS hours, so you burn at least 7% battery per hour of tracking. Garmin watches usually last longer the more you pay; the Venu X1 inverts that expectation.</p><p>And outside the fitness sphere, the Apple fans Garmin is targeting will love the look but be bewildered by everything else.</p><h2 id="i-ve-never-worn-a-smartwatch-like-the-garmin-venu-x1-no-one-has-2">I've never worn a smartwatch like the Garmin Venu X1; no one has</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-side-view-buttons" alt="A side angle of the Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the photo angled to show the two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu X1's positives are primed to fall on deaf ears because of how it shakes up Garmin's status quo. And it's a shame, because <em>my goodness,</em> the X1 is comfortable to wear.</p><p>It takes up more wrist space than I'm used to, but once that's normalized, I <em>barely</em> notice it. Going from my 71g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> or 75g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8 47mm</a>, my 39g Venu X1 is heavenly, while showing me more data than I'm used to seeing. Most Garmin watches weigh about 50–55g, but without all that screen space.</p><p>And from the side, it's just so dang skinny! People might initially think the Venu X1 looks "unnatural" in top-down photos, but from the side in person, it looks proportional and unassuming on my wrist, where a normal smartwatch protrudes awkwardly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rbiqa8XRqgR2hghNKXAMaB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness-2" alt="A side view of the Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right) held in one hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbiqa8XRqgR2hghNKXAMaB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness-3" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Garmin Venu X1 (right), both worn on one wrist, showing the two watches' comparative thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>People who buy fitness bands like the 31g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> can get double the screen real estate of a fitness band for about a quarter-ounce of extra weight. They'll appreciate that the Venu X1 puts much less pressure on your wrist for sleep tracking than most smartwatches, too.</p><p>My fiancee, a regular Apple Watch wearer, loves the look and how thin it is, and doesn't mind that it's proportionally a bit large for her wrist in exchange for the size and brightness. And she <em>scoffed</em> at the idea that a week of battery life wasn't enough.</p><p>That's why the premise of a large, skinny watch wouldn't be so outlandish...if the Venu X1 didn't suffer from Garmin's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">post-tariff price inflation</a> and target Garmin's traditionalist power users with an $800 price tag.</p><p>The most obvious use case for a 2-inch, 448 x 486 display is maps, and Garmin's strict feature tier list means it won't put offline maps on a cheaper watch. It's frustrating, but consistent with Garmin's strategy. So rather than follow up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, Garmin made this new Ultra alternative with a full suite of tools that only hardcore users need.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Look how much more data fits naturally on the Venu X1 that's squeezed awkwardly onto the Forerunner 970 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't wait to take the Venu X1 out on hikes and follow trails, or to plan out my golf shots on my local courses. And if you subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/893561/">Outdoor Maps+</a>, you can't get a better view unless you buy a GPS handheld.</p><p>Turn-by-turn navigation works on a circular watch because the focus is solely on the arrow, but this 2-inch squircle cuts off the limiters and lets you see more context around you, without needing to zoom out. The same goes for showing more buttons around the map edge without blocking content or making menus larger and more readable.</p><p>Like my Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8, the Venu X1 can be laggy when using maps, a consequence of Garmin's battery efficiency. Anyone used to an Apple Watch will probably care less about the extra topographic detail and wish it were as speedy as Apple Maps.</p><h2 id="the-garmin-venu-x1-is-caught-between-two-audiences-2">The Garmin Venu X1 is caught between two audiences</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-compass" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 worn on a wrist showing the ABC app with a compass, altimeter, and barometer data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's the main problem with the Garmin Venu X1: It can only be this skinny by lacking the CPU and RAM of traditional smartwatches or the long battery life of fitness watches.</p><p>Garmin's target audience (Apple converts) will miss their apps, messaging, and Siri. And the UI is liable to overwhelm them with information and premium fitness features that may not be relevant to their lives. The affordable, limited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> is a better gateway for first-timers.</p><p>As for Garmin power users, the Venu X1 has nearly all the premium features of the Forerunner 970 in a more comfortable package. But these people are <em>accustomed</em> to perks like multi-week battery life and Up/Down buttons during training.</p><p>Other fitness watch fans would happily trade battery life for comfort...but they're not the ones who would spend $800. They'd rather spend $200 on a Fitbit.</p><p>That's why I think the Venu X1 will end up a niche device, too advanced and expensive for fitness casuals but too hamstrung by its skinny design for hardcore fans. But for those who hit that niche sweet spot, they'll absolutely love it: The Venu X1 is cozier and lighter than any other watch this size, the display is fantastic for displaying a ton of data, and it has nearly every feature the Fenix 8 does for $200–300 less.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re expecting the same this time around, as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, and Galaxy Watch 8 are all likely to be unveiled.</p><p>All of this will lead up to the big event, as Samsung Unpacked is set to kick off on Wednesday, July 9 at 10 AM ET, taking place in Brooklyn, New York. And while there will be folks in attendance for the event, Samsung is also live streaming Unpacked as it unveils its latest batch of devices.</p><p>You’ll be able to follow along with the rest of us as the livestreams will be available both on Samsung’s website and the company’s YouTube channel.</p><p>Over the next few days, we’ll be taking a look at what’s happened in the past year, while also highlighting some of the key leaks and rumors. <br><br>And if you want to get the full picture, be sure to head over and check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 Ultimate Guide</u></a> to learn everything there is to know.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cMS8qECR0A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Shortly after Samsung made the announcement regarding when Unpacked would be taking place, it also opened up its Galaxy Reserve program. All you need to do is provide your email address, and you’ll get $50 in credit, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-to-get-usd1-150-off-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-before-the-phone-even-officially-exists"><u><strong>saving up to $1,150</strong></u></a> on one of the new devices.</p><p>Not only that, but Samsung is also hosting a sweepstakes where you’ll be entered to win $5,000. Pretty wild if you ask me.</p><p>Time flies when you’re having fun, and we can’t believe it’s already been about six months since the last Galaxy Unpacked took place. Since January, we’ve seen an abundance of shiny new devices announced, including a few foldables here and there. Meanwhile, the Galaxy foldable rumor mill hasn’t slowed down, not one bit.</p><p>During Unpacked, Samsung is expected to reveal both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, the obvious successors to the Fold 6 and Flip 6 from last summer. However, there are rumors aplenty that we could see the Galaxy “G Fold,” and Galaxy Z Flip FE. On top of that, the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch Ultra 2 are likely to be announced, in addition to One UI 8 and the latest version of One UI Watch.</p><p>Starting off with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, many of us are hoping to see a meaningful redesign come to Samsung’s book-style foldable. For the most part, the last three generations have basically been spec bumps, while iterative improvements have been made to the hinge.</p><p>At first, this might not seem like all that big of a deal, that is, until you look around at the rest of the market. Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a far cry from the original Pixel Fold, which you might think was designed by a different company. While the OnePlus Open 2 never came to fruition, the Oppo Find N5 is as sleek and svelte as ever, complete with an array of excellent cameras to boot.</p><p>More recently, the Vivo X Fold 5 was unveiled, packed with a 6,000mAh battery and still managing to weigh just 217 grams. For reference, that’s more than 20 grams lighter than the Z Fold 6 with its paltry 4,400mAh battery.</p><p>In late 2024, Samsung did something rather surprising, as the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition was announced. It has a lot of the changes that we were hoping to see from the Fold 6, such as featuring a larger cover screen and a thinner chassis.</p><p>Arguably more importantly, Samsung also upgraded the primary camera, implementing a 200MP sensor compared to the 50MP lens in the Fold 6. Unfortunately, the Z Fold Special Edition was only released in China and Samsung’s home country, South Korea.</p><p>Nevertheless, it proved that Samsung is more than capable of releasing a foldable phone with the upgrades we’ve been clamoring for. Plus, a few of us would venture to guess that the Special Edition provided a glimpse at what’s in store from Unpacked.</p><p>If the leaks and rumors are true, we’re possibly looking at the biggest upgrade ever to the Galaxy Z Fold line. It would at least be on par with the upgrade from the original Galaxy Fold to the Galaxy Z Fold 2, which was pretty massive itself.</p><p>As for those rumors and leaks, Samsung’s latest foldable is said to feature a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8-inch inner display, up from the 6.2-inch and 7.6-inch Z Fold 6 screens. In April, @TheGalox_ claimed the Fold 7 will be “4.5mm unfolded,” however, a more recent rumor from Setsuna Digital suggests it will be 4.2mm when unfolded and 8.9mm when folded.</p><p>If Setsuna Digital is correct, that would give the Fold 7 the title of being the “thinnest foldable phone,” which is currently held by the Oppo Find N5 (4.21mm/8.93mm). What remains to be seen is whether Samsung will also be able to improve the inner display crease.</p><p>Later in April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-folded-profile-speculation-report"><u>more rumors</u></a> seemed to corroborate previous reports of the Z Fold 7 taking the crown for thinnest foldable. More specifically, TechManiacs stated it would be just 8.2mm, while also sporting a “regular smartphone-like” design when folded.</p><p>Unfortunately, if this were to be done, it’s rather likely that Samsung would be dropping the S Pen digitizer. This is how the Z Fold Special Edition was able to be so much thinner than the Z Fold 6, as the digitizer shaves about 0.6mm of thickness from the phone.</p><p>As the calendar flipped into May, yet another report provided further confirmation of just how thin the Z Fold 7 is likely to be. But this time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-might-be-gunning-for-the-crown-as-the-worlds-thinnest-foldable"><u>@UniverseIce</u></a> reaffirmed what we already assumed about the battery of Samsung’s next foldable.</p><p>In order to make the phone thinner, this comes with some obvious sacrifices. The first is the aforementioned removal of the S Pen digitizer, and it seems that the Fold 7 will yet again sport a 4,400mAh cell. Meanwhile, Oppo’s Find N5 is just 8.93mm when folded, yet it packs a sizable 5,600mAh cell. Let’s just hope the processor efficiency has improved to at least give us some type of battery upgrade.</p><p>Fast forward a couple of weeks, and we were graced with what appeared to be our first “real world” look at the Z Fold 7. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-pictured-ahead-of-schedule-amid-rumours-of-titanium-switch.1019434.0.html"><u>only one picture</u></a> and didn’t really do much in the way of answering many questions.</p><p>However, it did give us a look at the rear camera array, and not much else. At the same time, a report claimed that Samsung was developing “a new S Pen that will be compatible with the Galaxy Z Fold7 upon release.” This would make sense if the digitizer is removed, but it will be interesting to see what actually happens.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 6 being an iterative update, Samsung needs to roll out meaningful changes to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to allow the foldable to stand out against its Chinese rivals. Samsung needs to address the width of the cover panel — it continues to be a challenge on its foldables — and put better cameras on the back of the Z Fold 7.</p><p>Galaxy AI is still a differentiator, but Chinese brands made positive strides in this area in the last 12 months, and it will be interesting to see if Samsung showcases any new features coming to the foldable.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is set to retain IP48 ingress protection, which is welcome news. Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, and while the rest of the industry has caught up, it’s good to see that the brand isn’t making any changes in this regard.</p><p>The Flip 7 will have the same durability as well, with Samsung maintaining parity between both devices. The latest devices by Chinese brands include IP58 as standard, and Samsung may look to increase the durability of its foldables next year with the introduction of the Z Fold 8 and Flip 8.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we may not see any major innovation around the design or battery this year, Samsung is set to bring its flagship 200MP camera to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and that’s exciting. Samsung foldables in general don’t have great camera packages, and it’s clear that the brand is looking to change that with the Z Fold 7.</p><p>The 200MP camera is likely to be the same used in the S25 Ultra, and that should allow the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to differentiate itself considerably in this category. We’ll need to wait and see if Samsung rolls out brand-new sensors for the telephoto as well as the wide-angle lenses, because that would make the Z Fold 7 just as good as the Galaxy S series.</p><p>If the latest leak is to be believed, Samsung is set to bring another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/a-new-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak-reveal-massive-cover-screen-in-action">sizable update to the Flip 7</a>. We could get a considerably bigger cover panel, and that has the potential to make the device that much more versatile.</p><p>It’s not just about the increased real estate either; Samsung could be pushing this as a way to showcase Now Bar, giving you real-time status updates. That alone makes the Flip 7 a little bit more interesting, and we don’t have to wait long to see just what changes Samsung is bringing to the diminutive foldable this year.</p><p>Chinese brands are outdoing one another when it comes to ultra-thin foldable designs.  Honor just rolled out the Magic V5, which is just 4.2mm unfolded, and Vivo’s X Fold 5 is just 4.3mm. Samsung is looking to follow suit with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and if initial leaks are any indication, the foldable could be just 4.2mm thick.</p><p>Of course, there’s the small matter of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 likely featuring a much smaller battery than its rivals. Samsung is said to be using the same 4,400mAh battery as last year; the Magic V5 has a 5,820mAh battery, while the X Fold 5 has an even bigger 6,000mAh battery. While it’s admirable that Samsung is aiming to deliver a sleek foldable this time around, there’s no question that a bigger battery would have been a much better choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-accessibility-zooming" alt="Using the upgraded zoom accessibility feature in One UI 8 to see an Android 16 logo on the Android Central website up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Software is likely to be a big talking point at the launch event. Samsung has focused on Galaxy AI as a major point of differentiation, and the brand could share plans on what it has in store with the next iteration of One UI. It has been a contentious year in this regard, with the One UI 7 rollout facing significant delays.</p><p>The Android 16-based One UI 8 will most likely debut alongside the foldables, and it will be interesting to see where Samsung takes Galaxy AI as rivalry intensifies among handset makers. Google dominates this field thanks to a suite of AI features on its Pixels, and Chinese manufacturers are getting in on the action, often teaming up with Google to bring innovative features to their devices, like Honor’s image-to-video generation mode that was introduced on the Honor 400 Pro.</p><p>A side-effect of Samsung chasing ever-thinner designs is that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may miss out on stylus integration entirely.</p><p>It wouldn’t be too astonishing considering Samsung limited the feature-set of the stylus on the Galaxy S25 Ultra earlier this year, disabling its ability to serve as a remote shutter button. We’ll just have to wait and see what Samsung does in this area.</p><p>There definitely seems to be a bit of confusion in the Flip 7 rumor mill, as we're unsure whether Samsung will stick with Qualcomm or rely on the Exynos 2500 chipset. Initially, it was assumed that the Snapdragon 8 Elite would be at the helm, following suit with what we expect from the Fold 7.<br><br>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored"><u>late May</u></a>, an SoC model number was "discovered" in relation to the Exynos 2500, backed by claims that this would be used by all Flip 7 models. It would be a rather surprising change, even when you consider that Samsung moved from Qualcomm to MediaTek with the Galaxy Tab S10 lineup last year.</p><p>About a week later, another report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumors-arent-sure-if-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-will-use-snapdragon-or-exynos"><u>surfaced</u></a> that this wouldn't actually be the case. At least not entirely. The more recent rumor claimed that the Exynos 2500 would be at the helm in every region except for U.S., Canada, and China.</p><p>In doing so, that would mean that the Snapdragon 8 Elite would power the Flip 7 in the aforementioned trio of countries. Meanwhile, any other region where Samsung's flip phone was coming to would opt for the Exynos SoC.</p><p>This could be a make-or-break year for the Galaxy Z Flip series, as it sees continued pressure from other phone makers. Most notably, at least in the U.S., comes from Motorola, which recently released its refreshed Razr series of devices.</p><p>Headlining these is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review"><u>Razr Ultra</u></a>, which introduced an improved hinge and overall design. There's even a dedicated key to interact with Moto AI, something we've yet to see Samsung adopt. That is, unless you count the ability to activate Gemini with the Side Key as an "AI Key."</p><p>However, there is another Samsung foldable phone that has picked up steam in recent months with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Late last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025"><u>display analyst Ross Young reported</u></a> that the budget-friendly flip phone would launch alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7.<br><br>Besides that, details were scarce, other than Young revealing that it would "carry the same display as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review"><u>Galaxy Z Flip 6</u></a> successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><u>Galaxy Z Flip 7</u></a>."</p><p>Young provided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display"><u>further corroboration</u></a> back in January that the Flip 7 FE would re-use the Flip 6's display. This would mean that the FE will sport a Dynamic LTPO AMOLED screen with a 1080 x 2640 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and a peak brightness level of 2600 nits.</p><p>Around the same time, the Flip 7 FE made a surprise appearance on the GSMA database, carrying a model number of SM-F761B. As usually is the case, nothing else was revealed from this listing, besides providing confirmation of its existence.</p><p>While Young got through what the display of the Flip 7 FE might look like, we’ve heard some more chatter about its rear panel. It could also retain the Galaxy Flip 6’s folder-like cover screen, without the end-to-end screen. While it may look like the Galaxy Flip 6, a recent leak from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-specs-leak-next-to-sneak-peek-of-watch-8-models"><u> Roland Quandt stated</u></a> that the affordable FE variant could have the same screen space as the Galaxy Z Flip 7, measuring 4.1 inches when folded and 6.9 inches when unfolded.</p><p>Roland shared the alleged specs of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which indicate that the device’s design could be compact and accessible. It is rumored to come with a 50 MP primary lens, with 128 and 256 GB storage options, and a 4000 mAh battery. While it remains unclear what chipset this FE variant could get, the leak suggests that it will come loaded with Galaxy AI, just like the rest of the lineup.</p><p>If the rumors of a redesigned Fold 7 and Flip 7, along with the rumored Flip FE aren't enough to get everyone excited, Samsung might have something for you. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor"><u>November 2024</u></a>, reports surfaced suggesting Samsung would be releasing a "double-folding" smartphone sometime in 2025.</p><p>This came after Huawei's Mate XT made waves as a phone that unfolded twice, transforming from a 6.4-inch display to a 10.2-inch screen. Reports about Samsung's tri-fold seemed to suggest the screens would fold inward to avoid being "vulnerable to drops and impacts."</p><p>While the most recent rumor about Samsung’s tri-fold wasn’t fully focused on the device, it was spotted in a One UI 8 deep dive by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak"><u>AssembleDebug</u></a>. The rumor notes that Samsung's internal code refers to the device as the "Multifold 7." The number “7” hints at the fact that it could be teased along with the other devices during Unpacked.</p><p>The leak mostly shows support animations for the phone's functions. One animation shows off the trifold's folding process, which sees the left-most portion opening, revealing its full display. The tipster went further, stating that One UI 8's animation suggests Samsung has gone with two "inward-folding" panels. However, the software's animations warn that the two panels aren't of equal size, with the left one smaller than the right, indicating it should be folded in first.</p><p>A detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1942235635081003319"><u>leak of the spec pages</u></a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, and Flip 7 FE highlights what’s in store with Samsung’s 2025 foldables. It shows the Flip 7 and Flip 7 FE touting the Exynos 2500, with the Z Fold 7 powered by Qualcomm instead, suggesting this is a global variant and not the U.S. model.</p><p>What’s interesting is that there doesn’t seem to be much of a difference between the standard Z Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE; both have a similar-sized panel with identical resolution, same cameras and 4,300mAh battery, and internals. The biggest difference is that the FE model gets 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, with the regular version starting out at 12GB/256GB. We’ll have to wait and see if these pan out, but given the timing of the leak, it looks legitimate.</p><p>Interestingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1942235635081003319"><u>latest leak</u></a> reaffirms that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature a 200MP main camera, a huge upgrade over its predecessor. It’s likely Samsung is using the same sensor as the S25 Ultra, and that should allow the Z Fold 7 to take much better photos and videos.</p><p>The auxiliary lenses look to be unchanged, but we’ll know if that’s the case soon enough. The leak also lists Android 16 as the software, so it’s a decent possibility that Samsung will debut its foldables with One UI 8.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then I do both.</p><p>This year will be different; it <em>has</em> to be because I'm broke. Even if I wanted to buy a bunch of gadgety toys, I can't, because a life-changing medical issue and a whole lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/americas-rural-broadband-landscape-will-never-be-good-enough">expensive water damage</a> to my house have left me with no money, maxed credit cards, and bills to pay. The tank is dry, and now I have to fill it up again.</p><p>It's not all bad. I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> that will last me until at least next year, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> that will be updated for a while, and a drawer filled with gadget junk I've already bought that I can tinker with all over again. You never know, I might be able to do something new and cool because ideas are free, and old stuff can be useful sometimes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V8LL5oL4reXnZz4pKfgsUc" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-10" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 in a tented position" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8LL5oL4reXnZz4pKfgsUc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll be buying a bunch of boring household stuff if we can find it in bulk and on a good sale. Stuff like trash bags, laundry detergent, and assorted crap that everyone needs. I figure between Amazon and Walmart — which you know is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-target-deal-days-prime-day-sales">going to have a bunch of stuff on sale</a> to compete — we can actually save a few bucks in the long run by spending it up front. Every penny counts.</p><p>However, I also need to ensure that the things I <em>can't</em> afford to replace will last until I can. I have learned that it's always better to spend a few dollars in advance to try and prevent breaking or losing your stuff, which will cost a lot of money to replace. Things like phones.

Usually we buy a new phone because we either <em>really</em> wanted one or because the one we have stopped working.

While we don't have much information about what is happening in the back end, Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this potential probe by the U.S. Commerce Department but did not hear back in time for publication.

However, the renders show arms of the smartglasses slightly wider, especially toward the lenses, and the front seems to have a higher aesthetic toward the sides, giving the smartglasses a butterfly effect.</p><p>This leak also gave us a look at Meta's rumored sEMG bracelet, which is designed to be a necessary input partner for the glasses. In a separate post, Luna claims that Meta could end up ditching the  Hypernova or simply using Ray-Ban Meta again, and these glasses could launch as the "Meta Celeste."</p><h2 id="samsung-s-tri-fold-shows-up-in-a-one-ui-8-leak-2">Samsung's Tri-fold shows up in a One UI 8 leak</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Samsung is gearing up to launch its newest foldables early next week; however, a One UI 8 leak may have tipped off the existence of a tri-fold phone showing up along with the rest of the line-up.</p><p>The trifold, rumored previously as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">Galaxy G Fold</a>," was spotted in a One UI 8 deep dive by tipster AssembleDebug. However, as the post notes, Samsung's internal code refers to the device as the "Multifold 7."</p><p>The leak mostly shows support animations for the phone's functions. One animation shows off the trifold's folding process, which sees the left-most portion opening, revealing its full display. The tipster went further, stating that One UI 8's animation suggests Samsung has gone with two "inward-folding" panels. However, the software's animations warn that the two panels aren't of equal size, with the left one smaller than the right, indicating it should be folded in first.</p><p>This is also backed by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

low-light. Digital zoom quality actually somewhat compensates for the lack of a telephoto camera. While both phones offer lossless zoom at 2x, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes the lead at higher zoom ranges, maintaining a good level of detail even at 10x, whereas the Razr Ultra struggles.</p><p>Then there are low-light and nighttime images. Samsung does its best to brighten up photos, which can sometimes result in decent images. However, it can also overdo it, and images will come out fairly noisy, and as a result, images can look worse than those taken on the Razr Ultra 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-05.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But beyond picture quality, I've enjoyed actually <em>using </em>the cameras. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">The flip phone form factor enhances your camera experience</a> with its versatility, allowing you to capture selfies from the cover screen or enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-first-things#section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and">Camcorder Mode</a> for quick, easy, and stable video recording.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung continues to hide a ton of useful camera settings in its Camera Assistant app, which doesn't come preinstalled.

Samsung continues to hinder the cover screen experience in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5."</p><p>Derrek Lee, 'Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review'</p></blockquote></div><p>The cover screen experience on Samsung's Z Flip series has come a long way, particularly since the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>. The 3.4-inch external display carried over to the Z Flip 6, giving users more robust cover screen panels, messaging, full camera previews, and more. Yet, despite having all this room for activities, Samsung still hides and hinders its best cover screen features.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">I tested the Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> to see how I would fare using only the cover screen for 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus</a> offered a much better experience, thanks to the larger 4-inch screen, the ability to use apps out of the box, cover screen multitasking, a more connected experience overall when it comes to app transitions across displays, and the way notifications are handled.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is unfortunately hindered by its smaller and awkwardly shaped display and the fact that the use of apps on the cover screen is still not "officially" supported. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, you must go through Good Lock to enable an app panel, and even then, the experience feels half-baked.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 (left) and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cover screen is limited to the Samsung Keyboard, and it occupies nearly the entire screen when in use. Multitasking is non-existent, so you have to fully exit an app before opening another. Furthermore, Samsung's decision to avoid placing the cameras <em>on</em> the cover panel results in an awkward screen shape, and the experience of using apps feels a bit claustrophobic.</p><p>In my experience, the lack of apps on the cover screen hasn't been a dealbreaker for people who I've met who use the Z Flip 5 or 6. In fact, after I show them that they <em>can </em>add apps, it feels more like a nice bonus for them, which somewhat works in Samsung's favor.</p><p>That said, it's not all bad, and there have been signs that Samsung is learning. As mentioned earlier, the cover screen enables some unique camera tricks that you won't find on a traditional candybar phone. Samsung also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">added a new button with One UI 7</a> that somewhat streamlines the option to add cover screen apps, which is a step in the right direction.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-6-is-still-great-but-what-comes-next-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still great, but what comes next?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-26.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4206" height="2366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A year later, I still prefer Motorola's Razr series to Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6. That said, it remains a great choice for flip phone lovers, such as myself. It's a sturdy, well-built phone with impressive specs and plenty of helpful and fun AI features. I also <em>love </em>One UI 7, and I'm not afraid to admit that I'd rather have it on the Razr than Motorola's Hello UX. Plus, with 7 years of updates, the phone should provide plenty of value for years to come as new features and capabilities are added over time.</p><p>And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day</a> right around the corner, it's never been a better time to snag one at a discount, as there are already some pretty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">impressive Samsung deals</a> out there, especially if you want a 512GB Z Flip 6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="889bab6a-2f1b-4610-b774-3ff9e9af3b7f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The 512GB Galaxy Z Flip 6 typically costs a pretty penny, and more than I would recommend anyone pay for this phone.

That's why comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> wasn't as cut-and-dry as you'd expect. One was a notable step forward that really focused on design and the cover screen experience, while the other was more of a spec bump that focused more on performance. That's why it feels like there's so much riding on the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7, as it may finally introduce the features we've been hoping for.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung is expected to introduce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7#section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-finally-a-cheaper-flip-phone">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, which is rumored to be a more affordable flip phone option (at least compared to the Z Flip 7). If rumors are correct, this phone could offer a nearly identical design to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, albeit with an Exynos chipset, which could complicate the Galaxy Z Flip 6's place in the lineup.</p><p>However, if getting the latest and greatest Samsung phone isn't for you, I'm confident that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will be more than sufficient for most users, even in 2025.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone has an all-new design, better internals, UFS 4.0 storage, bigger battery, and a brighter AMOLED panel.</p><p>The GT 30 Pro costs ₹24,999 ($292) in India for the standard 8GB/256GB model, and there's a 12GB/256GB edition that's available for ₹26,999 ($316). The phone is trying to undercut the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a>, and that's no small feat.

There are four RGB lighting zones — which is always nice to see — and you get aggressive styling at the back with laser-etched designs underneath the polycarbonate back. The mid-frame is made out of polycarbonate as well, and while you don't get the same premium feel as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-10s-pro-review">Redmagic 10S Pro</a>, the device is lighter than its predecessor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qTWw9hTcitn2HTxdyBHamK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTWw9hTcitn2HTxdyBHamK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's an oblong camera island at the back, and its positioning on the left means there is a wobble when using the GT 30 Pro on a table.

Obviously, you won't get a camera as good as the Pixel 9a in this category, but considering what it costs, the GT 30 Pro has a good shooter overall. The auxiliary 8MP wide-angle is average, but it is more useful than the pitiful 2MP macro lens Infinix tacked on to the back of the GT 20 Pro last year.</p><h2 id="decent-software-with-a-caveat-2">Decent software — with a caveat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GT 30 Pro runs Infinix's XOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the interface doesn't have too much in the way of overt customization. It is good to use and optimized to take advantage of the MediaTek hardware, but it is buggy at times. You don't get quite as much customizability as POCO devices, and like every other manufacturer, Infinix has a suite of AI utilities.</p><p>What's annoying is that the device will get just two software updates.

The post alleges the next V Flip is expected to see an upgrade in one department: its battery. DCS claims Honor is preparing a 1,770mAh and 3,600mAh battery setup inside the V Flip 2. Come launch, there's speculation that the market could see its battery capacity rated at around 5,500mAh.</p><p>It's charging still seems to be up in the air, as DCS suggests Chinese consumers could see 66W or 80W wired charging capabilities.</p><p>If you're expecting other major upgrades, that might not happen. DCS states that the V Flip 2 "has not changed much" from the clamshell's first appearance in 2024. Supposedly, the phone will still retain its 4-inch FHD Plus cover and 6.8-inch internal displays.</p><p>The post states Honor is reportedly chasing a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 series chip. The device could sport a 50MP dual camera array. Lastly, the tipster alleges that Honor is seeking an August 2025 release date for the Magic V Flip 2.</p><h2 id="looks-like-the-magic-v5-got-all-the-magic-2">Looks like the Magic V5 got all the...

The clamshell launched last June, essentially preparing to take on Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 the month after. The device launched with a 4-inch cover and a 6.8-inch internal display, which we've seen rumored once again for its sequel. While the camera looks to remain the same, too, the battery might see a boost over the original's 4,800mAh setup.</p><p>What's more, Honor's alleged choice to grab a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 chip echoes what it did last year. The O.G. V Flip debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1.</a> The chip was a "refresh" of the flagship 8 Gen 1 that launched the fall prior—in 2021. So, Honor went for a two-year-old chip. With rumors claiming that Honor will do it again—"again" meaning a sub-flagship chip—perhaps we're looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</a></p><p>We'll have to wait and see where things lie, especially if we're to expect this phone in a month.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor revealed its Magic V5</a> this week. The company's thinnest-ever foldable is a sleek new piece of competition for Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. When folded, the phone measures 8.8mm (4.1mm when opened). Display-wise, Honor outfits the phone with a 7.9-inch internal display and a 6.4-inch cover screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims the Pixel Watch 4 will be available in a 41mm and a 45mm option. The company is also preparing the following color/band color choices: Black/Obsidian, Gold/Lemon, Silver/Porcelain, Silver/Iris, and Moonstone.</p><p>What's unclear is if both size options will see the same color options. If we remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">the Pixel Watch 3</a>, its 41mm and 45mm options don't feature the same stylistic choices, as the former tosses in a Champagne color and even a Rose band.</p><p>Regarding the next-gen bands, the tipster states the Pixel Watch 4 will see a multitude (roughly seven) bands with different colors. The Woven band is rumored to arrive in Indigo, while the two-tone leather option could see a Jade choice. There's an Active Band (Iris, Lemongrass, Moonstone), an Active Sports Band (Indigo, Lemongrass, Moonstone, Peony), and a Classic Leather in Moonstone.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead-to-the-pixel-watch-4-2">Looking Ahead to the Pixel Watch 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Pixel Watch 4:WiFi/LTE41mm/45mmBlack/ObsidianGold/LemonMoonstoneSilver/IrisSilver/Porcelain<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1941026391648358465">July 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Metal Mesh band could debut in Matte Black and Polished Silver, leaving the Performance Loop in Moonstone.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster alleges the following Gradient Stretch band options in sizes one through five:</p><ul><li>Lemongrass/Frost</li><li>Moonstone</li><li>Obsidian/Hazel</li><li>Peony/Iris</li></ul><p>Pixel Watch 4 rumors have been light so far; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">a massive render leak</a> from April left us a little impressed. The supposed images showed off a watch that is looking to improve its display experience. The Pixel Watch 4 may sport thinner bezels under the circular domed glass aesthetic that's become enjoyable. There were some alleged changes, like the removal of its charging pogo pins.</p><p>It's left to speculation to believe that Google is working on introducing a wireless charging method for its next watch. Elsewhere, the rumored renderings showcased two extra cutouts on either side of the device's speaker, likely for its physical buttons.</p><p>One concerning aspect was the Watch 4's supposed thickness increase; however, that could be a result of a bigger battery.</p><p>This is also the second time we've heard a tipster claim the watch will arrive in 41mm and 45mm options, so perhaps there's merit. Either way, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 4 to debut alongside the Pixel 10 series, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">could take place in late August</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been using an Apple Watch user for a while now, starting with a Series 6 and later upgrading to a Series 8 when it was released three years ago. So for about five years now, I've had a bulky square-ish dial on my wrist- and I still do, as I type this article. On the flip side, I've owned the Oura Ring 4 for only about 3 weeks now, and it has become this silent source of encouragement pushing me to take care of myself while I go about my life.</p><p>As a first-time mom, my sleep cycle has been erratic, to say the least, with frequent nightly wake-ups to feed my infant. This is exactly why I needed to know if I was getting optimal rest and if my health was truly supporting my ability to function during the day. This was the primary reason behind trying out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, which, when compared to a smartwatch, is manageable to sleep with.</p><p>Now, I use the Oura Ring 4 all the time as an overall health tracker, while the Apple Watch sticks to being my fitness companion.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th: check out our ultimate guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-nonsense-sleep-tracking-2">No-nonsense sleep tracking</h2><p>While setting up my Oura Ring, the app asked me a bunch of questions to determine whether I had any special circumstances or health issues that could impact my readings, to which I ticked off the option of having small kids at home, acknowledging the fact that this could affect my sleep score.</p><p>For instance, after a night of only about 5.7 hours of sleep, my Oura Ring app presented a detailed picture of my breathing patterns and heart rate, in addition to the standard awake time, REM sleep, deep sleep, and so on. This analysis put things into perspective for me, and the app gave me suggestions as to how I could avoid a long afternoon nap so I could get my sleep cycle back in sync, asking me to wind down during the night with a book or a quick mindfulness session, or taking steps to improve my sleep quality at night. While the advice didn't stem from the fact that I was frequently waking up because my infant needed me, it did give me actionable items that helped me understand my sleep scores better.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 tracks sleep using a special "Smart sensing" technology that involves a combination of advanced sensors that are fitted into the ring, along with machine-learning algorithms that are specifically trained to track different stages of sleep. It also has sensors that track your oxygen, heart, and respiratory rate to understand how your body functions when you sleep.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Sleep tracking on Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="oura-s-ai-powered-advisor-2">Oura's AI-powered Advisor </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4 Stress detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who is constantly juggling multiple responsibilities — from managing my role as a News editor, and also navigating the unpredictable challenges that come with having an infant, stress can easily become something that goes under the radar, manifesting as a headache or just pure anxiety, as I transition between home and work, without a moment to myself.</p><p>This is when Oura's AI-powered Advisor comes into play. The sensors constantly monitor my physiological state, and when the smart ring tracks that I'm experiencing elevated levels of stress based on my heart rate variability (HRV), the app instantly sends me a quick notification to take a look at the stats and possibly step back and "breathe the stress away" with a quick four-minute mindfulness session that gives me the much needed moment of calm amidst the daily chaos.</p><p>Beyond that, the Oura Ring 4 also doubles as a subtle activity coach. Instead of constantly bugging me with reminders to "close rings", it gently nudges me to get in 3-4 minutes of movement when it detects longer periods of inactivity.  While I still track my workouts with the Watch, these soft reminders from the Oura Advisor actually play a crucial role in keeping me on track with my fitness goals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Oura annouces new features to track meals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While those were the main reasons why I primarily use the Oura Ring 4, I sometimes also track my steps with it when I don't have my watch on. However, another cool feature that I'm currently experimenting with is "Meals," a super-easy way to keep track of what you're eating in a day. Unlike traditional food tracking apps that require users to manually input data, which again is time-consuming to me, all I have to do is take a picture of my plate, and this AI feature will break things down for me. It shows me each "Meal Item" and the nutrients my plate contains, helping me reach for healthier options.</p><p>So if you're a first-time mom juggling work and the challenges that come with having a tiny human at home, then this ring-sized motivator is for you. It will keep track of your sleep, stress, and sanity. The best part is that you don't have to reach for the charger as often as you would for an Apple Watch, as it offers up to 8 days of battery on a single charge.</p><p>While the Oura Ring 4 (starting around $349) is on the more expensive side, it's worth noting that the Oura Ring 3 has currently crashed back to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Tracking-Wearable-Fitness/dp/B0D9WVSZ56"><strong>lowest price at Amazon ahead of Prime Day,</strong></a> offering a more accessible entry point into Oura's excellent tracking capabilities.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.27%;"><img id="JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5" name="oura-ring-gen-3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1249" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 (Heritage Silver):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.00</del> <strong>$199.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Days before <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Prime Day</a> officially kicks off on July 8th, buyers can get $50 off the Oura Ring 3 smart ring, representing a 20% discount on a great last-generation device.

For a good chunk of the past year, the Z Fold 6 has either been my primary or secondary phone, only being swapped out with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Despite being a huge fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 just didn't spark the same level of excitement that I've felt elsewhere. I've already written about how Samsung played it safe with an iterative design, only to release a more modern iteration with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Z Fold Special Edition</a>, which was limited to a handful of regions.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-problem-2">What's the problem?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qetCRBRLHzRwPwfLRJywv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qetCRBRLHzRwPwfLRJywv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that, for the most part, the Fold 6 has been the phone that I keep coming back to, time and time again. I revisited the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember">OnePlus Open</a> in anticipation of an Open 2 that never arrived, but still ended up back on the Samsung train. The only phone that has managed to pull me away has been the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-on-the-right-track-with-desktop-mode-in-android-16">Desktop Mode has arrived with Android 16</a>.</p><p>Why is that a problem? When you see phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and even the Huawei Mate XT being released, the Z Fold 6 simply looks outdated. It's kind of like how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> looked like it was supposed to originally launch in 2020, but for whatever reason, was held back until 2023.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the Z Fold Special Edition was basically proof that Samsung could release a modern foldable with better cameras, a bigger screen, and all of the things I've been hoping for. So when we see reports and rumors about sales figures being down, it doesn't come as a shock, considering that it's really just Samsung, Google, and Motorola in the space, at least until we get a proper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open successor.</a></p><h2 id="why-do-i-keep-coming-back-2">Why do I keep coming back?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if the hardware and specs are such a letdown, why do I keep coming back to the Z Fold 6 at all? Everything else.</p><p>The thing about this phone is that if I really had to, I could use this for literally everything. Its narrow cover screen is great for doom-scrolling or replying to messages, and if I need more space to spread out, I can just unfold it. If I need to sketch something out or jot down a note, I can just grab an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen</a> and be on my way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need even more space? Then I can plug in my handy-dandy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a> and turn the Fold 6 into a laptop via DeX. And if I'm <em>really</em> in a pinch, then I can pair my Samsung ultrawide monitor with the Fold 6 and use DeX that way. But that's more a last-ditch effort kind of thing since DeX doesn't really play nice with ultrawide monitors.</p><p>And when it comes to multi-tasking <em>without</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX</a>, Samsung has my current favorite implementation. Basically, there aren't any major limitations. I'm able to have more than two or three apps appear on the screen, and can easily swap them out or just pull up a floating window. Admittedly, the only time I do that is to access my password manager or if I'm watching football while checking fantasy scores.</p><h2 id="surprising-discovery-2">Surprising discovery</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens-angled.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one thing I've noticed regarding the design, and it's that I'm much more likely to use the inner screen on the Fold 6 than the other foldable phones I have. It's not like I can't do anything from the cover screen, but it's simply too narrow.</p><p>That's not the case with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which features the same 6.3-inch display as the Pixel 9 Pro. I'd be lying if I said that there haven't been days when I don't use the inner screen on the 9 Pro Fold. But unless my memory is failing me, I can't remember a day when I didn't unfold the Z Fold 6 at least once.</p><p>Naturally, I'll be paying closer attention to this once I get my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, provided that the rumors and leaks are true about the larger screens.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-awful-2">Battery life is awful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-battery-settings" alt="Battery settings on Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gripes about the hardware aside, that's not the only area that Samsung needs to improve on. Battery life on the Fold 6 has been absolutely atrocious. More often than not, it won't last until the early evening without needing to be charged to make it through the rest of the day.</p><p>Obviously, a foldable is a bit different when compared to a slab phone, but surely Samsung knows that this isn't good enough. I'm not even talking about charging speeds, but having the 4,400mAh battery is the smallest of the other recent foldable phones. Vivo recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-bridging-the-gap-android-apple-watch-launch">X Fold 5</a> and managed to squeeze a 6,000mAh battery, while the Find N5 offers a 5,600mAh cell.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand there are ways to try and remedy this, but I didn't take any of those approaches. For one, it's extremely annoying and time-consuming to reset and restore a phone, especially one that you've been using for the better part of a year. More importantly, I would have to assume that the majority of people don't wipe and restore their phones once a year, so I decided against doing so.</p><p>Everything was fine in the beginning, easily making it through a day. But less than a year later, the Fold 6 barely lasts eight hours, and that's just unacceptable.</p><h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on top of Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's kind of a weird thing, as I've been trying to gather my thoughts and feelings, but just coming back to the same conclusion: I'm beyond ready for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Samsung was once at the top of the mountain when it came to foldable phones, but stood pat while the competition ran circles around them.</p><p>All of the leaks and rumors suggest that Samsung will be implementing quite a few new changes. I'm of the mindset that it'll basically be the Z Fold Special Edition, with newer internals while hopefully retaining S Pen compatibility. And even with all of these supposed changes, there's a chance that the Fold 7 might not even be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak">star of the show</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e60ce6f5-a5db-4c60-9dc2-a492de3f6dcc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 really is a Swiss Army Knife, as it can pretty much do whatever you want.

The company has confirmed a mandatory update landing soon that’ll rein in your battery once it hits around 400 charge cycles in order to keep the phone from running too hot and steer clear of any meltdown-level surprises.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16340779" target="_blank">community post</a>, Google gave Pixel 6a owners a heads-up about a mandatory <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update rolling out starting July 8 intended to deliver "important battery management features" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/07/02/google-clears-all-pixel-6a-factory-images/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>The upcoming update takes place only if your phone is flagged as an “Impacted Device.” If you’re on that list, your battery capacity and charging speed will take a slight hit to prevent potential overheating.</p><h2 id="only-some-phones-are-affected-2">Only some phones are affected</h2><p>Google hasn’t exactly spelled out what makes a Pixel 6a an “Impacted Device,” but the guess is it comes down to differences in battery or charging hardware. Some units might have slight variations in components that make them more prone to overheating, so the upcoming battery limits are likely aimed at keeping those specific phones in check.</p><p>If your Pixel 6a falls under Google’s Impacted Device label, expect a mandatory battery tweak coming with the Android 16 update. Affected phones will see a noticeable drop in battery life.</p><p>If your Pixel 6a isn’t on the list, you’ve got nothing to worry about. The Android 16 update’s still coming your way on July 8, but your battery and charging speeds will stay just the way they are.</p><p>This battery update is Google’s response to earlier reports of Pixel 6a units running dangerously hot, including a few cases where phones reportedly caught fire. By dialing down battery voltage, the update aims to stop those issues before they happen again.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e2rAyZSRn4dBPRitNqvkaT" name="Google-Pixel-6a-camera-bar-back-angle-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2rAyZSRn4dBPRitNqvkaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="deja-vu-for-pixel-4a-owners-2">Déjà vu for Pixel 4a owners</h2><p>Not long ago, Google slashed the Pixel 4a’s battery capacity with a surprise update, and now it’s the Pixel 6a’s turn.

Your Pixel 6a has to hit 400 full charge cycles before anything changes. And if you're getting close, you’ll get a heads-up at 375 cycles so you’re not caught off guard.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re not thrilled about the upcoming battery limits, Google is giving a few compensation options, including free battery swaps or even a cash payout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, one that has been rising up the ranks lately is Nothing. The British company founded by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, makes products that are distinctive in design and that are finding their way to the North American market. In fact, the Phone 3 is one of two<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-shares-more-details-on-us-and-canada-presence-of-phone-3"> </a>Nothing devices to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-shares-more-details-on-us-and-canada-presence-of-phone-3">officially available and on sale in the U.S.</a> from the brand, with guaranteed compatibility with all U.S. networks.</p><p>So, if you’re looking for a solid Android phone that won’t break the bank, you might be considering the new Nothing Phone 3 or even last year’s Google Pixel 9. Both are great choices, but they are night and day in some ways. This Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9 comparison will help you decide.</p><h2 id="nothing-phone-3-vs-google-pixel-9-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9: Looks and basics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx" name="nothing-phone-3-official-black-and-white" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YEAJkDKT38T8rqmJ9Yxx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to looks, there’s no doubt that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Nothing Phone 3</a>, as with Nothing’s other products, stands out. It employs the company’s signature translucent design. However, it has a new iteration of the Glyph interface called Glyph Matrix, which features a micro LED screen on the back instead of a series of LEDs arranged across the back. This is an actual functional screen that can subtly show details like battery life, stopwatch, mirror, digital clock, solar clock, and even Bespoke games.</p><p>Like the traditional glyph interface found in other Nothing phones, it also offers progress indicators and contact notifications to help minimize distractions. With an SDK published for the Glyph Matrix, you might see other games made available from third-party companies that can leverage this back screen in the future.</p><p>The phone comes in white or black with Nothing’s signature transparent-like design and a 6.67-inch flexible AMOLED screen that boasts 1,260 x 2,800 pixel resolution, 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 4,500 nits peak brightness for viewability even in direct sunlight. Covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, it also comes with a pre-applied screen protector, a nice and appreciated touch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9McZxgmYQPaA827As7uZ33" name="nothing-phone-3-official-lifestyle-01" alt="Official imagery of the Nothing Phone 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9McZxgmYQPaA827As7uZ33.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Available with either 256GB or 512GB storage, the phone meets IP68 certification for water and dust resistance and comes with a pair of HD mics, stereo speakers, and a fingerprint sensor.</p><p>The 5,150mAh battery (5,500mAh in India only) lasts all day and supports 65W fast wired charging as well as 15W wireless charging.

The primary sensor includes optical image stabilization (OIS), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3s-periscope-lens-in-its-latest-tease">the periscope camera</a> has OIS with 3x optical zoom and 60x ultra zoom, and the front-facing camera has a 114-degree field-of-view, ideal for group selfies.</p><p>It leverages a TrueLens Engine 4, affording features like Ultra XDR, auto tone, portrait optimizer, motion capture mode, night mode, macro mode, and action mode.

While the Google Pixel 9 doesn’t have a telephoto camera, Lee says he didn’t really miss it.</p><p>The standout for the cameras with the Google Pixel 9 is all the AI goodies thrown in for helping you capture and edit amazing photos.

When comparing the Nothing Phone 3 vs. Google Pixel 9, it really comes down to design and brand preference. The two phones are equal in many ways, including affordability, features, and specs.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 has a leg up on the Google Pixel 9 in a few ways when it comes to specs alone, including more RAM and storage with the 512GB edition, a larger and higher-res screen, higher brightness, a bigger battery with faster charging, and a better front camera. But these aren’t small details; they can be deciding factors for some.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9, however, provides an unmatched AI experience with Google Gemini, impacting everything from productivity to entertainment and photo capture. From a modern phone perspective, it’s the best value you’ll find for an AI-powered phone at a reasonable price.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3867px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2TMTeyPhE9UQt7sKZ6LjBW" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-12.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 on its side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2TMTeyPhE9UQt7sKZ6LjBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3867" height="2175" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Phone 3 has, of course, its cool and distinctive design with the standout new Glyph interface. The back screen can be useful and help you reduce distractions since you can see essential details without turning the phone over to view the main screen. The Essential Space is also a helpful way to keep you apprised of things without unlocking and diving into other things on the phone. The Google Pixel 9 is an attractive phone, but by comparison, it looks ordinary. With that said, you might prefer it.</p><p>Since both offer seven years of security updates, you’re safe with either choice when it comes to longevity and resale value. You do get an extra two years of OS upgrades with the Google Pixel 9, but that’s really only one year now since the phone launched last year.</p><p>Bottom line: if you like the idea of being different and sporting a funky phone that will turn heads and spark conversation, the Nothing Phone 3 has solid specs that rival those of the Google Pixel 9. If you want something simpler in design that still sports impressive specs at a good price, and will bring you into the world of AI, the Google Pixel 9 is still one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">the best small phones</a> you can buy.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f2d81c5e-958e-47f9-afb6-0e7a2f55d2cc">            <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3" data-model-name="Nothing Phone 3" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's more than nothing</strong></em></p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is more than just a funky phone that will turn heads.

With 4th of July festivities underway, U.S. skies are about to pop with color from fireworks shows across the country. In fact, some fireworks shows are already starting early and will continue through the weekend.</p><p>If you plan on taking photos of the bright skies, you'll be happy to know that your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phone</a> is more than capable of capturing the moment. However, simply pointing your phone camera at the sky and shooting photos won't lead to the best results. You need to tweak your phone's camera settings and add accessories if you have them to get the perfect shot.</p><p>These are the top five tips and tricks every Android phone user should know about snapping firework photos ahead of the 4th of July weekend.</p><h2 id="use-a-tripod-for-stabilization-2">Use a tripod for stabilization </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="De4mBTZXxZBqq8h2AQc8rV" name="Peak-Design-Mobile-Tripod.jpg" alt="A Pixel phone on a Peak Design Mobile Tripod." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/De4mBTZXxZBqq8h2AQc8rV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Firework photos can be tricky to capture, and for good reason. When fireworks explode into the night sky, your phone is trying to capture insanely bright colors in a dark environment. Computational photography in smartphones is advanced, but it can still struggle in situations like this. It needs to figure out how much light to take in while capturing moving objects.</p><p>Holding your phone steady is the most important way to make sure your fireworks photos don't turn out blurry or grainy. If you have a tripod, you should use it. I prefer the Peak Design Mobile Tripod — it's compact and stable.</p><p>However, you don't need to spend a bunch of money to stabilize your phone camera. Think about whether you have a phone case with a kickstand, a battery bank that doubles as a phone stand, or a phone wallet that can prop up your device. Anything that can provide extra stabilization will do, so use what you have. If you do want to buy a dedicated solution, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">a guide to the best phone tripods</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, if you have a flip phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, then you probably won't need one, as you can just place it on a flat surface and angle the top portion of the screen. Big foldables such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will work in a similar fashion. It's your own built-in tripod!</p><h2 id="manually-control-your-exposure-2">Manually control your exposure </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lighting is the key to whether your phone takes great firework photos or obnoxiously bad ones. That doesn't mean you should turn on the flash — it'll do more harm than good. Instead, you'll need to manually control your phone's exposure setting. This will dictate how much light the camera captures, preventing overexposed and grainy shots.</p><p>If that sounds hard, don't worry, it isn't. In fact, you're probably already doing it. You can easily set the exposure by tapping and holding the brightest part of the screen in your camera's viewfinder and watching the exposure self-correct. During a fireworks show, you'll want to point the phone at the sky, tap one of the exploding fireworks, and lock the exposure level in place. This way, you'll only have to do it once for the entire show.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dmDtvregzsdAPzytNesRag" name="Samsung-Camera-Lock-Exposure" alt="Setting manual exposure on the Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmDtvregzsdAPzytNesRag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a Pixel phone, tapping and holding on the brightest part of your screen until you see a lock icon appear will set the exposure level. Samsung Galaxy users should tap and hold until the exposure UI appears, where they can manually drag the exposure slider and press the lock icon to set it. In this type of situation, less brightness (exposure) is better — the fireworks will do the job of lighting up the sky for you.</p><h2 id="use-night-or-astrophotography-modes-2">Use night or astrophotography modes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-4" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris using the Pixel Camera app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You might prefer to set your exposure manually, but alternatively, night mode can be a simpler way to prepare your phone camera for fireworks shows. Night modes are designed to lengthen the exposure time, resulting in a sharper image. This can be a good thing, but the longer exposure time means stabilization is even more important — you'll really want to use a tripod or phone stand in this mode.</p><p>On a Google Pixel phone, you can activate night mode by swiping through the Pixel Camera app modes until you find <strong>Night Sight</strong>. Samsung Galaxy phone users will need to swipe until they see a <strong>More</strong> tab, and then tap <strong>Night</strong>.</p><p>If your phone has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control">astrophotography mode</a>, you can try capturing firework photos with this toggle. Some users have had a lot of success taking firework shots with this mode, but it really wasn't designed with this purpose in mind, so we wouldn't recommend using it for <em>all</em> your shots.

Videos are far more flexible than photos for a few reasons. For starters, you can take photos <em>while</em> recording your video, so you get the best of both worlds. It's also possible to grab a specific frame from a video after the fact to use as a standalone photo. Finally, you can adjust exposure while recording a video by tapping the screen.</p><p>For all these reasons, videos might give you the best chance at getting a great photo if you're overwhelmed by all the settings and options in this guide. It'll simply give you more source material to work with, and sometimes, finding the perfect firework shot is a numbers game.</p><p>While there are a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">great Android camera phones</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> and Galaxy S25 series are probably best suited for fireworks photography.

Not only do you have to contend with different categories of glasses (AI glasses, smart display glasses, true wireless glasses, etc), but you also have to consider whether your devices work properly with your choice of glasses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> are typically plug-and-play, but a few companies like to make things difficult.</p><p>I'm looking at you, Nintendo. With the Switch 2, Nintendo has yet again made it impossible to plug a pair of smart glasses directly into the system and play, even though the company included a perfectly good top-mounted USB-C port.</p><p>Thankfully, I've tested dozens of smart glasses and know exactly what combination you need to play your Switch 2 games on the go with a gorgeous OLED display right in front of your face — no neck pain involved! I've also tested them on several other systems and handhelds, including the Steam Deck, PS5, and plenty of smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

This problem existed with the original Nintendo Switch and, unfortunately, means that you'll likely always need some kind of adapter or dock plugged into your Switch 2 to use a pair of smart glasses with it.</p><p>Thankfully, Viture's got your back. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D3LT6BJW/">Viture Pro Mobile Dock</a> can be plugged into your Switch 2, tricking the system into thinking it's plugged into a TV. You'll then plug a pair of smart glasses into the Viture dock and enjoy gaming on a giant virtual screen. As a bonus, this dock has a 10,000mAh power bank built in, so you'll get several additional hours of gameplay compared to the Switch 2's normal battery life.</p><p>Of course, like with anything involving Nintendo hardware, you'll have to take an extra step to get things working properly the first time around. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Once you get your Viture Pro Mobile Dock, you'll want to visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://static.viture.com/dfu-util/viture-pro-mobile-dock.html"><strong>Viture firmware update page</strong></a><strong> </strong>on a PC or Mac using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome or Edge are fine).</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Plug the mobile dock into your computer using the short USB-C cable that came with your Viture dock, then click the <strong>connect button</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Select <strong>Mobile Dock</strong> from the pop-up list of devices and click <strong>connect</strong>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Select the firmware that says <strong>For Switch 2 Only</strong> from the list of available firmware versions. As of this writing, that is version 2.01.03.0.02_20250613.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Click the <strong>update button</strong> to switch your Viture Pro Mobile Dock over to the Switch 2-compatible firmware.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> If it was successful, you'll see a pop-up message that says <strong>"Your firmware is now on the selected version."</strong></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.70%;"><img id="ZjRjpeNMP4Ex42R2w4LxCd" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-switch-2-firmware-update-how-to" alt="How to switch your Viture Pro Mobile Dock's firmware over to the Switch 2-compatible version" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjRjpeNMP4Ex42R2w4LxCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2442" height="1873" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, your Viture Pro Mobile Dock has the right security keys to work with the Switch 2.

The firmware update website tells you which version works with the original Switch, so just follow the above steps and swap out the firmware with the other version if you need to do that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n6w5K8Q7m4C3ogo6dp5YXd" name="Viture-XR-Pro-Glasses-Pro-Mobile-Dock-and-Switch-2" alt="The Nintendo Switch 2 sitting face downward with the Viture Pro Mobile Dock sitting atop it and Viture Pro XR glasses sitting above it, wired to the Dock." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6w5K8Q7m4C3ogo6dp5YXd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Time to pick your smart glasses! Viture obviously hopes that you'll use its smart glasses with its dock, but this dock is designed to be a universal accessory that works with any glasses or monitor you plug into it. My recommendation is to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">RayNeo Air 3S</a>, as these are the least expensive smart glasses you can buy and offer 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels, making them an excellent choice for your wallet <em>and</em> your eyes.</p><p>While I might normally recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3LRH8G4">Viture Pro smart glasses</a>, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">has a new pair coming soon</a> that you should probably wait for. At the very least, a new pair of glasses should mean the older pair sees a good discount.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z5kUdK86Erw4NpWtRtcND8" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-with-viture-xreal-rayneo-glasses" alt="The Viture One Mobile Dock surrounded by several pairs of smart display glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5kUdK86Erw4NpWtRtcND8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Air glasses also seem to work fine with the dock, but for some reason, Xreal One and Xreal One Pro don't. You'll just end up with a yellow and red display on these if you try to plug them in. As these products are made by different companies, it's not terribly surprising to see incompatibilities from time to time.</p><p>Xreal has a product coming later this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xreal/comments/1l85w66/new_xreal_neo_battery_pack_with_video_passthrough/">called Xreal Neo</a> that works quite similarly to the Viture Pro Mobile Dock, except that it won't need its firmware switched to work with all systems. Yes, that includes a Switch 2. At the least, if you already have a pair of Xreal One glasses and don't fancy buying another pair just to work with your Switch 2, I'd recommend waiting until the Xreal Neo adapter comes out later this year to get things working.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-glasses-for-the-steam-deck-rog-ally-lenovo-legion-etc"><span>Best smart glasses for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion, etc.</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX" name="steam-deck-xreal-one-pro" alt="A Steam Deck and Xreal One Pro glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Steam Deck, ROG Ally, etc, are all essentially just portable computers that are ready to be plugged into a monitor or TV for bigger play. In this case, we're plugging a pair of smart glasses into the USB-C port, which the system thinks is just another TV or monitor. That means the best smart glasses for systems like the Steam Deck mainly revolve around your own needs rather than some complicated tech workaround.</p><p>I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal One Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> smart glasses for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally series, Lenovo Legion Go series, AYANEO 2S/3, MSI Claw, or most other handheld gaming systems. The Xreal One series is so good because it's the first set of smart display glasses with a custom chipset built in, which creates a fully tracked virtual screen in front of your face.</p><p>Here's what that means. When you plug most smart glasses into a Steam Deck, for instance, the screen that appears in front of your eyes follows your eyes at all times. If you move your head around, that screen never leaves your center of vision. While this is OK for sitting on the couch or lying in bed, it can be a little nauseating to some people in a moving vehicle.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fh64sAMLb3VwsWE7sKeSvC" name="viture-mobile-dock-nintendo-switch-adapter" alt="The Steam Deck adapter for the Viture One Mobile Dock and Viture Pro Mobile Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fh64sAMLb3VwsWE7sKeSvC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GHuFQBMqmQ7LBugJYfFnxC" name="viture-one-mobile-dock-steam-deck-back" alt="The Steam Deck adapter for the Viture One Mobile Dock and Viture Pro Mobile Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHuFQBMqmQ7LBugJYfFnxC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3byBWtMSLhUDE9bpvArJ" name="steam-deck-viture-one-glasses.jpg" alt="Using Viture One glasses with a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3byBWtMSLhUDE9bpvArJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With Xreal One, the virtual screen is pinned in 3D space, much like a TV is mounted to a wall. If you move your head around, the screen stays where it's supposed to, no matter where you're looking. If you prefer it to stay pinned to the center of your vision, a quick tap of the side button will cycle between display modes, so you can choose what works best for the situation you're in.</p><p>Xreal One also includes a bevy of additional calibration tools and options built into the glasses that can be toggled via the buttons on the underside of each arm. In every way you can imagine, they feel like a proper "monitor for your face," including all those extra options you find in a monitor's settings menu. Other smart glasses require separate hardware or software to do anything similar, and most don't offer the same options even with those extras.</p><p>The only reason I would recommend other glasses at this point in time is if you have a specific need. RayNeo Air 3S offers 3840Hz PWM dimming as an excellent eye care solution, so if Xreal Ones give you a headache, RayNeo Air 3S is likely the alternative you need. You can also use a Viture One Mobile Dock or Viture Pro Mobile Dock with the Steam Deck, which will allow you to play the system and charge at the same time. If you do this, I recommend grabbing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.viture.com/product/mobile-dock-mount-for-steam-deck">Steam Deck mount</a> for the dock.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-glasses-for-your-phone-tablet-or-computer"><span>Best smart glasses for your phone, tablet, or computer</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA" name="xreal-one-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a pair of Xreal One smart glasses while working on a laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sPSFaW7UBUS4RV2J7XWSeA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One and Xreal One Pro are still the best choice for these platforms since they provide a tracked screen that's best for plug-and-play. But it's worth noting that companies like Viture and RayNeo offer software suites on smart devices that deliver additional functionality over the normal plug-and-play experience. Xreal also has an app called Nebula, but I wouldn't recommend using it at all.</p><p>It's important to know about these because, even if your glasses don't offer native 3DoF window tracking like Xreal Ones do out of the box, an extra app can allow your computer, phone, or tablet to do all the computing needed to make that happen.</p><p>I wouldn't say most of this software is user-friendly — especially not on the PC/Mac side of things — but smartphone apps are much more straightforward.

Between the two, I would recommend SpaceWalker, as it not only has a lot more development time behind it, but the UI is more straightforward, and it supports <em>a lot</em> more platforms.</p><p>But if you're just looking for a simple plug-and-play experience, stick with Xreal One.</p><h2 id="even-more-smart-glasses-are-around-the-corner-2">Even more smart glasses are around the corner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smart glasses are booming right now, and the industry isn't slowing down anytime soon.

However, smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-and-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-built-for-athletes-and-they-look-insane" target="_blank">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> (pronounced "how-stuhn") have several additional factors to consider, including camera quality, battery life, charging speed, and more.</p><p>While Oakley Meta HSTN is a clear evolution over what made Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses so great, there's a clear price difference between the two models. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/level-up-your-tech-game-with-20-percent-off-these-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">gone on sale a lot recently</a>, with prices dipping down to around $240 for a pair. Meanwhile, Oakley Meta HSTN launches on July 11 for $399, while some style choices will cost you $499. That's a big price gap!</p><p>But are the Oakley glasses worth the cost? Designer brands are often more expensive just because of a name, but Oakley Meta HSTN does a good job of providing extra value for a higher price.

Oakley Meta HSTN only ships in four main colors, too: Black, Warm Grey, Clear, and Brown Smoke. With each of these frame colors, you can choose from six different lens colors: Warm Grey, Clear, Grey Transitions, Ruby, PRIZM Polar Deep Water, or PRISM Polar Black.</p><p>Based on this, you can guess that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are <em>the</em> choice for folks who want a range of styles and colors to select from. However, as I mentioned earlier, this choice isn't <em>just </em>about style. It's about function, too.</p><p>While Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses offer more style and color options, Oakley Meta HSTN are designed to be a sportier, more performance-focused pair of smart glasses. Meta even states this in the "How to choose" section of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/">AI Glasses product page</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YKyZFwoLkHfXYQ7yTA5UM9" name="oakley-meta-hstn-all-colors" alt="All available colors of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YKyZFwoLkHfXYQ7yTA5UM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">All available Oakley Meta HSTN colors and styles </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of which model, style, or color you choose, all Meta AI glasses ship with a single camera on one side of the front of the frame and a privacy LED on the opposite side. They also include over-the-ear speakers built into the glasses' arms, a battery that lasts several hours, and can be recharged via the included storage case.</p><p>That storage case works just like an earbud case works, so you'll charge the battery in the case by plugging a USB-C cable into its port. You'll then dock the glasses inside the carrying case any time they need a top-up, and the case's battery will give your glasses several full charges before needing to be topped up again.</p><p>Either way, when you buy a pair of Meta AI glasses, you're getting a pair of frames that look like glasses, not a tech gadget that just so happens to be on your face.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-cameras-and-battery-life-2">Oakley Meta HSTN glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: Cameras and battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PU27DsF3iLwKhPZjTMAVNf" name="oakley-meta-hstn-official-render-white-camera-01" alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PU27DsF3iLwKhPZjTMAVNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we don't know the battery size of Oakley Meta HSTN yet, we know that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses use a 154mAh battery.

Oakley Meta HSTN glasses weigh 53g, indicating that they have a larger battery than Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but certainly not double the capacity, unless Meta switched battery technology.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while both glasses feature just one 12MP camera on the front, Oakley Meta HSTN are able to record at 3K resolution while Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are restricted to 1080p.</p><p>That extra boost in video recording resolution is thanks mainly to a new camera sensor, which should also take higher quality photos, even if they're in the same resolution.

Oakley's trademark PRISM Polar lenses provide a unique look through the glasses when compared to Ray-Ban's offerings, but you'll pay at least $100 more for Oakley's enhanced capabilities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses offer a significant number of additional style choices over Oakley and are less expensive, to boot. There's no known software feature differentiation between Oakley and Ray-Ban, though, so you're mainly choosing between style, performance, and cost.</p><p>If I had to pick one to buy today, I'd still choose Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because of the style options and the value, but there's no denying that Oakley Meta HSTN are more capable glasses that help solve the biggest issue of all: battery life.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="76e79cd8-f9a6-4aa3-b82d-1d64e2b3a357">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, much better battery life, faster charging, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4be7e7a1-8b29-4a1f-9ea7-cc4981779e6c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPc8eyrKGnph3TrfkCWp8S.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses in Wayfarer style"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have been a staple of the industry for nearly two nears now, pushing glasses-based AI to new fronts and making photo and video capture easier than ever.

All of your available Gems (custom and pre-made) will appear within the Workspace side panel for supported apps.</p><p>Google states Gems can also understand Workspace's "@" function for finding files and more.</p><h2 id="gems-make-their-rounds-2">Gems make their rounds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:955px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.83%;"><img id="94vzcyTcsmR9UEpTVo9wW3" name="google-workspace-gems-update-rolling-out" alt="Google is rolling out Gems for users to create custom AI "experts" that can help them with specific tasks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/94vzcyTcsmR9UEpTVo9wW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="955" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15146780">a more in-depth explainer</a> for users who are just getting started with Gems to check out.</p><p>The update has started rolling out and should take roughly 15 days to complete for Workspace users on Rapid and Schedule domains.

Its uses are similar to how Gems work anywhere else (including the Gemini app).

Early on, Google highlighted a few pre-made options users would find, like a Career guide, Writing editor, and Coding partner Gem. Each of these can walk users through the process, elevating their writing with proper grammar/structure, or learning about their aspirations to find the right career for them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The leak features a trio of images, each showcasing different aspects of the phone straight out of its assumed packaging. The major change, which is what's got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/lakshyalark/status/1940740551537840164">everyone chatting on X</a>, is with the phone's cameras. The leak suggests the phone has dropped the black rings, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the Fold 6</a> featured, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Instead, it seems the phone will sport shimmering, silver rings around its camera lenses, which certainly gives it a bit of pop. The phone's cameras are still sitting atop an island, which makes its array stand out.</p><p>The cover and internal displays remain covered; however, the leaked imagery turns the device flat, showing off Samsung's continued thin era. While it's hard to get an exact estimation, it <em>seems </em>like the Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review#:~:text=SAMSUNG%20GALAXY%20Z%20FOLD%206%3A%20DESIGN%20AND%20DISPLAYS">much thinner than the Fold 6</a>. The phone's SIM tray takes up all the space available, in contrast to the bit of wiggle room it had on the Fold 6.</p><h2 id="the-fold-is-coming-2">The Fold is Coming</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Fold 7 pic.twitter.com/h8EhC7LbTP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1940641079948378581">July 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 allegedly leaked back in June <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-leak-ahead-of-rumored-launch">in some renders</a>. As we've been hearing for a while, Samsung seems to have inched toward a much thinner, sleeker Fold 7 compared to its previous editions. The latest rumors claim the device is roughly 215 grams, around 24 grams lighter than the Fold 6. Even when closed in the renders, the device <em>appears </em>thinner than before.</p><p>Just how thin isn't confirmed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-might-be-gunning-for-the-crown-as-the-worlds-thinnest-foldable">but rumors say</a> the Fold 7 could measure 8.9mm when folded. When opened, this could come out to 3.9mm. Other whispers claim the phone won't see a battery upgrade, as it might still rock a 4,400mAh battery setup.</p><p>Another aspect we've kept our eyes on is pricing. Considering the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">changes to tariffs</a>, it may leave some potential Samsung consumers concerned over the next Fold, but there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-wont-see-a-price-hike">might be some good news</a>. Some rumors state Samsung might launch the Fold 7 at around $1,899, which is similar to its 2024 model. The Flip 7 might also stick around the same area at $1,099. These prices regard "most markets," but the U.S. could be stuck with a major 30-40% increase.</p><p>We won't have to remain in speculation for much longer, as Samsung is gearing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-july-unpacked">Unpacked on July 9</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
