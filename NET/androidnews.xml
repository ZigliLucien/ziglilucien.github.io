While the update adds a number of features to the new flagship lineup, including auto-themed icons and AI-powered notification summaries, it also seems to have killed support for the Pixel Stand wireless charger.</p><p>Google debuted the Pixel 10 series as the first flagship Android phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 wireless charging support</a>. Alongside native Qi2 charging, Google also launched its own lineup of Qi2 accessories called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which includes a new wireless charger and stand designed for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Naturally, Google ended support for the older Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) for the Pixel 10, considering the company needed to push its new wireless chargers and the fact that the second-gen Pixel Stand topped out at 7.5W, leading to slow charging speeds and overheating, while the new Pixelsnap chargers deliver up to 25W.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-update-quietly-breaks-pixel-stand-support-2">Pixel 10 update quietly breaks Pixel Stand support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-XL-pixelsnap-charger-02" alt="Qi2 25W charging using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, many users found that at the perfect angle, the Pixel Stand still worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. But now, users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pe68ty/pixel_stand_gen_2_not_working_after_update/">Reddit</a> are reporting that after the Android 16 QPR2 update, the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works with their devices.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/08/pixel-stand-charging-broken-for-pixel-10-10-pro-after-december-update/">PiunikaWeb</a>, users say that after the update, the Pixel Stand flashes orange and white whenever a Pixel 10 is placed on it. This wasn't the case earlier, but the charger now reportedly throws an error when attempting to charge. This means that Google has intentionally broken support for Pixel Stand in the latest Android update.</p><p>It's worth noting that the issue is limited to Pixel 10 series devices, and Google has always stated that the Pixel Stand doesn't officially support the Pixel 10. It worked until now, but the latest update seems to have introduced a change that breaks compatibility.</p><p>If you're looking for a new wireless charger, you might want to pick up one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">new Qi2 wireless chargers</a> to make sure your device charges at maximum speed without any issues.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the study, the earlier a kid owns a smartphone, the greater the risk they have of adverse effects on their sleep, emotional state, and health.</p><p>We had several options, ranging from ages 5-7 to age 14 and older. Somewhat surprisingly, of the hundreds of responses we received, most were from older ages. In fact, <strong>ages 14 and up</strong> was the most popular response with 53% of the votes, followed by ages 11-13 with 36% of the votes, ages 8-10 with 10% of the votes, and ages 5-7 with the remaining votes.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-WlkAve"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/WlkAve.js" async></script><p>Enjoy our content?

This would fall somewhere in the 10 to 14 age range, and is considered, to many, an important time for kids, socially. With the advent of after-school programs, social activities, and a growing need for independence as they navigate their pre-teen years, having an easier way to contact your child and keep track of their whereabouts may become a necessity for some parents.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think 13/14 is a good age for kids knowing how to act online and 16 for all other cases<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996827061319880945">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We gave our granddaughter one when she stated middle school.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1997734976037806385">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>However, some were not as open to smartphone use for younger children, especially as the cost of owning one continues to go up and phones become more expensive.

Initially, it didn't work — ChatGPT had better models, more use cases, and superior brand power.</p><p>Over the past year, there's been a strong sense that the tide is turning. Gemini is the only AI chatbot to consistently gain web traffic share over the past 12 months, chipping away at ChatGPT's major lead (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Similarweb/status/1988879389992386897" target="_blank">SimilarWeb on X</a>). On top of that, Gemini 3 is here, and it's been so well-received by users that Google is taking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-antigravitys-rate-limits-are-changing-amid-incredible-demand">creative steps to meet the outstanding demand</a>.</p><p>I'm bullish on Google's ability to outrun competitors like OpenAI, and frankly, it has little to do with Gemini 3's benchmarks or how well <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-the-heck-is-gemini-nano-banana">Nano Banana</a> can generate images. Those factors are only a small part of what makes an AI suite successful. Instead, I'm getting the sense that Google finally <em>gets it</em>.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Google showed that it can consistently build great models, wrap them in engaging apps, and create catchy brands for its AI models. As a result, I'm a believer.</p><h2 id="gemini-3-shows-google-can-stay-at-the-top-2">Gemini 3 shows Google can stay at the top</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YbEALjJaoaob9xBzSm3yzb" name="Gemini-3-3" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbEALjJaoaob9xBzSm3yzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If we've learned anything over the years, it's that building one great AI model isn't enough for sustained success.

Sure enough, Gemini 2.5 Pro was eventually unseated by models from xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI. That's why Gemini 3 Pro's return to the top of the chart after Gemini 2.5 Pro was dethroned is a good sign of Google's consistency.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ" name="gemini_3_lm_arena_leaderboard (1)" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R" name="gemini_3_webdev_arena_leaderboard" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN" name="Gemini-3-Deep-Think-benchmarks.jpg" alt="Gemini 3 Deep Think benchmark graphs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini 3 Pro remains the top-ranked text model on the LMArena leaderboard.

It's not the best at playing games, nor does it have the greatest display you've ever seen.

The battery charges nicely and quickly, and once full, expect it to be there for you all day long. This one is a battery life champ!</p><p><strong>Ultra-portable</strong>.

You would expect a Chromebook designed to be light and easy on the battery to have a small display, but the IdeaPad Slim has a 14-inch FHD display.

It's capable, but just. You can do anything a Chromebook is capable of doing with 4GB of memory, but you can't do too many things at once. Watching a video or playing an Android game is no problem, but don't do both for the best experience.</p><p><strong>It has 64GB of storage</strong>. That's not too bad, but it might be limited depending on what you're looking for. The real issue is that you can never change out the embedded storage to add more</p><p><strong>It's already two years old. </strong>Like your phone, there is a limited support lifetime for Chromebooks. This version of the IdeaPad Slim should be supported by Google officially until 2032, so there is still plenty of life left in it.</p><p><strong>The trackpad and keyboard aren't going to amaze you. </strong>They're more than adequate, but with this one being perfect for things like online school work or for a student to carry to class, you'll be spending a lot of time using the trackpad and keyboard. They could be better and more responsive.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So should you buy the IdeaPad Slim 3?</p><p>Ask yourself do you want or need something easy to carry with long battery life for getting any sort of work done? Or do you need something cheap yet capable for homework and business away from your desk?</p><p>If you said yes to either of these, this is perfect for you. It's not the Chromebook for the showcase, but it is a workhorse that will last you all day.

Google denies such claims.</p><p>This afternoon, Marvin posted on Google's official Ads Liaison X account, stating that, "In short, there are no ads in the Gemini app, and there are no current plans to change that." Marvin reiterates the company's work to place ads in AI Overviews, a feature that is meant to be "helpful" to users, as it should only display products "relevant" to your query. The social media post states that U.S. users have this available in AI Overviews; however, there are plans to expand this to more (English-speaking) regions.</p><p>The original story can be read below.</p><p>A recent development in the AI chatbot space reports that Google is preparing to slip even more ads into an app that Android users may lean on.</p><p>Word broke on X via a post by Walter Bloomberg (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1998077960964768244">DeItaone</a>), which states that Google is seeking to bring ads to its AI chatbot, Gemini. The social media post states that the company has "told advertisers" that it will bring ads to Gemini in 2026. What's unclear here is whether or not these ads would appear on the mobile app alongside the web app, though it's hard to imagine one without the other.</p><p>More importantly, the report doesn't state in what capacity users could see ads appear in Gemini next year.</p><p>The Gemini app is currently quite clean, offering an easy-to-use chatting space with the AI, as well as a sidebar with additional options on the left. There's a chance ads could appear within chats themselves, potentially as a footnote, or in that sidebar for more "creative" ad space. Aside from the theories, the X post adds that this report was the result of "agency buyers familiar with the conversations," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/">Ad Week</a> (paywalled), which published the exclusive.</p><p>The publication adds that, in a few calls with advertisers, Google has expressed its intent to roll out "ad placements" in Gemini next year. Supposedly, this new venture for Google for ads in Gemini is separate from what it's trying to do with AI Mode, though the details are still being hashed out.</p><h2 id="entering-another-new-era-2">Entering (another) new era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google and ads seem like familiar territory for many users, especially those targeted by their recent searches. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">announced that it would bring ads</a> to its bite-sized search results, AI Overviews, in 2024. During that time, Google said that it would only display ads if they were "relevant" to what the user had searched. If you're looking to compare cleaning products, it's likely you'll see ads for those same brands the AI compared for you.</p><p>We're entering an interesting juncture, as Google, at the time, stated that ads in AI Overviews were "helpful." This was a statement facilitated by user studies and tests where the company offered ads depending on the search and AI results. Perhaps these ads are more "helpful" or "accepted" in a web or search form, but to see them in Gemini, a chatbot and chatting space, might be a different story.</p><p>Regardless, this is seemingly the future we're staring at.</p><p>This report, highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, comes a few days after rumors claimed that OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/signs-in-chatgpts-code-suggest-android-users-are-in-for-an-influx-of-ads">was looking at rolling out ads in ChatGPT</a>. This would affect its mobile app experience, and it seems that ChatGPT could show ads based on its "memory," essentially, what it remembers about the user through their ads and frequent asks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At first glance, the proposed renderings claim that next year's stylus will look similar to Motorola's design from 2025, as well as a few of its other phones this year. The phone's rear panel hosts a square (rounded corner) camera array in the top left corner. Its corners, around its frame, remain quite soft, rounded for better in-hand comfort.</p><p>Supposedly, Motorola is interested in equipping the phone with an "eco-leather" material on its back panel, rather than glass. This material rolls over that camera housing for a seamless aesthetic.</p><p>The publication adds that the G Stylus 2026 could feature a triple camera setup, though the specifics of those lenses are unknown. When it comes to potential upgrades, the rumors allege that it could see a battery slightly over 5,000mAh. We can stay hopeful with this, but it's worth noting that the G Stylus has kept the same 5,000mAh battery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">for the past two iterations</a>. Charging strength is expected to remain the same as its 2025 iteration, much like its RAM/storage.</p><p>As far as colors go, the Moto G Stylus 2026 is allegedly keeping the same colorful back plus frame design. The leaked renders show off the phone in a supposed Lavender and black option, both of which see that same color applied to its side rails. The leak dipped into its potential power, which suggests a mid-range Qualcomm chip could get the gig. If true, then we might see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">Snapdragon 6 Gen 4</a> applied to next year's G Stylus, as well as a 6.7-inch display, but things are still early.</p><h2 id="the-return-of-the-stylus-2">The Return of the Stylus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:934px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.24%;"><img id="wGL3py6TqaLJxp2KDievU6" name="moto-g-stylus-2026-leaked-rendering" alt="An alleged rendering of the Moto G Stylus 2026, where one model is in Lavender, while the other is in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGL3py6TqaLJxp2KDievU6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="934" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola recently expanded its mid-range line late this year, in November, as it launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-2026-and-moto-g-play-2026-launch">the G 2026 and G Play 2026</a>. The former debuted with a 50MP camera and 30W charging strength. The G Play took things down a little further, opting for a 32MP camera array and a 5,200mAh battery. Each device was equipped with the MediaTek 6300, a mid-range chip that offers pretty decent capabilities, good enough for daily tasks.</p><p>They'll likely struggle a little with the FPS in more intense mobile games, but they can get the job done in other areas. This is where Moto's G Stylus usually takes things up a little, at least, chip-wise. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">2025 version</a> included the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which was good at running games, but, as previously stated, mid-range chips often falter slightly with more graphically intense games.</p><p>The Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 was announced earlier this year, and Qualcomm said the chip was upgraded with an 11% faster CPU and 29% better graphics. <em>If </em>Motorola is looking at this chip for its next Stylus, maybe it'll hold its own a little better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One area where Samsung is particularly lacking is portable chargers. The brand doesn't have a first-party magnetic power bank available yet, and that makes topping up ultra-thin phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge tricky. If you recall, Apple basically marketed the new MagSafe Battery as an essential accessory for the slim iPhone Air.</p><p>That looks to be changing, as a new Samsung magnetic power bank has appeared on the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi2 database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/08/samsungs-qi2-magnet-wireless-battery-pack-leaks-fixes-a-galaxy-phone-problem/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's called the "Magnet Wireless Battery Pack," and has a certification date of Dec. 5, 2025. The power bank uses the magnetic power profile (MPP), according to the database listing, which means it features magnets for snap connection with Qi2 devices and cases.</p><p>Samsung's Magnet Wireless Power Bank supports Qi2.1, and it'll max out at 15W charging speeds as a result. It doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2 25W</a>, so it can't deliver 25W speeds to supported devices. However, this is unlikely to become an issue, as most chargers and accessories cannot sustain wireless 25W power delivery for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The Magnet Wireless Power Bank has a Samsung model number of <strong>EB-U2500</strong>, per the listing. This follows a separate leak that revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-qi2-charger-leak-suggests-a-magsafe-rival-could-finally-come-to-the-galaxy-s26" target="_blank">Samsung Qi2 magnetic charging dock </a>last week.</p><p>All together, it looks like Samsung will indeed add embedded Qi2 magnets directly inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. The current Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">require a compatible case</a> to unlock full magnetic Qi2 support.</p><h2 id="addressing-a-unique-galaxy-design-flaw-2">Addressing a unique Galaxy design flaw</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one interesting bit about the Samsung Magnet Wireless Battery Pack — the design. It mostly features a rectangular shape, from the one render available on the WPC database. However, there are clearly cutouts on the corners that curve around the Qi2 magnetic ring. This makes for an odd visual design, but it's there for a reason.</p><p>Samsung's rear camera lens arrangement can interfere with Qi2 charging accessories. While Apple and Google phones have more compact camera arrangements near the top of the devices, Samsung's single-lens arrangements protrude deeper into the body of the phone. This can prevent Qi2 chargers from sitting flush. It certainly looks like the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack is designed to address this compatibility issue once and for all.</p><p>Samsung hasn't confirmed the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack on its side of things yet. We could see it debut alongside the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, we spotted this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank"><strong>40% off discount on the Fitbit Versa 4 at Amazon</strong></a>, bringing it down to just $120.</p><p>The Versa 4 is our top pick for mid-range Fitbit options, despite Google recently pushing more of its advanced features toward the Pixel series. Regardless, the Versa 4 will still get users GPS, a 24-hour heart rate monitoring system, and a variety of exercise modes to choose from. It's also a bit smaller than most smartwatches, which makes it a worthy option for sleep monitoring when compared to the many bulkier options available.</p><p>The Versa 4 also includes access to apps like Fitbit Pay, Amazon's Alexa, Google Wallet and Maps, as well as offering daily stress management and readiness features. It also sports a long-lasting battery, 50-meter water resistance, and additional health metrics such as menstrual health tracking, guided breathing sessions, mindfulness programs, and still more. At the time of writing, this deal is available for the Black, Pink Sand, and Waterfall Blue versions of the smartwatch.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU" name="Fitbit Versa 4" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Fitbit Versa 4:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$199.95</del> <strong>$119.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Fitbit Versa 4 is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit#section-best-midrange">best mid-range Fitbit</a>, though the current $120 price tag makes it even more appealing amongst some of its competitors.

However, that only tells part of the story. Apple earned the top four spots, and four of its five best-selling smartphones were "premium" models. Meanwhile, Samsung didn't have a single premium handset on the top charts, instead earning its five places on the best-selling list with midrange Galaxy A models.</p><p>The best-selling smartphone in Q3 2025 was the base-model iPhone 16, by a wide margin. It had a 4% volume share, and this helped the iPhone 16 keep its first-place spot for the third consecutive quarter. Surprisingly, the top four spots were held by the iPhone 16 series — the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and iPhone 16e, in that order — which usually experiences a seasonal sales decline before new models come out.</p><p>Another surprise was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, which earned the 10th-place spot despite going on sale at the tail end of the Q3 2025 tracking period. This suggests there is strong demand for the iPhone 17 series, and specifically, the most-expensive iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.05%;"><img id="jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh" name="Q3-2025-Counterpoint-Research-Sales" alt="The Counterpoint Research smartphone sales data for Q3 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2404" height="1083" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint Research)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's bread and butter in Q3 2025 was the midrange market. It held the fifth-place through ninth-place spots with its latest Galaxy A-series phones. The best-seller of the bunch was the Galaxy A16 5G, followed by the Galaxy A06, Galaxy A36, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56</a>, and Galaxy A16 4G. Samsung didn't have a single premium smartphone on the list. Last year, Samsung had the base-model Galaxy S24 on the Q3 2024 best-sellers list.</p><p>Counterpoint Research thinks Samsung's addition of AI features to the Galaxy A series via "Awesome Intelligence" could be driving sales.</p><p>"The mid-price segment’s presence in the top-10 best-selling smartphones is expected to remain strong, driven by the growing integration of GenAI features," the report explains. "These advancements make the segment more competitive, deliver greater value to consumers, and further bridge the user experience with flagship models."</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 could be experiencing an early seasonal decline as buyers look ahead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>. However, its absence from the list is a big deal for Samsung. With only the Galaxy A-series appearing on the best-sellers list, Samsung doesn't have a single phone with a wholesale price of over $600 here.</p><p>Additionally, 5G phones covered all of the top five spots for the first time, with Counterpoint Research calling the technology "a key consumer preference across regions" as of Q3 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During the show, Google offered a glimpse into the progress it has made with its Android XR smartglasses, and also announced some new capabilities coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Samsung's Galaxy XR</a> headset starting today(Dec. 8).</p><p>Starting off with Galaxy XR's new tricks, which Google says are designed to "help you fully experience the spatial capabilities of Android XR and allow you to fit your headset naturally into the things you do every day."</p><p>With the Galaxy XR's new "PC Connect" ability, users will be able to expand their workspace beyond the desktop to the headset, then pull in their desktop or a window from their computer and place it side-by-side with native apps from Google Play. This feature is super cool for when you need a multi-screen view to get things done, or if you'd like a more spatial view of the game you've been playing on the PC.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9xPC_FoaG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Next up, Google is introducing "Travel mode," which is designed to transform any small area, such as a flight cabin, into an immersive workspace or personal home theater when you're stuck in the same space for several hours, allowing you to stay connected while on the go.</p><p>Speaking of work, the tech giant is also bringing "Likeness," a feature that will create a" realistic digital representation of your face that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time." This means that even though you're wearing the Galaxy XR headset, others will be able to see your reactions and expressions in real-time, making interactions feel more natural.</p><p>All of these features for the Galaxy XR Headset are currently in the Beta phase, and users can head to the Help center to get more information on how to try these tricks out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="project-aura-by-xreal-2">Project Aura by XReal</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh" name="Aura_3_TAS_XR_ Nov 06 2025_110 (1)" alt="Google shows off Project Aura XReal glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5871" height="3914" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is giving us the first look at Project Aura from XREAL, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. These glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.  For instance, giving you a "floating recipe video while you cook or seeing step-by-step visual guides anchored to an appliance you are fixing," all this without blocking off your surroundings. Ofcourse, all with the help of Gemini.</p><p>That said, these XReal smartglasses come wired and are synced to a phone-sized device with a trackpad that handles the computing, according to Android Central's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">who was able to demo these glasses</a>. Google states that the glasses are set to launch sometime next year.</p><p>However, it is important to note that these XReal prototypes aren't the design that Samsung will use; Hicks says it'll be using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">Warby Parker and Gentle Monster </a>designs, which will be compatible with both Android and iOS, and that they will be wireless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, in a press release to Android Central, Google says it is currently working on two pairs of glasses. One being the screen-free AI glasses, which have in-built speakers, microphones, and cameras to allow you to talk to Gemini, take photos, and get help. The second, display AI glasses, which add a small screen to show private, helpful information when you need it, such as navigation or translation. The former is set to arrive next year.</p><p>Google is also releasing Developer Preview 3, giving developers to build new experiences for AI glasses and wired XR glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This time, I used these single-HUD glasses for over 30 minutes, testing Gemini, Google Maps and Translate, YouTube Music, Uber, and other glasses-based apps.</p><p>Next, Google had me try a new binocular glasses prototype — meaning they use dual displays with a wider FoV and 3D depth capabilities. Then I tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">XREAL Project Aura</a>, photographed above, which uses the same UI and pinch gestures as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a> but with a lighter form factor and 70-degree FoV.</p><h2 id="what-to-expect-from-android-xr-glasses-2">What to expect from Android XR glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7547px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZMnVe2ZdCf8TYieDQSfoKZ" name="XREAL-Project-Aura-close-up" alt="A photo of the XREAL Project Aura glasses sitting on a plastic pedestal, with dark lenses and a cord connected to a computing device with trackpad." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMnVe2ZdCf8TYieDQSfoKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7547" height="4245" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">XREAL Project Aura </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XREAL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's monocular prototype and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> software will serve as the foundation for Samsung's glasses hardware, which will launch next year with designs from Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. They'll also launch "screen-free" AI glasses in 2026, relying on speakers, mics, cameras, and Gemini smarts for an audio-led experience. They'll be a serious competitor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses</a>.</p><p>The two-display version, by contrast, won't arrive until 2027 at the earliest. Juston Payne, Android XR's senior product director, explained that they still "weigh a little bit too much" for consumers, so Google will "wait until it's ready." I certainly felt the pinch on my nose, about on par with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3-OJxxW810" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The audio-only glasses will probably be the most affordable, thin, and popular. Payne said that Android XR pulls from years of audio-only tools created for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a> and Pixel accessibility tools like TalkBack, "leveraging what was already there."</p><p>I turned off the glasses HUD with a button tap and could still rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> smarts that I'd normally get on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>. Payne says he expects that "much of the usage" of these HUD glasses will be "with the display off," so using an audio-only version "isn't like a painful cut," Payne reassured me.</p><p>I didn't get a chance to photograph the prototypes, but the final versions won't look the same, anyway. What matters more is what I learned, both during the demo and behind the scenes, about what to expect from these new Samsung-made, Google-powered glasses, including how they'll sync with other Google devices and take advantage of Pixel camera expertise.</p><h2 id="these-smart-glasses-will-work-with-ios-but-the-android-integration-is-key-2">These smart glasses will work with iOS, but the Android integration is key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During my glasses prototype demo, they surprised me with the news that the eventual Samsung release will work on both Android and iOS. I assumed they'd make the same mistake as with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and make it Android-exclusive, but Google's team stressed that iPhone owners will want these enhanced Google app experiences, too.</p><p>Most of the features I demoed on Google's AI glasses — image recognition and recipe advice via cameras, automatic live translation, shared camera view during calls, local restaurant recs, turn-by-turn navigation with a minimap, or beamforming to differentiate between my voice and others — are also available on Meta's AI or HUD glasses.</p><p>Meta achieved this by combining its own apps and smarts with major partners, enabling its AI commands to trigger basic tools such as starting a playlist or calling a contact. While Google has direct Android system access, it clearly realized it can deliver a similar piecemeal experience on iPhones and <em>vastly</em> expand its potential audience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cS9xg3YcAESQgZGJfhDeNY" name="Android-XR-maps" alt="A video still of a person using Android XR glasses to ask for a nearby coffeeshop and receive directions in Maps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cS9xg3YcAESQgZGJfhDeNY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2025" height="1139" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the Android experience should be the definitive one, with direct access to all Play Store apps instead of specific access to the Google Workspace suite and Gemini, plus partner apps. And they'll sync with other Android accessories.</p><p>When I took a photo with the glasses, a preview appeared on a Google rep's Pixel Watch. He said that other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, like Galaxy Watches, will integrate with Android XR so that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-watches-are-sidekick-gemini-needs-for-android-xr-to-work">gestures trigger certain actions</a> — similar to how Meta uses its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG band</a> for gesture controls.</p><p>Plus, on Android, the developer tools built for phones will carry over to the glasses. For example, if an app supports Live Update notifications, devs won't have to "do anything else" for glasses to show the same rich notifications, Payne says.</p><p>It's up to developers to decide whether to take advantage of the Android XR SDK and APIs to do more. Uber, for example, was "excited" by the Google Maps demo this May and decided to create a similar experience. During my demo, Google simulated a pick-up event; I could see an airport map to the pick-up zone by looking down, with a normal widget of my driver's details when looking ahead.</p><h2 id="the-main-challenges-that-google-had-to-solve-2">The main challenges that Google had to solve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV" name="gentle-monster-warby-parker-partnerships-android-xr" alt="Android XR partners Gentle Monster and Warby Parker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1591" height="895" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't know what the Warby Parker and Gentle Monster designs will look like, but Payne promises that these Samsung Glasses will be "eyewear first," with both prescriptions and "sun tints" available, as well as "stylistic variety" so anyone can find a pair that matches their "preferences."</p><p>But their primary strategy to keep these glasses comfortable and stylish, according to Payne, is to "offload" as much computation as possible to the phone, enabling smaller batteries and thinner frames.</p><p>That's why they're not selling the two-display glasses in 2026; while they're "nowhere near as heavy as 70 or 80 grams," they're still above the "comfort threshold" that consumers will accept. But Payne seems to think they'll solve this hardware issue soon. It'll be exciting when they do, as weight aside, this prototype was more pleasurable to use, with a wider, centered field and depth added to certain apps — like 3D buildings in Google Maps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vv6mm2zR2gAxAWtyt5ENg" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-06" alt="Pixel 10 with a blue Pixelsnap case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vv6mm2zR2gAxAWtyt5ENg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another smart glasses challenge that Google and Samsung will have to solve is camera quality. Meta glasses can capture <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review" target="_blank">high-resolution photos</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearing-the-oakley-meta-hstn-smart-ai-glasses-during-spartan-race" target="_blank">stabilize videos</a>, but they have limitations, especially in low-light photography, framing, and zoom.</p><p>Payne says Samsung is responsible for the cameras in the eventual consumer release, but it's a "tight partnership" with Google handling the post-processing and AI image-editing side of things. So I asked Payne what to expect.</p><p>Payne acknowledged readily that "physics will get in the way" of giving these glasses the same camera quality as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, because frames can't fit large sensors, but he's confident that Google's "computational photography investments" will help the glasses "push up to that level of quality." I also assume that tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> will help you remove the excess details around your subject.</p><p>On that note, when I told Payne that my current AI glasses don't always know which object in front of me I'm asking about, he promised that Gemini is good at "inferring" the subject, but suggested people can "point at" or hold something, and Gemini will use that context when answering.</p><h2 id="xreal-project-aura-matters-as-much-as-galaxy-xr-for-android-xr-s-future-2">XREAL Project Aura matters as much as Galaxy XR for Android XR's future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi" name="project-aura-tease" alt="Project Aura glasses teased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2233" height="1256" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite a decade of Google Glass, VR headsets, and AR prototypes, Payne says that it's still "early days for XR overall," with 2026 as a "big year" because the upcoming AI and HUD glasses will be the first smart glasses with an "app ecosystem."</p><p>But if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is to become the 'next large computing platform,' it can't just be the Samsung & Google show. Google will need it to be a proper open system, with more partners. And that starts with XREAL Project Aura becoming a success story.</p><p>When I tested XREAL Project Aura, it had the same onboarding experience as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-can-live-up-to-its-price-tag">Galaxy XR</a>, with an identical pinching tutorial and the same apps and Gemini integration. The performance was seamless, the FoV was much wider than on other smart glasses, and it still has the upside of syncing with a Switch or Steam Deck for gaming.</p><p>These glasses certainly have the potential to find an audience, but what happens <em>after</em> launch? Will Project Aura receive Android support and software updates at the same cadence as Galaxy XR? Or will it lag behind as Google prioritizes its biggest partner? We've seen this in recent years with Wear OS, as long-term partners like Fossil and Mobvoi have fallen behind and given up on smartwatches.</p><p>Hopefully, Android XR sticks to a more collaborative and supportive path, growing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> category even further.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the rumor, Xiaomi could debut this Ultra device right after Christmas, on December 26. This debut could bring two varying RAM/storage variants, which, as the publication notes, mirrors what Xiaomi has done previously.</p><p>If we're going by that theory, the 17 Ultra could feature a 12/256GB and a 16/1TB variant for roughly 6,499 yuan (~$919) and 7,799 yuan (~$1,103), respectively.</p><p>Interestingly, the tipster's rumors continue, claiming that this alleged December 26 debut date could be preceded by a brief pre-order period. Xiaomi could begin this pre-order stage around December 15 through December 25. Typically, OEMs debut and begin their pre-order periods simultaneously, so perhaps we're looking at a December 15 (or rather a December 14 in the U.S.) announcement date from Xiaomi.</p><p>Of course, this is speculation, so take these rumors with a grain of salt for now.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-picture-2">An "Ultra" picture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3foQVbAMmjwSJNNWRwQED7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3foQVbAMmjwSJNNWRwQED7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier rumors about the Xiaomi 17 Ultra started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">shortly after the 17 series</a> originally debuted. Those Ultra theories alleged that the Chinese OEM was preparing a sharp difference for it, by granting it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-rumored-17-ultra-may-support-satellite-connectivity-over-the-latest-trio">satellite connectivity capabilities</a>. Those rumors, after spotting it passing through a Chinese database, suggest the phone will offer Tiantong-1 and Beidou technology. Multiple Chinese OEMs have used this tech before, likely indicating the 17 Ultra will see text and call support.</p><p>Rumors add that the device's satellite connectivity was only spotted for its Chinese variant, potentially leaving out any global users if it reaches more regions.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/these-xiaomi-17-ultra-leaks-predict-a-major-photography-upgrade-is-on-the-way">rumor to sink our teeth into</a> concerned the phone's photographic capabilities. Reports at the top of December purported that the 17 Ultra could feature Leica-branded lenses and hardware upgrades to reduce chromatic aberration, as well as reflections.</p><p>Four lenses could pack its rear panel, consisting of a 200MP lens alongside three 50MP lenses. Up until now, talks have claimed Xiaomi was aiming for a 2026 release of the 17 Ultra. Things have reportedly shifted now that we're further into December, but Xiaomi has yet to confirm anything itself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One such case, filed by the attorneys general in all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, accused Google of monopolizing app distribution and in-app billing methods.</p><p>Google settled the case in 2023 and denied any wrongdoing, but now, there's new information about when settlement payments will go out to users — and how much they'll get. The official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googleplaystateagantitrustlitigation.com" target="_blank">settlement website</a> confirms that payments from the $700 million fund will go out automatically to affected users via PayPal or Venmo.</p><p>You're eligible to receive money from the settlement if you bought an app from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a>, or made an in-app purchase using Google Play Billing, between Aug. 16, 2016 and Sept. 30, 2023. Users need to have an account located in a U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands to be a part of the settlement. That's quite a large scope, and most Google Play Store users active during that timeframe will likely be eligible for settlement payments.</p><p>According to settlement documents, the minimum settlement payments will be at least $2 each (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-play-settlement-payout/" target="_blank">ZDNet</a>). You could receive a higher amount depending on how much you spent on the Google Play Store between 2016 and 2023. Crucially, most payments will go out automatically. There's no need to file a claim or take any action — you'll get an email or text with the address or number associated with your Google Play account when the payments are ready.</p><h2 id="when-will-affected-play-store-users-get-their-cash-2">When will affected Play Store users get their cash?</h2><p>The settlement details also outline when you'll start receiving money. There are a few key dates to remember: Feb. 19, 2026 is the exclusion and objection deadline, while April 30, 2026 is the fairness hearing. You may want to exclude yourself or object to the settlement if you want to forfeit your settlement and keep your right to sue Google over these claims individually.</p><p>The fairness hearing is where a judge will consider whether to approve the settlement. If approved, the payments would begin going out automatically shortly after the hearing on April 30, 2026. So, in about five months, you might get a few bucks from this Google Play Store settlement in your PayPal or Venmo account.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This year has been full of notable releases for Honor, delivering fantastic options for the upper mid-range and premium segments. But the Honor Magic 7 Lite, which debuted at the very beginning of the year, but the ancient processor held it back in too many ways.</p><p>That's where the Honor Magic 8 Lite comes in. It upgrades to the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 tech, granting snappy performance to nearly everything on the phone. It retains the 108MP camera system from the Magic 7 Lite, which isn't nearly as good as the numbers suggest, but Honor's bevy of AI tricks, both in the camera software and the OS, help make up for what the hardware might lack.</p><p>And while the design of most of the phone feels extraordinarily mid-tier with an all-plastic construction, the Magic 8 Lite fits the "don't judge a book by its cover" idiom perfectly. That build is the toughest thing you'll see in almost any smartphone to date, including class-leading drop and ingress protection, an absolutely enormous battery, and six years of promised software updates in Europe to back that up. It's an impressive new entry that's worth taking a look at, for sure.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: Price, availability, and specs</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F46cgADMHzekjVnw9kF32P" name="honor-magic-8-lite-unboxing" alt="Unboxing the Honor Magic 8 Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F46cgADMHzekjVnw9kF32P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite is available in Europe and most countries where Honor phones are sold globally.

That's not to say the rest of the phone is bad, but these four areas are really what set this phone apart from the pack at this price.</p><p>While you might never imagine it from the all-plastic construction, this phone is as durable as it gets before entering the typically awful "rugged phone" category. It's got IP68 and IP69K ingress protection, plus a drop rating at up to 2.5m (8.2ft) on most hard surfaces, including cobblestone, marble, asphalt, and more.</p><p>It's also the perfect phone for people who find themselves using their phones while wet. Whether this means your fingers are wet while cooking, trying to use the phone in the rain (or shower), or just want to peruse TikTok while in a hot tub and never want to worry about dropping it in the water, things don't get better than this. Being able to actually use the screen while it's wet is something only flagships from Honor and OnePlus have been blessed with until now.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J9jeGZncZVYJZTNTJLJEUd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-07" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9jeGZncZVYJZTNTJLJEUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WB7pzJCnDunKcH6DbFbGUd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-06" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WB7pzJCnDunKcH6DbFbGUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UEv3Uyj5aRKGDW3FgEqLTd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-05" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UEv3Uyj5aRKGDW3FgEqLTd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6NpZYup6iMnU9XSattvGVd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-08" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6NpZYup6iMnU9XSattvGVd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While the chasis is irritatingly flat all around the sides — a trend I detest because of how difficult it is to pick up from a table and generally uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time — the camera island has a great unique style that's immediately identifiable. The stereo speaker system onboard is crisp, clean, and clear, with a maximum volume mode that's nothing short of impressive.</p><p>Battery life is beyond incredible, owing to a combination of a power-efficient processor paired with a 7500mAh battery. You'll easily get 2-3 days out of a charge no matter how you use the phone. Thankfully, unlike the Magic 7 Lite, the Magic 8 Lite has great everyday performance that matches the best competition in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eavs4hrz8potKpWkGznozJ" name="honor-magic-8-lite-pwm-measurement-all" alt="PWM charts and photos at 1/6400 shutter speed of the Honor Magic 8 Lite's dimming methods, including PWM dimming at low brightness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eavs4hrz8potKpWkGznozJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is also excellent, sporting a 120Hz OLED that's perfectly viewable in sunlight with flagship brightness levels.

From most angles, it seems like this is a perfect display for flicker-sensitive people, but it's got one big problem: dithering.</p><p>That's because while Honor says this display is capable of 10-bit color, it's actually an 8-bit display that uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to fake the additional 2-bit depth. That means anyone sensitive to flickering could find this display uncomfortable, which clearly clashes with Honor's claim that this is a "risk-free" display. At the least, this is still a much better display for flicker-sensitive folks than something from Samsung or Google in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yNjgdX6PDMFVakHZd36RvB" name="honor-magic-8-lite-09" alt="The home screen of the Honor Magic 8 Lite running Magic OS 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNjgdX6PDMFVakHZd36RvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor is launching this one with Magic OS 9, which is based on Android 15. That doesn't make much sense given the Magic 8 Pro launches with Magic OS 10 (based on Android 16) but, at the very least, European customers can expect to see the Magic OS 10 update land in April 2026.</p><p>Beyond that, expect five more years of OS and security updates if you live in Europe. It's a fantastic pledge that's only outdone by Samsung and Google by one year. I don't much care about the difference between six or seven years of updates, though, because, by that point, a mid-range phone will likely be sluggish and nearly unusable.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: What could use improvement</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ysrTGjBrrX5owa6oGmZ6Gm" name="honor-magic-8-lite-04" alt="The round camera island of the Honor Magic 8 Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ysrTGjBrrX5owa6oGmZ6Gm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of design and ergonomics, the Magic 8 Pro is a far nicer phone to hold. That has less to do with materials used and more to do with the overly flat design the Magic 8 Lite uses, particularly on the backside. Some people like the trend of fully flat phones with flat sides, but I am not one of those people. Curves fit human hands better than flat objects, and I'm just really not sure why this has become a trend with this year's releases.</p><p>Honor also really needs to work on its haptics. Even Honor's best phones use lesser-tier haptics, and the ones in the Magic 8 Lite feel undeniably cheap. They're so bad they make me question the build quality of the phone, even though I know it's better than these make it feel.</p><p>Honor is also sticking with its awful 2-year update promise for countries outside of Europe where this phone is sold, meaning you'll only see Android 17 on the Magic 8 Lite before Honor drops support. It's clear this is a model more geared toward Europe than anywhere else, and that affects my ability to recommend it outside of that continent.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

main camera is typically excellent at 1x or 2x zoom, things fall apart quickly at 3x and beyond. Zooming in to 3x and beyond almost always creates an extremely oversharpened, digital-looking image that lacks contrast and often has poor color accuracy.</p><p>Aside from poor zoom quality, I've found several instances where the camera will overexpose a shot in random lighting conditions, creating a cheap look and feel to the images. This problem doesn't seem to carry over to the 5MP ultrawide sensor, which does a much better job with colors and exposure, but lacks detail because of the low resolution.</p><p>Camera speed can be extremely hit or miss, as well. There's no quick launch option on this phone, so the quickest way to launch it is to turn the screen on and swipe to enter the camera. There's no way to double-press a button and launch the camera. Couple that with a long load time for the viewfinder, which can sometimes take 3-4 seconds when the phone is busy, and you end up with a frustratingly inconsistent experience.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-the-competition"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: The competition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8awPRuDVzc74Uc5BCcrwk9" name="oneplus-nord-4-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8awPRuDVzc74Uc5BCcrwk9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this price range, you have to pick your battles. The Magic 8 Lite excels in battery life, charging speed, and durability, but the Motorola Edge 60 Fusion offers a nicer feeling vegan leather build with a 1.2m drop rating and IP69 ingress protection at a much lower price.</p><p>If you're looking for a different style and don't like Honor's UI or hardware designs, the OnePlus Nord 4 or Nothing Phone 3a, and Nothing Phone 3a Pro all offer stunning designs with cleaner OS's. Camera quality and durability isn't as good on those phones, but they offer great software experience that Android fans will be more approving of.</p><p>Of course, you can't count out Samsung to offer something for every price range, either. The Galaxy A36 is a bit cheaper but is slightly worse in every way, while just a tad more money will get you a Galaxy A56 with a faster processor and better cameras. Both of these phones have harsh, flickering displays and substantially worse battery life, but Samsung's software update policy and its rich features might be a better fit for some people.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-should-you-buy"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: Should you buy?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4CB5rKZTtZjZu2ra6SEDK" name="honor-magic-8-lite-wet-02" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Lite with water on its back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4CB5rKZTtZjZu2ra6SEDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want class-leading battery life and durability</li><li>You live in Europe and want a phone with six years of software support</li><li>Samsungs OLEDs give you a headache (this one won't)</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You often take photos using 3x zoom and beyond</li><li>You live outside of Europe (only 2 years of software updates promised globally)</li><li>You're sensitive to display dithering</li></ul><p>Honor's global update program means there's no reason to buy this phone if you live outside of Europe. A scant 2 years of software updates is terrible by any measure, while European customers get a much better six years of updates for the same hardware. That's particularly a shape since Honor's software is finally at the point where it doesn't feel like a second-rate iOS clone.</p><p>I use a ton of Honor devices regularly and love how well Honor's devices work with each other. The Magic 8 Lite fits in perfectly with that and will work impressively well with other Honor phones, tablets, laptops, and more. Even if you're not a regular Honor user, this phone will last you for days on a single charge and still hang around in case you drop it — yes, even on pavement.</p><p>And while the camera won't be winning any awards for speed or quality — no phone at this price range will, really — the main camera is more than capable of taking great shots from time to time. Of course, overall performance, battery life, and software amenities help make up for some of the phone's few shortcomings, making this an easy recommendation at £399.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><h2 id="where-is-the-honor-magic-8-lite-available-2">Where is the Honor Magic 8 Lite available?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite is available in Europe and China as of December, with a wider worldwide rollout happening just after that.</p><h2 id="does-the-honor-magic-8-lite-use-pwm-dimming-or-dithering-2">Does the Honor Magic 8 Lite use PWM dimming or dithering?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite's OLED display uses DC dimming from 21-100% brightness. At 20% brightness and below, the phone switches to 3840Hz PWM dimming. This high frequency PWM dimming is nearly 10x faster than offered by companies like Apple or Samsung and should prove to be very comfortable, even for flicker-sensitive users.</p><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite uses temporal dithering at all times to create 10-bit color depth. The OLED panel is 8-bit by default, and a 2-bit software dithering algorithm is employed. There is no way to disable dithering on this phone. Dithering can cause discomfort for some users and make the display unusable for them.</p><h2 id="what-cameras-does-the-honor-magic-8-lite-use-2">What cameras does the Honor Magic 8 Lite use?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite uses a 108mp main camera on the back, which is capable of 10x digital zoom. The phone also employs a 5mp ultrawide camera on the back. The front-facing selfie camera uses a 16mp sensor.</p><h2 id="what-camera-ai-features-are-supported-on-the-magic-8-lite-2">What camera AI features are supported on the Magic 8 Lite?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite supports AI Remove Reflection, AI Eraser, AI Erase Passers-by, AI Upscale, AI Outpainting, AI Cutout, AI Face Tune-Eyes Open, Moving Photo Collage, and Moving Photo Share.</p><h2 id="how-many-software-updates-will-the-magic-8-lite-receive-2">How many software updates will the Magic 8 Lite receive?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite launches with Magic OS 9 (Android 15) and will receive six operating system updates in Europe. That includes six years of security updates during that time. Magic OS 10, based on Android 16, is expected in April 2026.</p><p>Other parts of the world will only receive two major OS updates and two years of security updates.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, that old experience is finally gone.</p><p>Google Drive on the web is getting rid of its old, clunky viewer. What used to be a basic, sometimes frustrating way to open PDFs, images, and videos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/12/google-drive-web-modern-file-viewer-interface.html" target="_blank">is being replaced</a> with a cleaner, more useful workspace.</p><p>This update fixes common complaints about how you move around, organize, and use the Drive viewer. If you spend a lot of time jumping between documents or reviewing media straight from your browser, you’ll feel the difference immediately.</p><h2 id="pdfs-in-drive-finally-make-sense-2">PDFs in Drive finally make sense</h2><p>The biggest improvement is for PDFs, which have always been a weak spot in Drive. The new viewer now shows a table of contents on the left if the file has one, along with thumbnail previews for every page. You no longer have to scroll endlessly through a hundred-page document hoping to land on the right paragraph.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.56%;"><img id="Lqex8CcbQ3soQEQ9cazqSF" name="Google-Drive-file-viewer-new" alt="Google Drive file viewer on the web with a left sidebar for table of contents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lqex8CcbQ3soQEQ9cazqSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="937" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This new interface pairs nicely with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drives-new-ai-audio-summaries-make-pdfs-effortless">Drive’s Gemini-powered audio summaries</a>. You can generate and listen to a quick overview right from the side panel, or jump into the “Audio overviews” folder to replay anything you’ve saved.</p><p>Google didn’t stop at PDFs, though. Video files get a surprisingly powerful upgrade with a transcript search tool built right into the viewer. Instead of scrubbing back and forth trying to find the exact moment someone mentions a keyword, you can type the word directly into the transcript and jump straight to that point in the video.</p><p>This feature saves you time right away, especially if you work with long recordings or meeting videos.</p><p>All of this sits atop a refreshed interface that looks cleaner and behaves more predictably. The toolbar has been redesigned, the file menu is more intuitive, and the overall layout feels less cramped.</p><p>The rollout is already underway for users on Google’s Rapid Release track, while Scheduled Release domains will begin seeing the new viewer starting December 11, 2025.

There are currently Modes in Android for Do Not Disturb, Bedtime, and Driving. In a future update, Google could add a "Transiting" mode for commuters.</p><p>Android Authority discovered code related to a new Mode in the latest Android Canary release. The so-called Transiting Mode features a "while transiting" trigger that could automatically enable the Mode when your Android phone detects you're on a bus or train. It would work similar to Driving Mode, which has its own triggers based on motion sensors and Bluetooth connections that are used for activation.</p><p>Here are the exact code strings that preview a possible Mode for public transit:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="zen_mode_trigger_title_transit">While transiting</string><string name="zen_mode_inspiration_transit">Optimize your device for a smoother public transit experience</string><string name="zen_mode_blurb_transit">Enjoy a better transit ride with automatic settings adjustments</string></code></pre><p>The Mode will make "automatic settings adjustments," according to the code strings, and "optimize your device for a smoother public transit experience." It's unclear exactly how Transiting Mode will do that. Like other Modes, the system could adjust volume, notification settings, and ring/vibration preferences automatically.</p><p>It could tap into other work-in-progress features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-could-steal-a-crucial-ios-18-feature-that-helps-curb-motion-sickness">Motion Cues</a>, which have been in the works for over a year. Motion Cues aims to provide visual cues to curb motion sickness, and that's something that could help public transit riders.</p><h2 id="when-transiting-mode-might-publicly-release-2">When Transiting Mode might publicly release</h2><p>The next major Android release is Android 16 QPR3, which is tabbed for a March 2026 launch. However, as Transiting Mode is only a work-in-progress feature revealed by code strings, we don't know for sure when it will be released publicly. If the Transiting Mode code eventually appears in the Android 16 QPR3 beta release channel, that could be a good sign it's nearing an official release.</p><p>For now, Transiting Mode code has only appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Android Canary</a> release channel, which contains the earliest and most experimental Android developer builds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is rolling out a new feature that surfaces the right pass at the right time, based on where you are.</p><p>Instead of digging through a cluttered list of passes at the worst possible time (think boarding gate, train turnstile, or concert security line), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> can now automatically surface the exact pass you need, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/04/google-wallet-nearby-notifications/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports. After teasing it at Google I/O in May, the tech giant is rolling out its “Set up nearby notifications” alerts, a new feature that pops up the right ticket, card, or boarding pass the moment you get close to where you’ll need it.</p><p>So, instead of acting like a digital filing cabinet, Wallet is now becoming context-aware. As you approach a relevant location — an airport terminal, a venue entrance, a transit gate, or even a store where you use a loyalty card — the app sends a push notification that opens the matching pass instantly. You get it with one tap, without scrolling through stacks of passes or guessing which one is correct.</p><h2 id="privacy-trade-off-2">Privacy trade-off</h2><p>Setting up nearby notifications is straightforward. When you open a pass that supports the feature, Wallet prompts you to enable it, which requires granting location access “all the time.”</p><p>This means Google Wallet can continuously track your device's location, even when you are not using the app. It’s a privacy trade-off, but in return, you get a hands-free experience that feels genuinely helpful.</p><p>This rollout blends in another handy travel feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-making-it-easier-to-catch-your-plane-or-train-on-android">automated flight check-in alerts</a>. Users are seeing notifications urging them to "Check in to your flight" well before they head to the airport. It appears Wallet is pulling this data directly from confirmation emails in Gmail.</p><p>This rollout is hitting devices right now, just in time for the holiday travel rush.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A few users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1pew723/timer_now_works_with_aod/" target="_blank">Google Pixel Watch subreddit</a> reported gaining access to the feature after updating the Google Clock app to version 6.11. Others are seeing version 6.10 of the Google Clock app as the newest available version for their Pixel Watch, suggesting this is a limited rollout for now.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1pew723/timer_now_works_with_aod">Timer now works with AOD!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch">r/PixelWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Previously, the Pixel Watch's standard behavior for the always-on display involved darkening open apps and showing a generic digital clock in front of them. When closed or timed out, the Pixel Watch's AOD would return to its saved watch face. Any app that lacks AOD support could use the "Force Global AOD Experience" developer option, which dims the display but keeps your last screen visible or active, as of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5.1</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, not many developers chose to enable the "Force Global AOD Experience" option — including Google. That is, until this Google Clock app update, which allows stopwatches and timers to continue when the AOD is active. Additionally,  it adds AOD support for media controls, including play/pause and next/previous, all with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> flair.</p><p>There are a few limitations of the Clock app's new AOD capabilities. Some frequently-updating graphics and fields are omitted when the AOD is active. Namely, you won't see the countdown ring for timers or the number of seconds remaining. While stopwatches keep the second counter, it also loses the ring.</p><p>You can try to force the Google Clock update on your Pixel Watch by opening the Google Play Store on your smartwatch and scrolling all the way to the bottom. There, you'll find a <strong>Manage apps</strong> button. After tapping it, you can check for a Google Clock update. If available, follow the on-screen prompts to install it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What was once a badge of authenticity has, according to European Union regulators, become a practice designed to trick users. The rules have now caught up with X.</p><p>Following a two-year investigation, the European Commission fined Elon Musk’s X €120 million (about $140 million). This is the first financial penalty issued under the EU’s new Digital Services Act (DSA).</p><p>If you’ve kept up with the ongoing conflict between Musk and European regulators, this outcome might not surprise you. But the reason for the fine hits closer to home for anyone who uses the platform daily.</p><p>At the heart of this €120 million ($140 million) bill is the blue checkmark. It used to indicate that someone was a verified public figure, such as a journalist, celebrity, or politician. After Musk took over, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/twitter-x-could-start-charging-users-subscription-fees">the meaning changed</a>. Now, anyone who pays for a subscription and has a profile picture, display name, and phone number can get the badge.</p><h2 id="your-blue-check-is-deceptive-2">Your blue check is 'deceptive'</h2><p>The EU decided this change was misleading. Without proper identity checks, users can’t easily tell if an account is real. The Commission <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934" target="_blank">said</a> this makes it easier for scams and impersonation to happen.</p><p>The blue checkmark wasn’t the only issue. The advertising database, which should show who buys ads, when, and to whom, was unclear. Important details, such as who paid for the ads, what they were about, and a searchable record, were missing. That fails the DSA’s transparency requirements, the EU says.</p><p>Last but not least, researchers studying disinformation or platform misuse can’t access the needed public data. X’s policies reportedly blocked scraping and imposed delays, turning access into a maze. That too violates the DSA.</p><p>X now has 60 working days to explain how it will fix the blue checkmark problem, and 90 days to meet the rules for ad transparency and data access.</p><p>If X follows the rules, it could set a new standard for how verification works on big platforms, making it clearer, more honest, and less about paying for status. Otherwise, the EU may start issuing regular fines and push for real identity checks instead of just paid subscriptions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After months of rumors and speculation, Samsung finally took the wraps off its first-ever trifolding smartphone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Galaxy Z TriFold was unveiled</a> on December 1, 2025, and it offers many benefits and a whole new user experience compared to the standard Galaxy Z Fold lineup we've all come to know.</p><p>However, Samsung isn't the first to introduce a trifolding smartphone. Huawei unveiled its Mate XT Ultimate last year, which actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">intrigued us quite a bit</a>, and followed it up with a slightly upgraded 's' version, called Huawei Mate XTs, earlier this year.</p><p>Both Huawei and Samsung's trifolding phones offer different form factors and designs. But with Huawei already on its second generation of trifolding phones, does its device actually offer more or better features? How different are these two trifolding phones? Let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkcXWE2aYNQWhQ6PRbQqoS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-tri-fold-supersaf-3" alt="Hands-on images of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkcXWE2aYNQWhQ6PRbQqoS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SuperSaf on YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-the-shape-of-whats-next-in-mobile-innovation">introduced</a> the Galaxy Z TriFold on December 1, 2025. The company didn't showcase the device at an event, but quietly released it through a press release. The Galaxy Z TriFold will be available for purchase in Samsung's home country, South Korea, starting December 12, 2025, for KRW 3,594,000 (~$2,440). The trifolding phone comes in just one color variant called Crafted Black.</p><p>Following the launch in Korea, Samsung will bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to other regions, including China, Taiwan, Singapore, the UAE, and the U.S., but the company hasn't confirmed launch dates for these markets just yet.</p><p>The Huawei Mate XTs was introduced in early September 2025 in China. Currently, the Mate XTs is available only in China, but the brand may launch it globally at a later stage, similar to what it did with the first-generation Mate XT.</p><p>In China, the Mate XTs starts at 17,999 CNY (~$2,550) for the base model with 256GB storage and 16GB RAM. It goes up to 21,999 CNY (~$3,100) for the top model with 1TB storage and 16GB RAM. Unlike the Galaxy Z TriFold, the Mate XTs comes in four colors: Red, Black, Purple, and White.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-design-and-build-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Design and build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BkMdRqz7xdVRPZmhfhw9m7" name="huawei-mate-xts-1" alt="Image of Huawei Mate XTs from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BkMdRqz7xdVRPZmhfhw9m7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The difference in design between traditional slab smartphones and even book-style foldables is limited due to their similar form factor, but when you have two movable hinges and three foldable display parts (hence the name 'trifold'), the result is exactly the difference you get between the Galaxy Z TriFold and the Huawei Mate XTs, with both opting for very different approaches.</p><p>On the Huawei Mate XTs, you get a single large 10.2-inch foldable display that folds twice (almost in a Z shape) to form the cover display, which works and looks like a traditional smartphone, though one edge is made of a plastic foldable panel. The Mate XTs can then unfold twice, first into a book-style foldable similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-new-foldable-is-insanely-thin-and-packs-a-huge-battery-but-itll-cost-you">Oppo Find N5</a>, and then fully open into a large 10-inch tablet-like display.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold takes a different approach. Samsung says that in order to protect the inner foldable display, since it's quite sensitive, it designed the hinge system differently.</p><p>Think of the Galaxy Z TriFold as a U-shaped foldable with two vertical sides folding inward. The cover display is a completely separate outer screen that measures 6.5 inches and is actually the same panel used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>'s cover display. This cover display boasts up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness and supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-7" alt="Two Galaxy Z TriFolds next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of build, Samsung seems to take the lead since it uses advanced and premium materials such as Corning Glass Ceramic 2 for the outer cover display, while the rest of the phone is protected by ceramic glass fiber reinforced polymer and an Advanced Armor Aluminum frame for maximum durability.</p><p>The company has also used two titanium hinges for extra strength to protect the foldable from drops and jerks. Moreover, despite being Samsung's first trifolding phone, the company has paid close attention to durability, with the device offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-waterproof">IP48 dust- and water-resistance</a>.</p><p>Using the same folding display as the cover display keeps the Mate XTs from having a larger profile. The Mate XTs is thinner than the Galaxy Z TriFold when unfolded, with a 3.6mm vs 3.9mm profile, and in general, the Mate XTs has a slightly smaller footprint than the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>Coming to the specs of the foldable displays used on both phones, Samsung again takes the lead. The Galaxy Z TriFold's inner foldable display is a large 10-inch LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a 1584 x 2160 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,600 nits of peak brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vWpVCJY8m2ZJSxKB88xi3T" name="samsung-galaxy-z-tri-fold-supersaf-4" alt="Hands-on images of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWpVCJY8m2ZJSxKB88xi3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SuperSaf on YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Mate XTs has a slightly bigger 10.2-inch LTPO OLED panel, and even though it offers a higher 2232 x 3184 resolution, it comes with only a 90Hz refresh rate, which is uncommon for most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a>, let alone a smartphone that costs over $2000.</p><p>Both Samsung and Huawei include a slim kickstand case in the box with their trifolding phones to help the device stand up for watching content or productivity, but the case also acts as hinge protection (or, in Huawei's case, a protector for the exposed part of the screen), making it almost necessary to use.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.58%;"><img id="bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm recently introduced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-benchmarks-reveal-qualcomms-dominance-yet-again">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> processor, and while Samsung foldables usually pack the latest Snapdragon chips, the Galaxy Z TriFold actually uses the previous-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>However, that shouldn't be an issue for anyone looking to buy this trifolding phone since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite is still a very capable chipset</a> and offers more performance and raw power than you'd realistically need from a foldable.</p><p>Huawei's Mate XTs, similar to other smartphones from the brand, uses the company's own Kirin 9020 chipset. For those unaware, this is an octa-core chip with one core clocked at 2.4GHz, three at 2.00GHz, and four at 1.6GHz. This chipset, however, won't match the performance that the Snapdragon 8 Elite delivers on the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iRSTzWU8zbhahjzbRbgWNX" name="huawei-mate-xts-5" alt="A person using the Huawei Mate XTs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRSTzWU8zbhahjzbRbgWNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of other internal hardware, the Galaxy Z TriFold comes with a minimum of 512GB of onboard storage and goes up to 1TB. The Huawei Mate XTs starts at 256GB and also offers 512GB and 1TB variants. Both phones offer 16GB RAM across all models.</p><p>For battery life, both phones pack large 5,600mAh batteries.

However, it's worth noting that the Huawei foldable, similar to most Huawei smartphones, doesn't offer 5G compatibility in most global regions.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</p></th><th  ><p>Huawei Mate XTs</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 (Android 16)</p></td><td  ><p>HarmonyOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Cover display: 6.5-inch, FHD+, Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2600 nits peak brightness, 120Hz, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p><p>Main display: 10-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 1600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Main display: 10.2-inch, LTPO OLED, 90Hz, 2232 x 3184 pixels </p><p>Cover display (1/3rd of the main screen): 6.4-inch, LTPO OLED, 90Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Stylus support</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td><td  ><p>Kirin 9020</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB / 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 10MP telephoto (3x) + 12MP ultra-wide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 40MP ultra-wide + 12MP periscope telephoto (5.5x)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10MP</p></td><td  ><p>8MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td><td  ><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p><strong>4G only</strong>, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor (side-mounted), Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor (side-mounted), Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,600 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,600mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W USB-C fast wired charging<br><br>15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>66W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p>50W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Folded: 159.2 x 75 x 12.9 mm</p><p>Unfolded: 159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9 mm</p><p>Weight: 309g</p></td><td  ><p>Folded: 156.7 x 73.5 x 12.8 mm</p><p>Unfolded: 156.7 x 219 x 3.6 mm</p><p>Weight: 298g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Crafted Black</p></td><td  ><p>Red, Black, Purple, White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Finally, one advantage the Huawei Mate XTs has over the Galaxy Z TriFold is support for stylus input. Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy Z TriFold doesn't support S Pen input, but Huawei sells a separate stylus for the Mate XTs that takes the productivity of the device to another level.</p><p>Speaking of productivity, let's take a look at the software you get on both devices. The Galaxy Z TriFold, as expected, runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-expands-finally-for-galaxy-s25-and-foldables-ai-features-and-enhanced-security">One UI 8</a> out of the box based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a>, complete with new trifolding-focused features like a standalone DeX mode that turns the foldable into a full computing device for complex tasks.</p><p>In DeX mode on the Galaxy Z TriFold, apps open in windows like on a laptop, and you can also create multiple desktops to keep different windows organized. Samsung also allows you to run three different apps side by side on the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>On the other hand, the Huawei Mate XTs, since it's a China-only device for now, runs on the company's HarmonyOS 5.1. The foldable comes with many productivity features, including stylus support for workspace apps like Docs, OfficeSuite, and Notes. However, as with other Huawei smartphones, it doesn't support Google Play services out of the box.</p><p>This means you can't install apps from the Play Store like you would on the Galaxy Z TriFold and instead have to rely on Huawei's AppGallery for third-party apps.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qcUaGA4nYXrLHJvwUaWZtU" name="huawei-mate-xts-2" alt="Cameras of the Huawei Mate XTs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcUaGA4nYXrLHJvwUaWZtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The closest these two foldable phones probably get is in terms of the camera. Both the Huawei Mate XTs and the Galaxy Z TriFold come with a triple-camera system. In fact, the setup on the Galaxy Z TriFold is exactly the same as the one on the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>This means you get a 200MP primary camera with PDAF and OIS, paired with a 10MP telephoto sensor offering up to 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide sensor with a 120-degree FoV.</p><p>On the Huawei Mate XTs, you get a lower-resolution 50MP primary sensor, but the telephoto camera is a better 12MP unit with up to 5.5x optical zoom clarity. Similarly, the ultrawide sensor on the Mate XTs appears stronger thanks to a 40MP sensor.</p><p>We haven't tested the cameras on both devices yet, but given that the Galaxy Z TriFold uses the same sensors and chipset as the Z Fold 7, we expect similar performance. We also haven't gone hands-on with the Mate XTs, but once we do, we'll share a more detailed look at their camera performance.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to choosing between the Galaxy Z TriFold and the Huawei Mate XTs, it's not as simple as picking between two Android flagships. The real challenge isn't just the difference in specs or features, but sheer availability.</p><p>Both phones use extremely new form factors and are very expensive to manufacture, making them difficult to find. The Galaxy Z TriFold is currently launching only in Korea, and even after that, it'll open for sales only in the UAE, China, Taiwan, Singapore, and next year in the U.S.</p><p>Similarly, we don't yet know when the Huawei Mate XTs will be available globally. If Huawei follows the Mate XT's rollout, it'll likely launch in Q1 2026. That said, even if Huawei does bring it to global markets, it won't come to the U.S, and the lack of 5G connectivity and no Google Play services will remain major downsides, likely making the Galaxy Z TriFold a better purchase if both are available in your region.</p><p>It's worth noting that we haven't used either device yet, so the final verdict is still out.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c6e8e0fb-26c4-4163-bfef-a11b68c3645c">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJKygHEi5oBmEN8fNhEH6a.jpg' alt="Product box image of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>First trifolding phone coming to the U.S.</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold isn't available in global markets just yet, but the company has confirmed it'll launch in early 2026.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold waterproof?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Best answer:</strong> The Samsung Galaxy TriFold foldable phone is water-resistant, rated IP48. This denotes some resistance to both dust exposure and water. It isn't as high a dust-resistance rating as you'll find with other premium phones, but the water resistance is in line with most others and relatively impressive for a foldable phone.</p></article></section><h2 id="what-is-an-ip48-rating-2">What is an IP48 rating?</h2><p>The Ingress Protection (IP) rating confirms both dust and water resistance. The first number pertains to dust resistance, and the second to water. Based on the number 4, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</a> can withstand exposure to solid objects 1mm or larger. This is not quite as high as other phones that meet the highest 6 rating and can withstand smaller dust particles. But it's typical for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> since the hinge design makes it challenging to avoid damage if dust should get caught inside.</p><p>In terms of water resistance, the 6 represents the phone's ability to be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. So, you can dunk it in the bathtub or pool, walk with it in the rain or snow, or even a quick accidental drop in the toilet won't render it dead.</p><p>Keep in mind that any IP rating applies only to freshwater sources, so you should still avoid exposing the phone to saltwater, heavily chlorinated public pools, or high temperatures, such as in a bubble bath, hot tub, or sauna. What's more, you should reconsider bringing it to the beach without a phone pouch since it is not protected against small grains of sand.</p><p>With that said, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold's water-resistant rating is still impressive. It falls in line with other Samsung foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, as well as foldables from different brands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a>.</p><p>There are some foldable phones that do meet a higher water-resistance rating, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> with an IP68 rating and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> with an IP58 and IP59 rating.</p><p>The uniquely designed Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold opens up on either side to deliver a tablet-sized screen for productivity and entertainment. With this rating, you can take it just about anywhere. Even so, it's advisable to proceed with caution when it comes to water-resistance ratings, as this degrades over time. If you plan to invest in this exciting new concept, grab a protective case once available and limit exposure to water, despite the generous rating. But if it gets wet, fear not. It'll be just fine.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="eecd9931-3610-4ccc-985c-8b0ab65ef4f5">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isAoL5q4Ju5wkYovSpMZSb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It folds two ways</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone folds out on either side to reveal a large 10-inch, tablet-sized screen. This is thanks to the high-strength frame and folding mechanism.

Samsung may finally let us skip the special cases and get magnetic charging built in.</p><p>A new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,155380.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> says Samsung is working on its own Qi2 magnetic wireless charging dock (model EP-P2900) for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">Galaxy S26 series</a>. This backs up earlier rumors that Samsung is finally giving Galaxy fans what they’ve wanted for years: a real MagSafe-style magnetic charging system for Android.</p><p>Samsung has danced around magnetic accessories for multiple generations of phones. More recently, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">introduced Qi2-certified wireless chargers</a>, but not a true standards-based magnetic charging experience built directly into Galaxy hardware. The newly surfaced Qi2 dock suggests that’s about to change.</p><p>Qi2, if you haven’t been keeping track, is the next-gen wireless charging standard that borrows the alignment tech Apple made mainstream.</p><h2 id="shattering-the-15w-speed-barrier-2">Shattering the 15W speed barrier</h2><p>WinFuture’s report points to Samsung’s first-party dock charging at 25W. That immediately sets it apart, because Samsung historically caps its wireless charging speeds at 15W.</p><p>The retailer data indicates this is likely using the newer Qi2.2 standard and is listed in a Dark Gray colorway. This charger is reportedly built to juice up not just the new Galaxy S phones, but also Galaxy Z foldables and even Galaxy Buds, signaling a unified approach to Samsung’s ecosystem.</p><p>This change is bigger than just one accessory. If Samsung adopts Qi2, Android’s biggest brand will finally have a unified magnetic system. Google’s Pixel 10 series recently added built-in magnets, but Galaxy users have needed special "Qi2 Ready" cases. You got magnets, but only if you bought a certain case, which was confusing for most people.</p><p>Before getting too excited about fast wireless charging everywhere, keep in mind there’s a catch. Rumors say only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-series-may-finally-boost-charging-speeds-for-a-faster-user-experience">Galaxy S26 Ultra will get the full 25W wireless charging speed</a>. The standard Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will likely be limited to 20W.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the phone's name, the Galaxy Z TriFold only folds twice, but it packs a massive 10-inch AMOLED display inside with three sections. Although the company revealed the phone's full specs, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor and the Android 16-based One UI 8, pricing and availability details are a bit more secretive.</p><p>Samsung confirmed the Galaxy Z TriFold will launch in South Korea first on Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time, and it will cost roughly 3.59 million won (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/samsung-unveils-first-multi-folding-phone-competition-set-heat-up-2025-12-02/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>), which converts to roughly $2,440.17. However, regional pricing isn't that simple, and the Galaxy Z TriFold will likely cost closer to $3,000 in the U.S. — if the difference between Korean and U.S. pricing for phones like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is any indication.</p><p>It's possible that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> could debut in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE before the end of 2025. However, U.S. customers will have to wait longer to get their hands on the new foldable phone. "Galaxy Z TriFold will be available in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026 with more details to be shared later," Samsung said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-shape-whats-next-mobile-innovation/" target="_blank">newsroom post</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Galaxy Z TriFold unveiled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold may be released in limited quantities in the U.S. The phone will initially be offered "at select retail stores in respective launch countries for hands-on discovery of this exciting new device and in-store assistance," according to the company.

I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-11-review">iQOO 11</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, and it was with the iQOO 12 that the Vivo sub-brand really got its act together in terms of the cameras. With the iQOO 15, it isn't changing much — the phone has an even bigger AMOLED panel, a huge 7,000mAh battery, a trio of 50MP rear cameras, and it comes with the latest Qualcomm silicon.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/heres-why-the-poco-f8-ultra-isnt-coming-to-india">POCO fumbling its strategy</a> by not introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra</a> in India, iQOO has one less contender to deal with. However, iQOO's positioning this year means the iQOO 15 has increased rivalry from the likes of the Realme GT 8 Pro. While iQOO did a good job maintaining roughly the same price over the last three generations, the iQOO 15 gets a significant price hike this time around.</p><p>That makes the phone not as good a value against its predecessors, and pits it against phones with better camera systems. Does it still make sense to consider the phone? I used the iQOO 15 for just over two weeks now, and here's what I think.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-15-pricing-and-availability-get-ready-to-pay-a-lot"><span>iQOO 15 pricing and availability: Get ready to pay a lot</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xZwzqr96xSoZfhAMEpdJje" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZwzqr96xSoZfhAMEpdJje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iQOO 15 made its debut in India on November 26 — the same day as the global launch of the POCO F8 Ultra — and the phone is available in the country for ₹72,999 ($810). That's for the 12GB/256GB variant, and the 16GB/512GB model costs ₹79,999 ($888) in the country. To put that into context, the iQOO 13 debuted at ₹54,999 ($610) for the 12GB/256GB configuration, and ₹59,999 ($665) for the 16GB/512GB model.</p><p>I don't really understand what iQOO is thinking this year; we just don't see such a drastic price hike, and in doing so, it effectively killed any early interest in the device — particularly with the iQOO 13 still available in the country.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-15-doesn-t-stand-out-as-much"><span>iQOO 15 doesn't stand out as much</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cVHbjCdnDe4wJBpueZxAje" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVHbjCdnDe4wJBpueZxAje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've always enjoyed using iQOO phones because of the brand's ostentatious designs, but I just don't see that from the iQOO 15. The brand doesn't have a model that stands out this year, and the black color variant I'm using is so it dull it may have been a OnePlus phone.</p><p>There isn't anything to indicate that you're using a high-end phone, and the iQOO 15 just doesn't convey a sense of excitement. That's what I look for in a new phone, and the POCO F8 Ultra does this really well thanks to the new denim texture. The iQOO 15, on the other hand, just feels like a giant slab of a phone with about as much character as boiled lettuce.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4435px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="xFox9c7mf9sTnCGqpqWzSe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFox9c7mf9sTnCGqpqWzSe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4435" height="2498" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4435px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EqUviqLdKsCVoYJYgoEHSe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EqUviqLdKsCVoYJYgoEHSe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4435" height="2498" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3AGitQEusCWuDSx3LFYGZe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AGitQEusCWuDSx3LFYGZe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4506px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="QLBjZxxSzTtHTT6ityQ7Ve" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QLBjZxxSzTtHTT6ityQ7Ve.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4506" height="2538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The phone has a fiberglass rear and aluminum mid-frame, and it is on the bigger side thanks to the 6.85-inch panel. It is also heavier at 216g, and that's down to the 7,000mAh battery. Weight distribution is decent enough, but it isn't the most comfortable to hold or use. Thankfully, iQOO retained IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, and the ultrasonic sensor does a good job with authentication.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-is-a-true-powerhouse"><span>This is a true powerhouse</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="C7cfpJ7tpWYRqVBtB3oKie" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7cfpJ7tpWYRqVBtB3oKie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other brands, iQOO is still using a 2K (3168 x 1440) panel, and the 6.85-inch AMOLED is one of the biggest in this category. It has bright colors, excellent brightness levels, and does a great job with Dolby Vision and HDR content in general. While iQOO advertises this as a 144Hz panel, it only switches to the higher resolution in select situations, and in most daily usage tasks, you'll get the same 120Hz as most other phones today.</p><p>The phone does a good job while gaming as well, and although the stereo sound isn't that loud or detailed — the F8 Ultra blows it out of the water — it is serviceable. Annoyingly, iQOO limits popular titles like Call of Duty and PUBG to 60fps, so although these games can hit 120fps on other phones, you don't get that on the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Kcdf4Q8t2LcuFPCk8WbSZe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kcdf4Q8t2LcuFPCk8WbSZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the iQOO 15 isn't quite as good with sustained performance. It handles demanding games without any hassle, but there is noticeable throttling with extended use, and it overheats — similar to all other Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices I tested. This is more to do with Qualcomm than iQOO, and although the phone has a bigger vapor cooling system this year, it still crossed 52 degrees in synthetic tests, and got uncomfortably hot in extended gaming scenarios.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KKSZkW8qxcPBY23RqtVCfe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKSZkW8qxcPBY23RqtVCfe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the hardware is quite decent; the phone gets LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.1 storage modules, and the 16GB/512GB model I've been using didn't have any slowdowns or lag. The vibration motor is much better this generation, and I didn't run into any issues with connectivity.</p><p>Thanks to the 7,000mAh silicon battery, the iQOO 15 easily lasts a day and a half, and you can get it to last two days with regular use. The phone gets 100W charging tech, and it takes just under an hour to charge.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-you-get-great-cameras-with-the-iqoo-15"><span>You get great cameras with the iQOO 15</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="aZWpzzw7zhjhpPPMAR4EXe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZWpzzw7zhjhpPPMAR4EXe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4400" height="2478" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the cameras, the iQOO 15 gets a 50MP Sony IMX921 main camera, alongside a 50MP Sony IMX881 tele lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens. There's a 32MP GalaxyCore GC32 selfie camera, and it gets 4K60 video.</p><p>The main camera and tele lenses do a great job (as you'd imagine), and the phone benefits from Vivo's tuning. I have no issues with the quality of the photos; the phone consistently delivered great shots in challenging shooting conditions, and the tele lens doubles as a portrait shooter.</p><div

good. It still produces decent photos, but you don't quite get the same quality, and that's down to the sensor of choice. Samsung's JN1 is starting to show its age, and other brands have switched to newer modules that are much better. Clearly, Vivo either had sensors left over and pulled a Samsung, or it decided to save costs by using the older module.</p><p>Regardless, the other two cameras on the iQOO 15 are great, and it does a good job against the POCO F8 Ultra and Galaxy S25.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-15-has-better-software-this-year"><span>iQOO 15 has better software this year</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="2XE55DpHSzGUDzybbw7Rae" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XE55DpHSzGUDzybbw7Rae.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4975" height="2802" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iQOO 15 comes with OriginOS 6 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, and it is identical to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a> and X300. The new interface feels fresh, it has excellent fluidity, and I don't have much in the way of negatives.

It isn't as clear-cut a choice as previous years because of the price hike, but I still believe the iQOO 15 is positioned well in the Indian market. Its cameras may not beat the Realme GT 8 Pro or the regular Vivo X300 and Find X9, but it is a legitimate rival, and the fact that POCO didn't launch the F8 Ultra in the country makes things easier for the Vivo sub-brand.</p><p>I'd still recommend getting the iQOO 13; its cameras are good, and the hardware isn't slow by any measure. The iQOO 15 is a definite upgrade, but it misses out on being anywhere as good a value as its predecessor.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The report cites an internal memo from Maher Saba, who is the vice president of Meta's Reality Labs Foundation. It reveals that Meta's next-generation pair of mixed-reality glasses will now release in 2027 instead of 2026. Plus, there's reportedly a prototype wearable and a new Quest headset in the works.</p><p>The company originally planned to launch the mixed-reality glasses, code-named "Phoenix," in the second half of 2026. Now, the glasses are positioned for a release in the first half of 2027. The minor delay is intended to give Meta "a lot more breathing room to get the details right," according to a separate memo seen by Business Insider.</p><p>"There's a lot coming in hot with tight bring-up schedules and big changes to our core UX, and we won't compromise on landing a fully polished and reliable experience," wrote Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns, per the report.</p><p>Separately, the memo penned by Saba references a "limited edition" wearable variant code-named "Malibu 2" in 2026. The next Meta Quest headset will also be a "large upgrade" that will "significantly improve unit economics," according to Aul and Cairns.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k" name="meta-quest-3s-apple-iphone-17-pro-max-orange" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset behind an orange iPhone 17 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the memos don't reference the situation specifically, it sounds like these delays may be in relation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">Meta's design leadership change</a> announced this week.

The update initially debuted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>, and later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-just-got-android-16-proving-budget-phones-dont-have-to-wait">made its way to older Nothing Phone models</a> by Nov. 28. However, Nothing Phone users have reported bugs with Nothing OS 4, and the launch has been rocky. In fact, it looks like Nothing has paused the Nothing OS 4 rollout entirely as it works to fix some of the update's issues.</p><p>The first sign that Nothing OS 4's rollout may have been halted came on Dec. 1, when a  report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techiboy.com/nothing-os-4-0-stable-update-disappears-for-some-users-heres-what-happened/" target="_blank">Techiboy</a> noted that the update appeared to disappear from user devices. Now, a post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1pfkgtq/nothing_os_40_rollout_has_been_paused/" target="_blank">u/nikhkin on Reddit</a> claims that the Nothing OS 4 release was indeed paused. The post cites a screenshotted email from Nothing's support team  responding to the customer's inquiry into why their Nothing Phone 3 hadn't received the Android 16 update yet.</p><p>"We have received feedback from the relevant team and we ... regret to inform you we have temporarily halted and removed the current 4.0 rollout and are working on an urgent fix," the screenshotted email, claimed to be from a Nothing support representative, explained. "Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to deliver a stable update as soon as possible."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1pfkgtq/nothing_os_40_rollout_has_been_paused">Nothing OS 4.0 rollout has been paused</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech">r/NothingTech</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The support email contains a few grammatical errors, but appears to be authentic and from Nothing support. Android Central reached out to Nothing to confirm the Nothing OS 4 rollout has been paused, but the company did not respond in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The email does not mention the specific bug or issue affecting the stable Nothing OS 4 build, but says the company is working on "an urgent fix." Once the patched version passes Nothing's internal testing, it will roll out to users, according to the email. Users who already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-arrives-for-the-phone-3-with-exclusive-features-refined-glyph-interface-and-more">Nothing OS 4</a> are set to receive a patched version of the update, and the Android 16 rollout will open for users who didn't get a chance to update.</p><p>It's unclear when the patched Nothing OS 4 build will resume rolling out, but we've asked Nothing for clarification.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's similar to what Samsung did with the first Galaxy Z Fold, using a big box to deliver a more premium first impression.</p><p>Inside the box, you get the Galaxy Z TriFold laid out fully unfolded, a SIM ejector, a USB-C cable, and a slim case made to cover the device's spine for protection when closed. A rare addition is a 45 W charger included in the box, something missing from devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Given the price, though, this inclusion is expected.</p><p>In terms of first impressions, when folded, the cover screen looks similar to the 6.5-inch outer display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> with comparable bezels. However, the video notes that the device is quite heavy at 309 g, making it much heavier than the Z Fold 7.</p><p>When fully unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold becomes an extremely slim device measuring just 3.9 mm at its thinnest point. Since it uses a U-shaped tri-fold design, both sides fold inward individually toward the center, and the video even shows an animation that appears if you fold it incorrectly.</p><p>Once unfolded, the device offers a big 10.1-inch 16:11 display similar to an Android tablet. Arun notes that this improves app usability and information density compared to current foldables. Apps like Samsung Health, Files, and YouTube take full advantage of the larger canvas with optimized layouts and more visible content.</p><p>Samsung mentioned in its press release that the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first device with standalone Samsung DeX, and the video confirms it completely transforms the phone into a full computing device. It supports resizable windows, multi-app layouts, and a full desktop-style environment.</p><p>All things considered, the Galaxy Z TriFold looks like a promising device based on the video. It costs about $2,400 in Korea and goes on sale starting December 12, 2025. There's no U.S. pricing yet, but the foldable will likely cost slightly more than in Samsung's home market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr-beta-webcam-feature-video-quality">originally added in Android 14 QPR1</a>, but Google Pixel devices are still the only Android phones to support it. By supporting the USB Video Class webcam standard, you can plug in a Pixel to a host device and use the phone's camera as a webcam. Now, this feature works with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>As spotted by user Nadir92 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1996928794532438194">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phone-as-switch-2-webcam-3622443/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Switch 2's GameChat feature now works with Pixel phones. By connecting a USB-C cable between your Switch 2 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phone</a>, you'll be able to use the phone's live camera feed for GameChat.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now, it works! #GooglePixel #NintendoSwitch2 https://t.co/2mfCEGSuBn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996711176126796110">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nintendo's new GameChat feature is a key feature addition for the Switch 2, making it possible to play games in an immersive group environment with friends. After connecting a webcam, users can join a group video call and share their screens. This works across games, and is a clever way to play Switch 2 games remotely with others. There's just one problem — the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have an onboard camera.</p><p>Nintendo says the Switch 2's GameChat feature supports most USB webcams. The company even sells a first-party camera accessory for $50 specifically designed for Game Chat. However, it's on the larger side, and makes more sense for a home gaming setup than a portable solution.</p><p>That's why a smartphone — a device with multiple cameras and a USB-C port that most people already carry with them — makes perfect sense for GameChat use on the Switch 2. Unfortunately, the Google Pixel USB webcam mode wasn't compatible with GameChat when the Switch 2 launched. Now, that has been resolved, and Pixel phone users have a convenient GameChat webcam they always have nearby.</p><p>It's unclear whether an update from Google or Nintendo made these devices more compatible. Either way, it's a win for Switch 2 owners who also have a Pixel, as they just unlocked a new method for using GameChat.</p> ]]></dc:content>

People come up with lofty, vague plans like "learn a language" or "lose weight." They spend the holidays gorging on rich foods, then hit January tired, bloated, and back at work. Most people make a half-hearted effort for a week, then fall back on old routines by "Quitter's Day."</p><p>In my case, 2025 isn't over, but I've completed (or will complete) 32 of my 40 resolutions for the year. I wish I could have done more; I never got far with my goals for cycling, push-ups, and novel writing. But resolutions aren't some impossible challenge.</p><p>I can help you plan out your New Year's resolutions so that you're set up for success. You can't just buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or download a nutrition app and hope an algorithm will bully you into being healthier. You need to plan them for yourself, and do so <em>right now</em>, not on January 1.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-five-ways-to-make-your-new-year-s-resolutions-successful"><span>The five ways to make your New Year's resolutions successful</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.86%;"><img id="BGouKxoAd6JPkXLStnztVC" name="new-year-lloyd.png" alt="Android Resolutions" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGouKxoAd6JPkXLStnztVC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="560" height="156" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="1-make-resolutions-for-things-you-already-do-2">1.

We have finite time and mental energy outside of our 9-to-5s, and working new things into your schedule means sacrificing other things.</p><p>Before you make ambitious new plans for 2026, start by creating resolutions that <strong>fit within your current, established routine and hobbies</strong>, only slightly different or harder. That way, you're primed for success, and as you log these completed goals, you'll then be motivated to track and try your more <em>challenging</em> resolutions.</p><ul><li>If you read 20 books in 2025, aim to read 25 books this year, or 20 but with five in a new genre.</li><li>If you're a runner, try running more miles, hit a new race PR, do X more track or trail workouts, or go to X running club or race events.</li><li>Cooks and bakers could try one new recipe a month, or side dishes that pair with favorite meals.</li><li>If you commute every day, commit to more books, podcasts, or journaling for at least one leg of the trip.</li></ul><h2 id="2-break-down-resolutions-into-monthly-goals-2">2. Break down resolutions into monthly goals</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1261px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zECoeAs9wnVbtFacPCTC44" name="New-Years-resolutions-reading-weight-2025" alt="A Google Docs screenshot showing my Reading and Weight resolution goals, split by month and with bronze, silver, gold, and ace levels of success." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zECoeAs9wnVbtFacPCTC44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1261" height="709" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's say you want to walk 10,000 steps a day in 2026, or work out more; how do you keep yourself accountable? It only takes one bad week to fall off your routine, and then you have no reason to keep trying because you've already failed.</p><p>Instead, <strong>break your resolutions down by month</strong>. Split them out so you can <strong>make up for lost ground</strong> if you start to fall short, or <strong>monitor your progress</strong> toward a long-term goal.</p><p>Here's one example: Instead of "Three gym visits per week," make it "twelve times per month." Compensate for missed days by going more often the following week. If you only go six times in January, that's no excuse to stop; you can aim for eight visits in February, then ten in March.</p><p>The <em>eventual</em> goal is to build a consistent routine, but changing your lifestyle is a struggle, and building in for failed days or weeks makes you less likely to give up entirely.</p><ul><li>Want to walk 10,000 steps per day? That means 300,000 steps total, so you'll have to build in days where you walk <em>more</em> than 10,000 steps, like on weekends, to compensate for days you slack off.</li><li>For vaguer goals like "Drink less alcohol," add each night of drinking to your monthly total. By January's end, if you drank 10 times, that's your baseline, with the goal to decrease that number in subsequent months.</li><li>Similarly, if you want to "lose weight," logging your last weigh-in every month lets you see how you're progressing, or if you're backsliding.</li></ul><h2 id="3-give-yourself-stretch-and-backup-goals-2">3.

Some months, I really slacked off, but because I had the lower 6K and 7K targets, I still had motivation to go out near the end of the month instead of giving up entirely. Other months, I kept pushing after hitting the 240K total, because I could hit a higher goal.</p><ul><li>Want to read more? Maybe 5 books per month is your target, but let yourself aim for 2 (bronze) or 3 (silver) for the months where you don't read for three weeks and need <em>some</em> motivation to finish the month strong.</li><li>Want to do gym or HIIT workouts 10 times per month? Your monthly goals could be to hit five workouts (bronze), eight (silver), ten (gold), and twelve (stretch).</li><li>Want to lose weight? Your bronze goal could simply be to maintain your current weight, which is something to celebrate!</li></ul><h2 id="4-give-yourself-accountability-and-a-vision-2">4.

By the time you hit spring, aiming to hit arbitrary goalposts will get boring, and you'll start to slack off if you let yourself. You need to find a <strong>north star</strong>, a <strong>concrete goal</strong> to work toward.</p><p>In my case, I signed up for a marathon, which gave me <em>months</em> of motivation to run or walk on weekdays, even when I was exhausted from work. I knew the alternative was having a horrible time during the race and wasting my flight and hotel money, so I didn't let myself off the hook; I even started hitting my stretch resolutions.</p><p>To go with your monthly self-perfection resolutions, commit to specific events that mesh with those goals and make lifestyle changes fun instead of onerous.</p><ul><li>Want to hit the gym more? Sign up for Spartan Racing or HYROX, competitive events that give you a concrete reason to train specific muscles: beating your fellow athletes.</li><li>Want to cook or bake more recipes? Maybe you sign up for a class that does the hard parts (finding ingredients and recipes) for you, or even a cooking competition.</li><li>Want to be better about cleaning or fixing up the house? Create a point system for each scrubbed toilet, weeded garden, or fixed floorboard. Then choose rewards you must redeem points for, like 50 points for movie tickets or 500 points for concert or sporting tickets.</li></ul><h2 id="5-start-planning-and-doing-your-new-year-s-resolutions-now-2">5.

You need to build a resolution game plan, with attainable, multi-tier goals for old and new hobbies, all broken down into twelve monthly categories. Then you need to look through local events, classes, clubs, and competitions that could liven up your resolution experience.</p><p>This is a lot of work to plan! That's why I think it's most essential that you <strong>start building your resolutions document now</strong>.</p><p>Not only will you be more prepared to actualize your goals, but you can start testing your resolve and building habits in the second half of December, when you're more likely to have more free time.

However, the company also previewed a more powerful Gemini 3 Deep Think model that underwent extra safety evaluations before its public release.</p><p>Now, Gemini 3 Deep Think is officially ready for use in the Gemini app. It's rolling out now for Google AI Ultra subscribers, Google announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-deep-think/" target="_blank">blog post</a> this week. It's the successor to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, which was previously Google's best AI model for advanced reasoning.</p><p>"This new mode delivers a meaningful improvement in reasoning capabilities, designed to tackle complex math, science and logic problems that challenge even the most advanced state-of-the-art models," Google explains. "It uses advanced parallel reasoning to explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously."</p><p>Gemini 3 Deep Think performs better on top knowledge and reasoning benchmarks than Gemini 3 Pro. In Humanity's Last Exam, Gemini 3 Deep Think scored 41% without tool use. By comparison, the standard Gemini 3 Pro model only reached 37.5% without tools. In the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, Gemini 3 Deep Think scored 45.1% with code execution in a result that Google calls "unprecedented."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN" name="Gemini-3-Deep-Think-benchmarks.jpg" alt="Gemini 3 Deep Think benchmark graphs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the Gemini app, Gemini 3 Deep Think is labeled as being "experimental."

That significantly limits the number of Gemini users who will be able to try the next-generation thinking model.

So far, Deep Think has remained exclusive to AI Ultra, so AI Pro users shouldn't expect to gain access unless something changes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Antigravity is an agentic integrated development environment (IDE) that puts AI at the center of the coding experience. Unlike other IDEs with AI helpers, Google Antigravity lets coders deploy AI agents that can make changes, run code, and check their work independently.</p><p>Google shared an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/new-antigravity-rate-limits-pro-ultra-subsribers/" target="_blank">update</a> Friday, Dec. 5 about the response to Google Antigravity, calling it "incredible." The company says it's working to meet the demand for Antigravity, and it's changing the platform's rate limits accordingly. There are positive changes for both free and paid users, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> still powers the Antigravity development platform for everyone.</p><p>Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers now get priority access to Google Antigravity with the "highest, most generous rate limits." The quotas for Antigravity's rate limits will refresh every five hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BGvb4Q27rPkydDSTQiL9Vj" name="Google-Antigravity-2" alt="The promotional images and UI elements for Google Antigravity." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGvb4Q27rPkydDSTQiL9Vj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Antigravity now uses a weekly-based rate limit for free users. Google says this change is intended to "minimize hitting rate limits quickly during a project." So, instead of needing to spread out work on a project across multiple hours and days to avoid rate limits, free users have another option. They can use up all of their Antigravity usage in one project quickly, but free users may have to wait for the weekly rate limit to reset to gain more access.</p><p>Google Antigravity usage limits aren't calculated by the number of requests or lines of code written. Instead, the rate limits are based on "work done" by Antigravity's AI agent. This means that basic tasks will use up less of your Antigravity quota than those that require complex reasoning.</p><p>The core experience is remaining the same for both free users and Google AI subscribers. "Regardless of your tier, all users will continue to enjoy Gemini 3 Pro, unlimited tab code completions and access to all product features, such as the Agent Manager and Browser integration," Google confirms.</p><p>The entire Gemini 3 suite is experiencing high user demand, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/high-demand-leads-google-to-cap-gemini-3-pro-and-nano-banana-pro-usage">Google capping Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro usage</a> at the end of November. Now, Google is making similar adjustments for Antigravity. However, instead of slashing rate limits, the company is tweaking them to make Antigravity available as much as possible while keeping up with the demand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These are the pillars that made Fitbit a household name. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> have become feature-packed mini-computers, many consumers still crave a device that “just works” without constant charging or complicated interfaces. A ring delivers that promise.</p><p>Unlike a wristband or watch, a ring sits stationary on the finger, offering superior conditions for heart rate and other biometric measurements. Less movement means more accurate readings, a critical differentiator in a market where precision matters. Rings also feel less intrusive, blending seamlessly into daily life.

That segment is under pressure.

Think of the consumer who wears a luxury watch but still slips on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> because health matters. Fitbit deserves to be in that conversation.</p><h2 id="market-signals-2">Market signals</h2><p>Consider the numbers: Oura has shipped 5.5 million rings in its lifetime with virtually no serious competition. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman</a>? Roughly 1 million. Samsung? Under 500,000. Meanwhile, Fitbit — despite aging hardware — shipped over 2 million devices in the first three quarters of 2025, according to IDC. At its peak, Fitbit moved tens of millions annually. With Google’s reach, that scale is achievable again — if you let Fitbit stretch its wings.</p><p>And the trend is undeniable. Rings are gaining traction in the U.S. health and fitness tracker market with an ASP of over $200.

Oura has also capitalized on this playbook, but Fitbit wrote it first. A smart ring would supercharge Fitbit’s ability to re-enter this lucrative segment, offering a discreet, stylish device that employees actually want to wear.</p><h2 id="fashion-meets-function-2">Fashion meets function </h2><p>Health tech is no longer just about utility; it’s about identity. Consumers flaunt luxury watches and designer clothes, yet they still seek cutting-edge health insights — that market is currently served by the likes of Oura and Whoop.

A Fitbit ring could serve double duty: health tracker and XR controller, making it indispensable in Google’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="why-google-needs-this-win-2">Why Google needs this win </h2><p>Let’s be honest: Google’s hardware ambitions have been uneven. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> are gaining traction, but wearables remain a battleground dominated by Apple and Samsung. A Fitbit smart ring isn’t just another SKU — it’s a statement. It says Google understands where the market is headed and is willing to lead, not follow.</p><p>And let's not forget, Valentine’s Day is not far off. What better time to seal the deal with Fitbit fans than by launching a product that symbolizes commitment to health and wellness? A ring isn’t just a device; it’s a statement. Imagine the marketing possibilities: “Show your heart some love.” It practically writes itself.</p><p><strong>About IDC</strong><br>IDC is a leading global provider of technology research, insights, and events.

It's not their responsibility to tell you and me how to raise our kids unless we're doing something wrong enough to break the law.</p><p>The Australian government is caving to the demands of a few loud voices in an attempt to become more popular and boost some politicians' reelection chances. I imagine most parents think the government should let them take the wheel when it comes to raising their kids, rather than telling them that Junior isn't allowed to upload <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-game-review-minecraft-pocket-edition">Minecraft videos</a> once he's finished his homework.</p><p>Google doesn't want anyone — child or not — to have any difficulty having a YouTube account. Even if they can't monetise kids directly, those numbers are a big deal in meetings with advertisers like Coca-Cola who want their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-starts-rolling-out-shoppable-video-ads-worldwide">video ads</a> seen by a bajillion eyeballs. For them, it's all about the money, and they provided enough parental controls to meet both parental and government demands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1696px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.54%;"><img id="UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg" name="YouTube-TV- redesign" alt="YouTube player redesign for TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1696" height="942" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That doesn't answer the question, though; can YouTube be harmful for kids?</p><p><strong>Of course it can be.</strong></p><p>I think YouTube has plenty of problems, but I love the service and use it every day. According to my year-end review from Google, I use it more than 80% of people do. I've seen plenty of great things, but I've also seen some pure garbage. If you use the service, you can say the same: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a> is full of content that kids have no business seeing.</p><p>We might disagree on what that content is. For example, I don't care if my kids watched a video with foul language because I know what they hear in school, and that they probably use at least half of those words when I'm not in earshot. I don't like the idea of them learning how to make a homemade pipe bomb, though, because I think most kids are stupid enough to believe they can try it and not get hurt or hurt anyone else, not that they want to become militant terrorists.</p><p>The point is that we each can decide what our kids see and how often they see it if we want to. Letting the government decide what content is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-old-do-you-have-be-open-gmail-account">age-restricted</a> and then blocking access to it is lazy parenting. That's exactly what the Australian government is trying to do here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google saying "Hey, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-launches-parental-supervised-accounts">parental controls</a> that give you an automated way to let a screen raise your kids" is not any better. Allowing software algorithms to decide on content that meets your criteria is equally lazy. Use them, but don't rely on them because <strong>your 13-year-old kid is smarter than you when it comes to the internet</strong>. They're smarter than Australia's Communications Minister and maybe even smarter than the programmers at YouTube.</p><p>They will find an easy way to see whatever they want to see when you're not there.

Chances are you'll do OK in the long run, though.</p><p>You can't be there every waking second of a teenager's life.

Sometimes they will and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-sued-for-allegedly-contributing-to-teen-suicide">sometimes they won't</a>. If you have teenagers of your own, think back to what it was like for you and how you made decisions. Scary, isn't it?</p><p>Chances are, your teenagers will try some weed or drink some beer. They're going to curse sometimes. They're also going to see things on social media that you disagree with, whether it be on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-extends-its-ban-self-harm-depiction-fictional-posts">Instagram</a>, Twitch, or YouTube.</p><p>What you need to do is try your hardest to teach them your values and hope some of it takes. Do that by treating them respectfully and just talking to them. Spend time together doing both things you like and things they want to do. Putting up with the skibidi toilet 67676767 nonsense phase is worth it because they will outgrow it. When your kids feel they are treated as people, they'll act like people.

While there are stats and features regarding Play Books, Google says that users can expect a gift this weekend: the gift of 15x points. Beginning today (Dec 5) through December 7, users purchasing books can earn 15x the Play Points.</p><p>The company says this boost will apply to all users regardless of their Play Points level.</p><p>Since launching in 2010, Google says Play Books has expanded to over 75 countries and has built a library of "over 10 million ebooks and audiobooks." The company draws attention to its shelves, which helps users organize their books by genre or author. Users are also able to access their Play Books library between devices. Users can quickly pick up their stories from one phone to another (or even a tablet) without a problem.</p><p>Samples in Google Play Books give users a chance to understand the prose or general pacing of a book in question. More than that, the subscription gives users quick alerts when a new title is added to their favorite series.</p><h2 id="happy-birthday-google-play-books-2">Happy Birthday, Google Play Books</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghr9adwnaOE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google Play Books is back in the spotlight after the Play Store celebrated the year's end with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-play-celebrates-its-best-of-2025-winners-for-apps-and-games">typical "Best Of" showcase</a>.

Still, it's not a bad pick for casual users, those surfing the web and streaming movies, or those who are performing basic word processing, spreadsheet, or other netbook-level tasks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-go-14-led-laptop-intel-celeron-4gb-memory-128gb-storage-silver/JJGRF337WW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="bXV3HaAmMzR5rKTPMzM3Zb" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-go.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bXV3HaAmMzR5rKTPMzM3Zb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-go-14-led-laptop-intel-celeron-4gb-memory-128gb-storage-silver/JJGRF337WW" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$329.99</del> <strong>$159.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Even after the biggest sales events of the year have ended, Best Buy is offering buyers $170 off on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go, representing over half off the regular price.

It also has a 14-inch LED display, 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life per charge.</p><p>As for connectivity, the Galaxy Chromebook Go includes two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and a headphone-microphone jack, as well as offering 45W USB-C charging. It also has a 720p selfie cam and built-in microphones for video meetings or recording, as well as a durable 180-degree hinge for multiple viewing angles.</p><p>While it's not an industry-leading device by any stretch of the imagination, Samsung does highlight that the Go features substantially faster performance as well as a WLAN card that's around three times as fast as previous Galaxy Book generations.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For a long time, people who wanted direct political coverage had to use free streams and awkward browser tabs to watch congressional hearings, since C-SPAN wasn’t on YouTube TV. That’s changed this week. YouTube TV now includes C-SPAN, C-SPAN2, and C-SPAN3 in its live TV lineup.</p><p>C-SPAN and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> first struck a deal back in September, agreeing on a modest per-subscriber fee, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/04/youtube-tv-finally-adds-c-span-channels-following-fee-agreement-with-google/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This agreement made it possible for the full launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/cspan-live-on-youtube-tv/" target="_blank">to happen this week</a>.</p><p>Until now, YouTube TV subscribers had to jump through hoops to watch C-SPAN content, relying on the network’s website or scattered livestreams during major political events. That’s no longer the case. The channels are now in the regular guide with other news outlets, and there’s no need for a special add-on.</p><p>This change is also a lifeline for C-SPAN. As more people dropped cable, the network’s revenue fell from about $64 million in 2019 to $45 million in 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newsday.com/business/cspan-media-streaming-congress-l22875" target="_blank">Newsday</a> reported. Joining major streaming bundles became necessary for its survival.</p><h2 id="no-extra-cost-for-youtube-tv-subscribers-2">No extra cost for YouTube TV subscribers</h2><p>For YouTube TV, the cost is low enough that subscribers probably won’t see a price increase because of this change. It’s a win-win: C-SPAN reaches millions of homes without cable, and YouTube TV adds a news channel that many people thought it should have had long ago.</p><p>For viewers, this change is straightforward. You get C-SPAN’s full, unfiltered coverage, now with YouTube TV’s playback controls, search features, and the ability to watch on different devices.</p><p>The bigger point is what this means for streaming overall. If a public-affairs network like C-SPAN can finally join major live-TV services, it could lead to more niche or civic-focused channels moving away from cable too. It also raises the bar: if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming platforms</a> are going to replace cable, it should offer the same variety, including important coverage of government and democracy.</p><p>For a service that prides itself on being a full cable replacement, this addition brings it closer than ever to actually feeling like one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A lot of leaks have already revealed plenty about the Galaxy S26 lineup, and it seems Samsung may have accidentally leaked the designs itself.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-series-designs-software-3622475/">Android Authority</a> in One UI 8.5's source code, there are references to certain renders of Android phones that appear to be the upcoming Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>According to the report, the source code mentions three new Samsung devices with codenames M1, M2, and M3, which correspond to the Galaxy S26 (M1), Galaxy S26 Plus (M2), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> (M3).</p><h2 id="new-one-ui-code-all-but-confirms-the-s26-design-2">New One UI code all but confirms the S26 design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.55%;"><img id="QxHFGe2VmRYUxaMMRFzWQe" name="galaxy-s26-design-one-ui-8-5-source-code" alt="Leaked designs of the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxHFGe2VmRYUxaMMRFzWQe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1502" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the images aren't actual 3D CAD renders like the ones we usually see ahead of launch, they are 2D illustrations of the upcoming devices.

The publication speculates that the phone could have a launch quite soon, likely sometime in December, considering its CQC appearance; however, the main highlight is its massive battery capacity.</p><p>Per the listing, the Honor X80 will seemingly hit the Chinese market sporting a huge 10,000mAh battery.</p><p>The post adds that the battery could also sport "increased durability," potentially pushing forward its longevity for users looking to really go the mile with their phone before charging. Strangely, the publication states that "other details" about the phone are missing in the CQC listing. It's not <em>that </em>strange to have some details left in the dark about a phone during its certification rounds. This just means we'll have to wait until the phone appears officially.</p><p>The post states that the listing did mention 5G cellular connectivity—an unsurprising addition. The folks at Gizmochina add that the Honor X80 has been rumored to sport "improved performance" over its previous iteration, the X70. Additionally, consumers may also find even greater strides toward mobile gaming, which could affect its FPS for higher-intensity games, like Genshin Impact or even Zenless Zone Zero.</p><h2 id="honor-s-making-changes-2">Honor's making changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200-06" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's alleged battery capacity increase for the X80 is roughly 2,000mAh more than what the X70 provided.</p><p>Here's the thing: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/future-honor-android-phones-major-battery-capacity-rumors">rumors about Honor's plans</a> from this past summer claimed something like this <em>could </em>happen. Allegations from July said that Honor was looking at boosting the battery capacity of two phone series: its Magic flagship line and its mid-range X series. These rumors came from tipsters on Weibo (Chinese social media), adding that its mid-range series could see totals between 8,200mAh and 8,400mAh.</p><p>These totals are much lower than what the X80's purported listing dictates, as it's ~1,800mAh higher than those predictions. Nevertheless, an increase could be a reality for those awaiting it in China.</p><p>Those July rumors highlight its flagships, stating totals could rise to a range of 7,020mAh-7,200mAh.</p><p>Those flagship totals were met <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-series-debut-redefines-on-device-ai-imaging-on-device-needs">when the Magic 8 Pro debuted</a> in October, as it was revealed to possess a 7,200mAh battery.

From the looks of it, the Galaxy Z TriFold is incredibly thin (3.9mm), featuring a large display and two panels that fold inwards.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold showcases a 10-inch AMOLED main screen when unfolded, and a 6.5-inch cover screen. Samsung has made two differently sized hinges that ensure a smoother folding experience, allowing the panels to close without leaving any gaps. It has an IP48 rating, which means it is resistant to freshwater immersion and solid objects.</p><p>It comes with a massive 200MP wide-angle sensor with 2x optical-quality zoom, an ultrawide 12MP camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The cover screen features a 10MP selfie camera, while the main screen has a 10MP under-display camera, making it easier to take selfies even when the device is unfolded.</p><p>The device is said to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/one-ui">One UI</a> 8 out of the box, only in one colorway: Crafted Black, landing in the U.S. only in the first quarter of 2026.</p><h2 id="twas-a-week-of-new-feature-drop-for-pixels-and-android-users-2">'Twas a week of new feature drop for Pixels and Android users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R" name="Pixel-10-series-boquet" alt="Pixel 10 series shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:769,l:356,cw:5356,ch:3012,q:80/WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="4284" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/december-drop-google-brings-fresh-updates-for-android-users"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-finally-fights-notification-overload-and-lets-you-kill-ugly-icons"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-December-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will introduce new features to help Android users really focus on the things and people that matter most to them when they pick up their phones — cutting out the unnecessary noise. "See the emotion behind speech in captions, send new emoji combos, and let friends know when your call is important," the Keyword added.</p><p>To start, users can now see and read the emotion behind each video they come across, whether it's a friend's video note or while scrolling through social media — with "Expressive Captions." The feature creates real-time captions, describing the intensity at which a person is speaking, along with ambient noises like [birds chirping], [cheers and applause], etc.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:156.07%;"><img id="6tHdhHN5mqFftVuoZB7H8c" name="Android-16-features" alt="Android 16 notification summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tHdhHN5mqFftVuoZB7H8c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="412" height="643" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Google is unleashing new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own" target="_blank">Emoji Kitchen sticker combos</a>" in time for the holidays, and you will also be able to let friends and family know when your calls are urgent with "Call reason," so they know they should answer.</p><p>Within Google Messages, you will now be able to easily identify and exit unwanted group chats, as Google will send you an alert that "shows key information about the group and tips to stay safe."</p><p>Pixel users also got a major Android 16 update this week, bringing a new "Notification organizer" that automatically groups and silences low-priority pings like news and promos, while AI summaries condense long chat threads for quick context.

Netflix was up against other companies, including Paramount, Skydance, and Comcast.</p><p>This means all the content on Warner Bros., HBO, and the HBO Max streaming service could soon be owned by Netflix. This also means that users may only need to stick to one platform, without having to switch between multiple apps and streaming services, and have all their favorite shows under one roof. They won't have to worry about licensing issues seen when some Warner Bros. shows move to other streaming services.</p><p>However, on the flip side, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix/netflixs-deal-with-warner-bros-sparks-debate-and-worry-over-content-quality">other concerns could be brewing</a>.

Samsung is reportedly working on a new smartwatch that is internally called the "Galaxy Watch 9 Ultra," but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-watch-ultra-2/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a> suggests this will hit shelves as the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2. However, the publication also suggests that the new Ultra won’t be released until the summer of 2026, meaning there will be no major rugged update in 2025.</p><p>Samsung appears to have delayed the launch, opting instead to focus on a more substantial upgrade in 2026. This move suggests the company is aiming for more than a mere specification bump, potentially giving the smartwatch a whole new look. We're likely to see a unique feature on the new watch.  If it shares the DNA of the Apple Watch 9, we’re likely to see more advanced health features and greater processing power.</p><h2 id="massive-one-ui-8-5-leak-2">Massive One UI 8.5 leak </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-review-hero-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 in blue on a blue table outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-update-changelog-leaked"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>We've been seeing multiple One UI 8.5 leaks lately, and this is the best one yet.

Although change often comes with some pushback, this particular deal has sparked widespread concern about the subscriber's position in the new streaming landscape.</p><p>Several users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1petx4m/breaking_netflix_acquires_warner_bros_in_83/">Reddit to share</a> their thoughts about the acquisition, and many comments were critical, focusing on the negative impact on the streaming experience and their wallets.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-XkNkAO"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/XkNkAO.js" async></script><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hckMS4oXmVWDfzhVqp9RFG" name="lg-oled-netflix-originals-1-wide.jpg" alt="LG OLED TV Netflix Originals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hckMS4oXmVWDfzhVqp9RFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Among the most common issues discussed were potential price hikes for the streaming service or for HBO's content becoming an "add-on" service for an extra charge, while keeping Netflix's prices intact. One user said, "$40 per month HBOflix incoming," while another said, "Def see another price increase coming soon.

While HBO's content may get a new home and possibly a larger viewership base, many users expressed concern, noting that Netflix will "screw up" the high-quality, prestige programming associated with HBO. Meanwhile, others pleaded with Netflix to "let HBO do its thing" and urged Netflix not to "touch HBO."</p><p>Speaking of content, one user was also concerned that there could be potential cancellation of existing shows and the "death of traditional film distribution," with some predicting "Rip movies. Rip theatrical releases. Rip theaters."

It features a wide camera lens, a telephoto, and an ultrawide lens on the rear, as well as a powerful front-facing camera.</p><p>The 10 Pro XL normally retails at $1,200, so keeping an eye out for deals like this is definitely the move. To be sure, this is also the lowest price ever recorded for the phone at Amazon, so it's not a bad pick if you're already in the market for something in the premium price range.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.00" data-dimension48="$1,199.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTPP3S7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-XL-render-Moonstone-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTPP3S7" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.00" data-dimension48="$1,199.00" data-dimension25=""><del><strong>$1,199.00</strong></del><strong> $849.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped $350 off the price of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, which is our top pick for the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phone for parents</a>.

The Google Tensor G5 also offers significant performance improvements over previous generations of the Pixel, making for smoother gaming. While it still doesn't quite hold up to some premium-level, Qualcomm-backed phones, it's still a welcome upgrade and it gets multi-tasking help from the 16GB of RAM.</p><p>As for cameras, this Pixel has a 50MP main lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro focus, a 48MP telephoto, and a 42MP selfie cam. It also comes with a 5,200mAh battery, 45W wired fast charging, and Qi2 Pixelsnap wireless magnets built in.</p><p>Some of the biggest downsides to the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL are its lack of a SIM card tray in the U.S., some battery throttling, and a PWM rate that isn't suitable for many with sensitive eyes. If these aren't dealbreakers for you, then an $850 price tag is a good opportunity to pick this premium phone up, at the very least.</p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-17">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The features build on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-now-remembers-your-drivers-license-passport-and-vehicle-info-so-you-dont-have-to">enhanced autofill</a>, the upgraded autofill feature that debuted in November for Chrome users in all regions and languages. Enhanced autofill initially added support for driver's license numbers, passport numbers, license plate numbers, and VINs.</p><p>Now, Google is expanding Chrome's enhanced autofill to support saving vehicle details to Google Wallet. This feature links your vehicle info to Google Wallet after entering it on a supported form in Chrome for desktop, making it available on any device signed into your Google account.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kn3xAshk8B7jpFrQxx5sFh" name="Chrome-Autofill-Holidays" alt="Chrome's enhanced autofill features being used to book flights and enter vehicle information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kn3xAshk8B7jpFrQxx5sFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chrome is gaining deeper integration with Google Wallet across the board to make securing holiday travel plans easier. The browser can pull information stored in your Wallet, like a confirmation or ticket number from your flight's boarding pass. Additionally, Chrome now has access to loyalty card info stored in Wallet on desktop and the Android app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zLuWkXTssYDr8vHVwq5kVh" name="Chrome-Autofill-Holiday-2" alt="Chrome's enhanced autofill features being used to book flights and enter vehicle information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLuWkXTssYDr8vHVwq5kVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Android version of the Chrome app is getting a major upgrade that'll make filling out forms a quicker process. The app is gaining a two-line view for autofill suggestions that make it clearer which autofill data you're entering before you tap it. For example, an address saved in autofill will now show the name and address in a two-line format. The same goes for passwords and payment methods, making it clearer which account or card you're using in the Chrome app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1076px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.63%;"><img id="GdnmErbTfPxDRErtm3brDY" name="image-5" alt="The new autofill form suggestions in Chrome for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdnmErbTfPxDRErtm3brDY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1076" height="1072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says this new autofill view for forms addresses an issue that made autofill suggestions appear too condensed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-just-got-its-long-awaited-dose-of-googles-latest-redesign">Chrome app for Android</a>.</p><p>Chrome will also work more closely with your Google Account to securely retrieve your name and email address as long as you're signed in. This also works for your home and work addresses, if they are saved to your Google Account. While autofill could previously fill these data types, the expanded support is helpful when using new devices. Users only need to sign into their account in Chrome to see all their information appear instantly.</p><p>Finally, for global users, Chrome is improving its understanding of address formats worldwide, like "between streets" in Mexico and phonetic names in Japan.</p><p>These improvements are rolling out now in Chrome for desktop and mobile, and they might just help save you time during the busy holiday season.</p> ]]></dc:content>
