The report mentions support for LOG recording and integrated LUT (Look-Up Table) profiles, giving users the ability to shoot flatter footage for easier color grading and then apply or preview different looks right on the device.</p><h2 id="extra-video-perks-2">Extra video perks</h2><p>A separate rumor from @UniverseIce on X hints that Samsung’s Gallery or Studio apps will allow these LUT previews, potentially cutting down on post-production work.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy S26 Series Strikes Back: APV Codec Challenges Apple's ProRes DominanceImagine shooting Hollywood-grade videos on your phone—vibrant colors, sharp details, lossless editing.

Early One UI 8.5 leaks point to flexible frame rates, with 1080p and 4K recording at 25, 50, or 100 fps, while 8K video looks capped at 25fps. None of this is confirmed yet, but it’s a strong sign that Samsung wants the S26 to double as a pro-level video rig.</p><h2 id="apple-in-the-crosshairs-2">Apple in the crosshairs</h2><p>Samsung’s play here is obviously to take on Apple’s ProRes video from the iPhone 17 Pro. With 12-bit color depth, HDR support (including HDR10 and HDR10+), and reports of about 20% better efficiency compared to HEVC or ProRes formats, APV could give Samsung an edge in both quality and storage management.</p><p>While there are still unknowns, like how Samsung will balance heat and battery drain during extended recording, the leaks suggest the S26 series could make pro-level shooting more accessible on Android.</p><p>If these capabilities make it into the final phones, the Galaxy S26 could be the lineup that finally challenges Apple’s dominance in mobile video.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It comes with ZAGG's EZ Apply installation tray, is made of highly durable Glass Elite tempered glass that's five times stronger than the industry standard, and has an oil-repelling layer on top. The edges of the Glass Elite Tablet Screen Protector are reinforced to prevent cracks from spreading, even if they do occur. The only problem with this kit is the $50 price tag.</p><p>So if you're on the hunt for something cheaper, the SPARIN 2 Pack Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 costs just $10 but includes two pieces of tempered glass screen protectors.

Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>Meta is continuing to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review#section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-specs-and-how-they-work">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2.</p><p>For those with advanced prescription needs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">there are third-party workarounds available</a>.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-design-and-specs-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Design and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-Black-glasses-on-display" alt="Black Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses sitting on a metal display shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content.</p><p>The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model.</p><p>I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1200p at 60FPS</p><p>1440p at 30FPS</p><p>3K at 30FPS</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>52g</p></td><td  ><p>49.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td><td  ><p>4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>48 hours worth of charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos.

Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses.</p><p>In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch.</p><p>You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI is becoming more robust</a>, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs.

The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get.</p><p>You should consider whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Display</a>, Oakley Meta HSTN, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses.</p><p>However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3ba678d4-1d84-40c6-8444-ed9ca77c890e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Drr6BvBvMgCFoowJyoiLHk.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses Wayfarer style with blue frames and blue lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to buy</strong></em></p><p>Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more.

It also tackles a known issue with color casts, so your photos now show truer, more balanced colors in any light.</p><p>AI SuperRes Zoom now makes zoomed-in text look crisper, and Action Mode cuts down noise and grain for cleaner motion shots. Even third-party camera apps are getting clearer results now. On the video side, contrast has been boosted, haze reduced, and colors look livelier, so clips should pop more on playback.</p><h2 id="under-the-hood-fixes-2">Under-the-hood fixes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing didn’t stop at camera polish. The update fixes a few annoying bugs and smooths out some rough edges across the interface.</p><p>The Glyph Matrix feature works better when you’re using multi-user mode alongside Always-on Glyph Toys, and a pesky bug that duplicated contact avatars when setting new Essential Notification rules has been squashed.</p><p>Haptic feedback is back to normal when previewing Generative notifications, and alignment issues with Arabic titles in the “About phone” section have been corrected. There’s also a cleaner interface for Bluetooth device recording tucked under Settings → Sound & Vibration → Bluetooth device recording.</p><p>On top of that, the update reduces heating and battery drain in certain scenarios, while Wi-Fi connectivity and overall network stability have been optimized.</p><p>Even though this build is still based on Android 15, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-0-revealed">recently teased its next big step</a>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-teases-refined-and-redefined-os-4-0-thats-coming-soon">Nothing OS 4.0 based on Android 16</a>. The update roadmap confirms that alongside the Phone 3, devices like the Phone 3a series, Phone 2 models, and CMF Phones will all get the upgrade.</p><p>For now, though, Phone 3 owners should head to Settings → Software Update and grab this release. Between the camera upgrades, performance fixes, and improved connectivity, it’s a worthwhile refresh ahead of the bigger changes to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The OpenFit 2 Plus brings back these same perks, largely unchanged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds, one facing the camera showing the logo and top button/speaker grill, the other laying on its back showing the main speaker grill, mic hole, and ear hook." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, however, the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus has enabled a Dolby Audio mode, in addition to the current options like bass boost. This mode cuts the battery life down from 11 hours to 9 hours, but in exchange, you get richer, more cinematic audio, best suited for streaming movies or shows but also improving your workout playlists.</p><p>While we've yet to test the Dolby Audio mode, our friends at Techradar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-headphones/i-went-for-a-run-with-the-all-new-shokz-openfit-2-and-theyre-already-threatening-to-become-my-go-to-running-headphones">reviewed the OpenFit 2+</a> and said that "everything becomes richer and more pronounced" with it toggled on, making the OpenFit 2 feel "obsolete" by comparison. We were impressed by the OpenFit 2's audio quality, which makes us excited to try this new mode.</p><p>In addition, the OpenFit 2 Plus comes with a Qi-compatible charging case, so you can leave your OpenFit 2s on a compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless charger</a> to refill its 48 hours of total capacity between workouts. USB-C charging currently refills the case and earbuds in about 100 minutes, but Shokz hasn't confirmed how long Qi charging will take.</p><p>Many recent wireless workout earbuds, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> and AirPods Pro 3, are using your ear canals to measure heart rate. It'll be interesting to see if this approach resonates with athletes, or if they'll prefer an option that leaves their ear canals open but still delivers Dolby-level sound.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus is available in Black, Grey, and Stone Blue through most retailers; limited-edition HYROX earbuds with a black and gold finish are only available through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openfit2plus">Shokz's site</a>, as part of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shokz-joins-hyrox-as-the-official-headphone-partner-of-hyrox-north-america-to-support-everyday-athletes-nationwide-302555665.html">official partnership</a> with the race series.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3a5c4ade-7f18-44b1-a5b1-524d76ff0cc2">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-Open-Ear-Headphones-Comfortable-Water-Resistant/dp/B0DYCJSZLS/" data-model-name="Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj8keyq5rW7qcvXmjNbzM6.png' alt="Render of the black Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus wireless earbuds and case"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2+ offer a unique alternative to bone conduction headphones, with rich, targeted audio, comfortably secure earhooks, dependable battery life, decent water resistance, and multipoint pairing to sync with both your phone and laptop. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, 6G is said to provide super low latency, meaning the time it takes for a signal to travel is expected to be reduced to microseconds, approximately a 1,000-fold improvement over 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH" name="6G- samsung-plans" alt="Samsung lays out what's in store with 6G connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/6g/6g-explained/#:~:text=A%20network%20that%20can%20sense,the%20environment%2C%20people%20and%20objects.">Nokia states</a> that the new network will have the ability to "sense" the environment by using signals that will essentially bounce off obstacles or objects that come in its path. This will allow it to figure out what those objects are, where they are, how fast they're moving, and what they're made of.</p><p>By combining this information with AI, the network can create a "digital twin" of the physical world. This will allow companies to create a map that will provide 6G signals to the user faster.</p><p>Finally, Verizon is also working with organizations like 3GPP, so that their research in 6G aligns with network standards worldwide. "This helps create a unified 6G network that everyone can use, no matter who made their device or where they are," it added.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To get us going, Google states this major update is rolling out for viewers with a TCL QM9K series device. Consumers with the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models will have to wait until "later this year."</p><p>This major Gemini for Google TV is calling the old (and still existing) Assistant old news, as the post states the newer AI model "goes beyond simple commands." Users can talk to Gemini with natural speech, as you would to a person sitting beside you. Saying "Hey Google" (or by pressing the mic button on your remote) will let you experience a new world of AI-assisted TV, such as when you're unsure about what to watch.</p><p>Google says users can ask Gemini to suggest some movies when it's hard to find something that two people with varying tastes may enjoy. If you like dramas, but your partner likes comedies, you can tell Gemini those interests and see what it finds.</p><p>Gemini can also get you "caught up" if you missed a season of a popular show, and it can even turn your "vague" show descriptions into something you can work with.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-asking-question-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a floating bar of text with a user's voice prompt in it, asking for the AI to explain a recent show's season for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-educational-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a text-based explainer for a child about "why volcanoes erupt," as well as offering a row of YouTube videos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini for Google TV is reportedly leaning into its educational abilities in this new update, and it's bringing YouTube with it. The company states that parents can ask Gemini to "explain" or expand on certain real-world phenomena. To explain, the post highlights that Gemini will deliver a text-based explainer, alongside a row of recommended YouTube videos to further the subject.</p><p>Moreover, Google teases that Gemini can also help you with tutorials and cooking ideas right from your TV.</p><p>As previously stated, Gemini for Google TV is rolling out today (Sep 22) for consumers with a TCL QM9K series device. The post alludes to there being even more Gemini capabilities "coming soon." We'll have to see if these additional features coincide with Gemini's release on more devices later in 2025.</p><h2 id="there-s-even-more-from-google-tv-on-the-way-2">There's even more from Google TV on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-free-live-tv-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Free Live TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We were hearing about this Gemini update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tvs-gemini-upgrade-promises-smarter-and-more-enjoyable-viewing-experience">Google TV during CES 2025</a>, which is when the company said you could just "speak naturally to your TV." That idea was stated alongside the idea that users wouldn't need to say "Hey Google." However, with today's update, we're seeing that the wake-up prompt is still there, but users can also press their microphone button and begin speaking.</p><p>Google stated that Gemini on Google TV would connect with a homeowner's smart devices, allowing the choice of checking in on doorbell cameras and more. This pretty much sounds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque update</a> we got a few months prior to CES 2025.</p><p>Google's current teaser of more Gemini features to come with its Google TV introduction was echoed in January. The company said that by the end of 2025, Google TV will feature proximity sensors that react to your presence, which could kick off a photo slideshow and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The design is thankfully unchanged, with Bose retaining the same aesthetic and build quality.</p><p>If anything, the biggest change this time has to do with the case; it has the same design as last time, but it now includes wireless charging as standard. This was a notable omission with the earlier model, and it's good to see Bose make amends. I was able to easily charge the case by plonking it down on the Qi 2 mat of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Baseus Nomos charging station</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5025" height="2830" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having used the QuietComfort Ultra extensively, the Gen 2 buds are immediately familiar. Bose sells the buds in four color choices — Black, White Smoke, Deep Plum, and Midnight Violet — and I'd suggest getting the violet model if you want a vibrant hue. I've got the White Smoke edition, and while the color is fine, it doesn't exactly stand out all that much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fit is identical to its predecessor, and the stabilizers that sit outside the shell ensure you get a tight seal while still being comfortable. Although these buds look a little bigger than their rivals, there are absolutely no issues with comfort, and the sound nozzle doesn't extend too much into the inner ear. You get a good range of accessories to tailor the fit, and there's no fatigue even with long-term use. In short, they're among the most comfortable earbuds around today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bundled ear tips include a filter by default, doing a better job protecting the shell.

Without knowing everything that was found and investigated, it's impossible to know how much of that is true, but it doesn't really matter because U.S. interests (public <em>and</em> private) would have just found another reason. Huawei needed to leave the market, and the faster the better.</p><p>It's about those little symbols at the top of your phone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">5G</a>. In the U.S., Huawei's phones weren't any better than others when it came to 5G connectivity, but Huawei makes more than phones. A lot more.</p><p>No, I don't mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-is-the-smartwatch-upgrade-you-need">watches</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mediapad-m5-hands">tablets</a>. I mean "heavy" network gear and switches that telecom companies need. In particular, Huawei was able to make network equipment that worked as well as anyone else could build and sell it cheaper. When that happened, companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/at-t-may-phase-out-huawei-equipment-network-upgrades-mexico#:~:text=AT&T%20will%20likely%20phase%20out,their%20networks%20outside%20the%20U.S." target="_blank">AT&T</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/ceo-hans-vestberg-says-verizon-does-not-use-any-huawei-equipment.html#:~:text=Verizon%20CEO:%20We're%20doing%20just%20fine%20without,from%20the%20Chinese%20trade%20war%2C%22%20says%20Vestberg" target="_blank">Verizon</a>, as well as more industrial companies we've never heard of, started to buy it.</p><p>The U.S. is weird when it comes to a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">monopoly</a>" in the market. Some politicians think one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/house-democrats-say-tech-companies-have-monopoly-needs-broken">should never exist,</a> some think only the companies they like should be able to dominate a market, but almost all of them feel that if there is going to be one, it can't be a company from China or with ties to the Chinese government.</p><p>Huawei is both, and the fears that it was state-sponsored before the ban may or may not have been true, but they are now. The very same thing would happen here in the U.S. if China banned a company with a high market share: the government would do whatever it takes to save it.</p><p>You can still buy a Huawei product in the U.S. from a reseller, but the hardware and the software are not going to work as designed, there will be no warranty, and it might not work at all. I'd advise against it.</p><h2 id="about-coming-back-2">About coming back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9" name="NVIDIA-GPU-Tech-Conf-2.jpg" alt="GPU Technology Conference sign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Huawei has thrived despite being banned in the U.S. The company still sells plenty of phones and other mobile products, but it's also a leader when it comes to (you guessed it) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/leashing-chinese-ai-needs-smart-chip-controls.html#:~:text=According%20to%20SemiAnalysis%2C%20Huawei's%20new,memory%20bandwidth%2C%20and%20integrated%20networking." target="_blank">AI</a>. If Huawei ever wanted to do business here or with American companies without restrictions, a lot would have to change.</p><p>I don't think Huawei would be willing (or should be willing) to step backwards so it can sell more phones in the land of rampant consumerism. It should continue to build out a portfolio of products, services, and mobile offerings without caring what the U.S. government thinks about it. With the company further entrenched with the Chinese government and having expanded into the field of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/huawei-shows-off-ai-computing-system-rival-nvidias-top-product-2025-07-26/">AI hardware</a>, technology, and research, everything the "right" people did not like about Huawei is now even "worse" than it was when the ban was placed.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the company striving to be an example of Chinese national pride, the same way Ford or General Motors once was in the U.S. Of course, I'm not privy to any information that would prove me wrong and have no say in the matter, so I'm going with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Clearly I was wrong, but if you (like me) were waiting for the right Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal to come along, now's your chance to grab the top-rated foldable at a much more reasonable price. </p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want a keyboard case, nothing works better than the Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover Keyboard Slim. However, it's also eye-wateringly expensive, priced at an ungodly $145. And if you skip the keyboard to cut costs, the basic Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover isn't any better. Without a keyboard, you'd still pay a whopping $90 for a mere tablet cover with a folio and stand.</p><p>Of course, Samsung's own cases work like a dream, hugging the Tab S11 in all the right places. However, at those prices, you're better off getting dupes that function almost as well as the first-party ones. Alternatively, you can turn to reliable name brands such as Spigen to get quality you can depend on. The Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S11 is rugged, affordable, and practical. With raised edges and several layers of material added to it for better drop-proofing, it is somewhat bulky, but you get ease of mind in exchange. The Spigen case also has a kickstand and an S Pen storage compartment.</p><p>If it's dupes you're interested in, the Doohoeek Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a cost effective keyboard case for the Tab S11. It has a backlit keyboard, scissor-switch keys, a low profile, a kickstand, and even an S Pen slot. If you want to go even cheaper, the HUKWIMO Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a budget-friendly buy without a keyboard. It imitates the three-fold design of the first-party Tab S11 Book Cover, so you can fold the cover to convert it into a stand in three different ways.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additional upgrades include better support for Now Bar apps and various security enhancements.</p><p>For now, the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6 is limited to South Korea, but Samsung should be rolling it out in other markets soon.

This potential feature is presumably designed to limit how much of your screen can be seen from side angles.</p><p>The idea is simple but smart: if you’re on a bus or standing in a crowded line, the person next to you shouldn’t get an eyeful of your banking details or private chats.</p><p>According to the leaked code strings, Private Display isn’t just a manual toggle. Samsung is baking in some intelligence here. The feature can reportedly kick in automatically when you’re using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place.</p><p>There also seem to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control. Users might even be able to pick specific apps to trigger the feature or schedule when it turns on.</p><h2 id="new-hardware-needed-2">New hardware needed</h2><p>What makes this particularly exciting is that it likely ties into new hardware. Samsung’s display division has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank">been developing “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a>, an AI-driven pixel adjustment that changes viewing angles. However, this tech is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1957681630509953114" target="_blank">rumored</a> to be compatible only with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and probably future Ultra models.</p><p>That means Private Display won’t be coming to every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. Without the right panel tech, older models probably won’t be able to pull this off.</p><p>Timing-wise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> has already started rolling out to some devices, but One UI 8.5 is expected to make its official debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series in early 2026. Samsung could still tweak or delay some parts of Private Display before launch, but what’s already been uncovered shows a lot of promise.</p><p>Instead of forcing users to rely on clunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party screen protectors</a>, Samsung looks ready to build smarter, more seamless privacy directly into its hardware and software. For anyone who hates shoulder surfers, this should be a meaningful upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company is quick to acknowledge that its AI isn't perfect.

Parents are getting pulled in, too. Starting today, Instagram will send notifications to parents in Canada with conversation tips, developed with pediatric psychologist Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, on how to talk with their teens about using their real birthdays online.</p><p>Instagram's message is clear: if teens list the right ages, the system can protect them better.</p><p>The company says more than 54 million teens worldwide are already in Teen Accounts, and 97% of 13 to 15-year-olds have kept the protections on. Over 90% of surveyed parents think the safeguards help, but many still feel overwhelmed by managing their kids’ online lives. By nudging parents directly and backing them up with AI, Instagram is hoping to close the gap.</p><p>The platform admits age verification online is still an industry-wide headache. Even with AI and parental involvement, misrepresentation happens. Still, by linking parental approval and app store age checks with its own tech, Instagram is trying to make it harder for underage users to slip through the cracks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We got to go hands-on with all of them, and I've used several pairs since 2021.</p><p>Despite coming out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, Meta isn't sunsetting the Gen 1s at all. In fact, the company is keeping them around as the most affordable entry in the lineup, with the price scaling up from there. In total, Meta has half a dozen different smart glasses to choose from.</p><p>So which pair of Meta smart glasses is right for you? They all have Meta AI at their core and can take pictures, record video, and mirror earbud functionality when paired with any phone, but is the least expensive pair your best bet? Or should you get something a little more premium? I answer all those questions and more below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-1"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC" name="Ray-Ban-Stories-2023-recording-LED-02.jpg" alt="The status LED on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite what the name says, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) is actually the second-generation Ray-Ban smart glasses product. The original was called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> and debuted in September 2021, but the rebrand to Ray-Ban Meta for the second product was for a big reason. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was a superb upgrade, offering Meta AI capabilities, significantly better video and picture quality, surround sound audio recording and playback, and better battery life.</p><p>Despite Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) being the cheapest of the bunch, they're still a wonderful pair of smart glasses that I think most people will be happy with. They come in three classic Ray-Ban styles — Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler — each with a wide selection of lens colors and tints. And yes, you can even get prescription lenses from -6.00 to +4.00.</p><p>But Meta doesn't seem to be stocking all available lens colors for the Gen 1s anymore. As of this writing, Meta only offers Wayfarer and Skyler on its website, and Best Buy has a very limited selection, as well.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, 3 colors per style. High and low bridge options. Large or small size (Wayfarer-only).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lens options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Clear, solid tint, Transitions, prescription (-6.00 to +4.00)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 4 hours per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, 1080p 30FPS video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>76.1dB dual speakers, 5 mics</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Additional features</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Meta AI with camera and microphone access, video livestreaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Starts at $299</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) supports most of the same Meta AI features of newer Meta smart glasses, with a few notable exceptions. While you can ask Meta what it sees or hears, it can only process a single audio cue at a time. This means you'll need to ask questions one at a time, while newer Meta glasses support Meta AI live conversation mode.</p><p>The Gen 1's camera quality is also almost as good as the Gen 2's, despite the gulf in resolution offered in recording quality. Pictures are largely identical between generations, but video quality is significantly better on Gen 2s. Gen 1 also has worse video stabilization.</p><p>Battery life is the weakest part of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1). At just 4 hours of maximum battery life per charge, you'll be used to charging these glasses at least once per day. Thankfully, the included charging case makes it easy to top them up on the go, and you'll be able to charge the glasses fully several times over before needing to recharge the case.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d59d18c0-33e3-457a-955e-c4cd86282e55">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtHvnQ6maDDrxzE4uEUDng.jpg' alt="Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses official product renders"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Style on a budget</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) packs in excellent speakers and mics, classic Ray-Ban styles, respectably high-res photos, compatibility with Facebook and Instagram for quick sharing, and other perks that make them among the best smart glasses available.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-2"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the most stylish pair of smart glasses Meta offers today. With over 150 different lens, frame, color, and style combinations, there's almost certainly a pair that'll fit you as an individual.</p><p>It's also a palpable upgrade for some of the lowest-ranking parts of Gen 1. It nearly doubles the battery life, which was the biggest complaint about the Gen 1 glasses. These run the same internal hardware and cameras as Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">my battery tests there</a> will give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>TLDR, Gen 2s should take around 60% more photos and video on a single charge than Gen 1s, and that's reason enough to choose them for anyone who wants these for their unique perspective.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, up to 6 colors per style.

See this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/sBL0acIBb2Y">Oakley Meta HSTN running test</a> video for an idea of what you can expect to see from Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2).</p><p>In addition to the battery and camera upgrades, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) also adds Meta AI Live conversation mode. When you say, "Hey Meta, go live," the AI will enter conversation mode and be able to see and hear what you see in real-time.</p><p>This is an upgrade over the previous Meta AI functionality on Gen 1 glasses, as you can walk around and have a flowing conversation with Meta AI.

The fit is more snug than Ray-Ban Metas and has a straighter temple design, while Ray-Bans have a curved temple tip that holds on to your ears better.</p><p>If I had to pick one reason to choose Oakley Meta HSTN over Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), it would be for the PRIZM lenses. These specialized polarized lenses offer an extra vibrant color palette for the world while simultaneously blocking harmful UV rays.

Up until now, Meta's glasses were iterations of one another, but Vanguard is where the experience forks a bit. These glasses are made for athletes who plan to record their activities with a more convenient hands-free camera instead of strapping a GoPro to a helmet.</p><p>As such, they have a limited number of style options, don't support prescription lenses, and only come with Oakley PRIZM lenses. You can easily swap out lens colors if you want to buy additional ones, but there's no support for Transitions, polarized, solid color, or clear lenses at this time.</p><p>But what they lack in style, they more than make up for in capability. Oakley Meta Vanguard are the first Meta smart glasses that tie directly into Garmin and Strava, automatically matching up recorded videos with fitness data from these services.

They may look like a thicker version of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer AI glasses, but there's so much more to them, starting with the lenses.</p><p>All Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses come with Transitions lenses as a standard, so you can wear them inside and out all day long. The 6-hour battery life ensures that you can get plenty done before needing to charge, and the handy folding charging case fits in a bag or pocket, making it more convenient than other glasses on this page.</p><p>A transparent display sits inside the right lens, illuminating when needed to show you notifications, apps, and even a camera viewfinder.

The specialized electronics inside understand how human arm and hand muscles work and are used to control the glasses without a controller, touch, or even a camera to see them.</p><p>With this, you can respond to messages by writing on a table (as if you were holding a pen), turn the music volume up and down by rotating an invisible dial, and even flick through Instagram discretely using your thumb.

This simple gadget tracked steps and sleep, and even had a vibration motor inside to alert you to phone notifications. Since then, Amazfit has morphed into a fitness powerhouse, offering dozens of different smartwatches at every price level and functionality you could dream of.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions">Amazfit Balance 2</a> is my favorite smartwatch from the company in a long time, and its impressive capabilities are only matched by its sleek appearance. Of course, my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> is still cranking right along, good as the day it came out, and is, quite frankly, hard to beat for most fitness-related tasks.</p><p>I wore both of these watches on my latest Spartan Race and had a difficult time finding any reasonable differences in the data they provided at the end of the race. Which leads me to wonder: why would I pay more for a Garmin than an Amazfit watch? I found a few reasons, and they might help you decide.</p><h2 id="price-2">Price</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg" name="amazfit-balance-2-and-t-rex-3-pro" alt="Holding an Amazfit Balance 2 and Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Price is the area where Amazfit wins most handily. Garmin is known for producing high-quality watches that aren't inexpensive, which has given the brand a premium image over the years. Amazfit started from the other end of things, offering dirt-cheap products and upping their game over time (but still undercutting rivals on price).</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-vs-garmin-vivosmart-5">Amazfit Band 7 vs the Garmin Vivosmart 5</a>, for instance. Both of these are the latest fitness bands with displays from each respective company; yet, Garmin's is still three times the price of Amazfit's. Plus, because of software updates and a fresh Zepp app, some of the shortcomings we found in our original Amazfit Band 7 review have been rectified.</p><p>This same argument can be made for many of Amazfit's products. In many cases, competing Amazfit products offer 90-95% of the features of Garmin's at something like half the price, and that's a ratio I'm willing to work with.</p><h2 id="fitness-tracking-2">Fitness tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5" name="amazfit-balance-2-garmin-instinct-2x-solar-spartan-race" alt="Wearing an Amazfit Balance 2 and a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar smartwatch at a Spartan Race" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Amazfit watches felt like an obvious second-rate choice for fitness tracking. While they have offered more options for workout types — 180 on the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro I just got versus around 90 on the Garmin Instinct 2X I have — I wasn't convinced of the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring until this year's products.</p><p>Both the Amazfit Balance 2 and T-Rex 3 Pro have superb heart rate accuracy, matching all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a> I've tested to date. I've taken these watches out for paddleboarding sessions, run a Spartan Race with them, and spent plenty of time in my CrossFit-style gym trying out everything from cardio days to strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD" name="Garmin-marathon-training-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on the author's wrist, showing the Primary Race widget with the Garmin Tucson Marathon time, date, weeks until the event, and goal time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only area I found where Garmin more consistently has the edge over Amazfit is during strength training and weight-lifting exercises. While several Amazfit workout types will give you a breakdown of what muscles you used and keep track of your reps, Garmin more consistently shows the correct workout type automatically.</p><p>For instance, my most common workout type is HIIT since it most closely aligns with my gym's typical activity types. If I look at the data from my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, it's got muscle heatmaps of what it thinks I used, which is helpful for going back and remembering why my shoulders are suddenly sore two days later.</p><p>Amazfit only offers this kind of muscular heatmap for strength training or weightlifting exercise types. I've also found that Amazfit's watches have a harder time differentiating nuanced workouts than Garmin. If I select strength training and do a bunch of front squats with a barbell, Garmin almost always marks it as "barbell squat," while Amazfit's watches might figure that out 30% of the time.</p><h2 id="companion-apps-and-syncing-2">Companion apps and syncing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao" name="garmin-connect-spartan-race-map" alt="A map of a Spartan Race workout in the Garmin Connect app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get a little mixed. As an app, Amazfit Zepp is superior. It's got a better, less convoluted UI when compared to the Garmin Connect app, and it offers a ton of additional features that Garmin just doesn't have. LLM-powered food logging is probably the greatest single feature I've used in <em>any</em> holistic workout app, and it's something only Zepp has.</p><p>But as good as the Zepp app's features and UI are, it's held back by a number of bugs that are just plain frustrating. Reddit users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazfit/comments/1khsh4r/amazfit_trex_3_and_active_2_serious_bugs_still/">have complained</a> about this many times, and it often takes Amazfit a long time to address these problems. Coding and workout algorithms are hard, no doubt, but it seems like Amazfit's team isn't able to crank out fixes as fast as some other companies.</p><p>I don't often run into problems with the app, but my original intent for this week's column was to compare data from the Spartan Race I just ran. The problem is, the Amazfit watch had my entire workout on it, but the Zepp app simply wouldn't sync the entire thing.</p><p>This left me with missing workout data when I exported the workout to quantified-self.io, the service we typically use to directly compare smartwatch fitness data. Unfortunately for my original idea, the entire stack of GPS data was missing, and the Zepp app confirmed that.</p><h2 id="holding-amazfit-back-2">Holding Amazfit back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-02" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that there's no way to manually sync fitness data from Amazfit watches or even export from the watch itself.

When Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab S11, it confirmed the flagship supports 5G, but only sub-6 networks, and there is no support for mmWave 5G networks. You'll of course need a carrier connection and plan to use it. It's also worth noting that while Samsung says the Tab S11 supports 5G, there's currently no 5G variant available for purchase in the U.S., though it is offered in other global markets.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s-5g-connectivity-2">Everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Tab S11's 5G connectivity</h2><p>Like clockwork, Samsung has unveiled its next generation of flagship Android tablets. At this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a>, the company introduced the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This time, Samsung has dropped the Plus model in favor of the standard 11-inch Tab S11. The new Galaxy Tab S11 lineup brings thinner builds, upgraded internals, and One UI 8 (based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box.</p><p>Similar to last year's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra, Samsung has kept 5G connectivity in the Tab S11 series. Both Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra are available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + 5G variants globally. This means you can use Wi-Fi for streaming, downloading apps, and gaming, or get the 5G variant to stay connected on the go without relying on a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Of course, to enjoy 5G on the go, you'll need a separate line or connection for the tablet. Samsung notes that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support physical SIM cards — unlike some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 that have gone eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. Optionally, you can also configure an eSIM alongside a physical SIM.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for 5G support, the Galaxy Tab S11 does support 5G out of the box, giving you fast speeds for streaming and downloads. However, Samsung specifies that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support only sub-6 5G networks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-sub-6-better-mmwave-immediate-5g-future">Sub-6 5G</a> means the Tab S11 can connect to networks below 6GHz, offering wider coverage and better penetration. However, speeds are lower than mmWave 5G. It's worth noting that last year's Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">Tab S10+ offered mmWave 5G</a> support, but this year, Samsung has kept it consistent across the board, with both Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra only offering Sub-6 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another thing to note here is that while Samsung says the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support 5G globally, as of writing, 5G models do not appear to be available for direct purchase on Samsung's USA website. For now, only Wi-Fi models are available in the U.S., with no official word on whether Samsung plans to bring the 5G models to the States.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you don't wish to spend extra to get 5G or if it's not available in your region, you can always use Wi-Fi to get Internet access on your tablet, whether that's using your home's Wi-Fi network or converting your smartphone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 FE</a> or OnePlus 13R, into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-wi-fi-hotspot-android-phone">portable hotspot</a>.

Tempered glass with 9H hardness is the industry standard. Meanwhile, plastic can be TPU, PET, or even hybrid in nature. None of them is right or wrong; it just depends on your usage.</p><p>For most people, the best Samsung Galaxy S25 FE screen protector is one made of tempered glass. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE Screen Protector 2 Pack is the best overall pick for anyone. This kit includes two pieces of hardy 9H tempered glass screen protectors and camera lens protectors. The lens protectors are made of the same durable glass, but they are dark, which might put some folks off. This set also includes a highly convenient alignment frame that reduces the installation time to barely a minute or two.</p><p>If you want a screen protector set that comes with a clear camera lens protector, the firtstnow 3 Pack Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is better suited for you. While it's not as highly reputed as amFilm, it does have outstanding reviews online. You get three 9H tempered glass screen and lens protectors each. However, there's no installation frame in the box.</p><p>After you're done shopping for shatter-proof and scratch-resistant screen protectors, be sure to grab a shock-, impact-, and drop-resistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cases">phone case for your Galaxy S25 FE</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A decent magnetic grip can easily prevent falls and relieve your fingers of repeated stress from holding your phone too long and too frequently. The best part of a magnetic grip is that there's no sticky adhesive — you can pop the grip on and off at any given time.</p><p>The Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand is the best official Pixelsnap-certified accessory for the Pixel 10. It's affordable, functional, and lightweight. You don't need much from a ring holder for your phone to begin with. It's meant to act as a grip and a stand, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand does both well. If you prefer a more traditional circular phone grip, the PopSockets MagSafe PopGrip in Enamel is a great alternative.</p><p>After you've chosen a decent magnetic phone grip, the next Qi2 accessory to look for is a wireless charger. The Anker MagGo 15W Qi2 Wireless Charger (2-in-1 Stand) also doubles as a phone holder that has a magnetic mount with highly adjustable tilting. You can wirelessly charge your Pixel 10 and prop it up at a comfortable viewing angle at the same time. It's priced very reasonably, too.</p><h2 id="convert-your-pixel-10-into-a-mobile-photography-or-videography-rig-2">Convert your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-qi2-kraftgeek-justtap-powershutter-mous-qi2-wireless-charging-stand-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro with several magnetic accessories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6778" height="3813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3" name="google-pixel-10-pro-kraftgeek-powershutter-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro using the KraftGeek PowerShutter magnetic accessory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3680" height="2070" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah" name="Mous-Charging-Stand-with-Qi2-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro on a magnetic Mous Charging Stand with Qi2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3643" height="2049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Converting your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig might sound expensive and intimidating, but Qi2 greatly simplifies things. I have used countless gimbals, tripods, and phone stands over the years, and I hate fumbling with the adjustable arms the most. Clamping your phone into a traditional stand or tripod is super annoying, especially when your phone case is on the thicker side. Luckily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod</a> has a magnetic mount.</p><p>The JustTap Tripod is an ingenious way to make the most of your Google Pixel 10's magnetic prowess. All you have to do is slap your phone onto the magnetic mount and set the tripod up — which, by the way, also takes a few short seconds thanks to the "tap to unfold" base mechanism. This tripod is also unbelievably compact and lightweight, with a level of stability and sturdiness that you would not expect from something this light. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> was very happy atop the magnetic mount, even when I moved the tripod around, adjusted its height, and tested it for sturdiness with jerky movements.</p><p>I highly recommend getting a magnetic light for your Google Pixel 10's cameras. The Ulanzi LM19 Selfie Ring Light has several levels of brightness and temperature adjustability. It's highly compact and charges via USB-C, and you can tilt it thanks to the way it is built. It's a fantastic tool to boost your Pixel 10's photography game.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's the most compact out of the top options from Apple, Samsung, and Google, and it added a third rear camera before it was cool. Now, it's time to see whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a> can beat the Galaxy S25 at its own game in base-model value.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> are both small flagships, but Apple's smartphone is heavier and less compact than Samsung's. It comes down to the displays — Samsung is still using a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25, whereas Apple moved to a larger 6.3-inch screen. Both are now capable of hitting 120Hz refresh rates, and have AOD options.</p><p>Apple is using Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the iPhone 17, and Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the Galaxy S25. Both are made by Corning, but the key difference is that the iPhone 17's cover glass is optimized for scratch protection and has anti-reflective properties. To get an anti-reflective screen on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you have to go with the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to understate the difference in size between the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25. By just comparing the screen sizes, the gap looks minuscule, but there's more to the story. The iPhone measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm and weighs 177 grams, which is larger by every measure compared to the Galaxy S25's dimensions of 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm. The Samsung base model's weight is particularly impressive at just 162 grams — even lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/exclusive-apples-big-bet-and-its-not-the-iphone-air">iPhone Air</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Galaxy S25 packs flagship specs and a larger battery capacity than the iPhone 17 in that small form factor. The only key compromise here is the display, which is smaller by one tenth of an inch. Only you can decide whether the bigger, thicker, and heavier design of the iPhone 17 is a dealbreaker, but I prefer the compact and lightweight build of the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for durability, both phones sport an IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.

It's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> mobile platform, the same one that powers Samsung's most expensive handsets. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 runs on an Apple A19 chip that's a lower-tier offering compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 Pro</a> in the Air and Pro models. This could help the Galaxy S25 excel in AI tasks and gaming, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Samsung has the advantage in on-device memory, with 12GB of RAM on the Galaxy S25 compared to the iPhone 17's 8GB. However, the iPhone 17 crucially starts with 256GB of base storage at the same price as the 128GB Galaxy S25. There's more storage available on the higher-end configurations, too. You can buy an iPhone 17 with up to 512GB of storage, while the Galaxy S25 tops out at 256GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.8 main sensor + 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view + 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto with 3x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow (Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold only at Samsung)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of connectivity, the iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S25 both support Wi-Fi 7, 5G, satellite connectivity, and NFC.

The practical benefit of this change is being able to take selfies in either orientation, portrait or landscape, without having to physically rotate your phone. And when there's a big group shot, Center Stage uses AI to automatically expand the view to fit everyone in.</p><p>The rear cameras are a bit less exciting — they're 48MP sensors, a main and an ultrawide.

However, both also stand out in their own way. Aside from the obvious iOS 26 vs. One UI 7 debate, these phones focus on completely different things.</p><p>The iPhone 17 clearly puts an emphasis on the cameras, making it a great option for creators or anyone who loves to take photos or videos. Yes, it has one fewer rear camera than the Galaxy S25, but its 48MP main and ultrawide cameras are top-notch. Plus, the square front-facing camera that makes it possible to capture vertical or horizontal selfies without rotating your device is a standout feature.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 has more raw power with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and it does more with it thanks to Galaxy AI and Gemini. It'll run circles around Apple Intelligence, and the smarts may even help the phone beat the iPhone 17 in gaming and intensive tasks.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either one, but if you happen to care about camera or AI features, you may want to pick the iPhone 17 or Galaxy S25, respectively.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8700225f-d3fb-405c-b2a6-5f513ad68d58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For the cameras</strong></em></p><p>Android users might notice that the iPhone 17 stands out as a camera-focused flagship.

And while I haven't jumped on the smart glasses train just yet, the new offerings from Meta have me really excited about this growing category.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is rumored to have its own AI glasses in the works, which could launch as soon as October alongside the more powerful Project Moohan XR headset. These have a lot of potential, especially as the first real competitors to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). However, with the latest generation being Meta's third attempt at smart glasses, Samsung and Google will have to play catch-up on both hardware and software to make up for lost time.</p><h2 id="all-the-right-upgrades-2">All the right upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen 2-Shiny-Cosmic-Blue-Transitions" alt="The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's only been the last few years that smart glasses started taking off, and that's largely thanks to Meta. In 2021, it seemed a little strange that Meta was diving into this unproven market, but the popularity of the last-gen Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses proved that this is a winning category for the company.</p><p>Admittedly, Meta's last-gen model was the first time I was even remotely interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. I was impressed with how they're able to identify what was in front of me while looking like something anyone could wear, unlike the early attempts of Google Glass.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were some downsides to the glasses, with the main thing being battery life. This was admittedly the biggest reason why I hadn't pulled the trigger on buying them, but Gen 2 fortunately appears to have addressed this.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-03" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is estimated to last up to eight hours on a single charge with mixed use. This feels perfectly sufficient for something like these, which I likely won't be using constantly aside from the occasional question, listening to music, and taking a photo or video here and there.</p><p>Meta also upped the video capture capabilities to a 3K resolution. As someone who loves to capture videos to post on my Instagram stories or Reels, this is a great upgrade. I'll likely stick to 1080p, because frankly, I don't think anything beyond that is necessary for social media, but having the option is nice.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-smart-glasses-could-be-just-as-compelling-2">Samsung's smart glasses could be just as compelling</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-vs-google-smart-glasses-sameer-teaser" alt="Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses with a picture of Android Central's Nick Sutrich wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screen captures from The Android Show I/O Edition 2025)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've heard and seen a lot regarding Samsung's Project Moohan and Google's Android XR ambitions, but we haven't heard as much about Samsung's rumored Ray-Ban Meta competitors. It has been reported that the glasses, dubbed Project Haean, could launch with the aptly named "Samsung Galaxy Glasses" moniker and would be audio-only, featuring a camera and quick access to AI assistants.</p><p>This already sounds quite compelling to me, as Samsung has put much of its focus lately on Gemini, which is becoming a staple in my life. Gemini's more natural conversational skills, as well as features like Gemini Live, which can easily identify what it sees and even remember things for you, would fit extremely well on a pair of smart glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M" name="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" alt="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1578" height="888" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This could also give the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) a run for its money, as Samsung and Google have the ecosystem to back up Gemini's capabilities. On the one hand, Meta's services have become fairly ubiquitous, with apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp installed on hundreds of millions of smartphones, not to mention Meta AI injected into these apps (whether we like it or not). This, along with the growing popularity of Meta's glasses, gives it a good amount of mindshare among consumers.</p><p>On the other hand, Google and Samsung have been pushing Gemini's capabilities on their phones and other devices. Look at any Pixel 10 commercial and you'll see how the focus is less on the phone and more on what Gemini can do for you in your everyday life. This type of marketing is admittedly quite effective, and I imagine this would translate extremely well with Android XR glasses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>There's also the fact that these glasses would likely have a deeper connection with Android phones than Meta's do, which is another differentiating factor that could play in Samsung's favor. Imagine getting real-time Maps directions, creating new events in Calendar, or translating a conversation with Google Translate, all without taking out your phone.</p><p>Hands-free access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps">your favorite Google apps</a> could be a huge draw over Meta.</p><h2 id="another-galaxy-ring-situation-2">Another Galaxy Ring situation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7" name="google-glasses-ted-2025-demo-nishtha-shatia-02" alt="Samsung Project HAEAN Android XR glasses being shown off at TED 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gilberto Tadday / TED)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Samsung wants its "Galaxy Glasses" to succeed, it's going to have to do more than rely on its name to generate sales. We're seeing Samsung dive into new product categories lately with devices like the Galaxy Ring, and while it was a valiant effort to supplant a growing market, it's still an expensive product that feels a bit like an also-ran to the Oura Ring.</p><p>Samsung will have to create a rather compelling case for why people should buy smart glasses <em>and </em>why they should choose it over Meta. For that to happen, Samsung will have to get three things right:</p><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: They can't <em>look </em>like smart glasses if they expect people to wear them. They should also have multiple styles/colors.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: Samsung hasn't always excelled in this spec, and it will have to really squeeze as much battery as it can to make them useful.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: If they're too expensive, Samsung might as well throw in the towel to Meta.</li></ul><p>Availability is also a concern. Rumors point to a reveal of the Galaxy Glasses in October, while some indications point to a 2026 launch, which could mean even more time for Meta's glasses to hold the spotlight.</p><p>On the plus side, Google's work on Gemini has put it in a good place for integrating into smart glasses, meaning the glasses should be plenty capable. If Samsung can nail everything else above, it could properly challenge Meta's growing lineup of AI glasses and push the market further into the mainstream.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Unfortunately, that means Gemini won't be able to leak the Colonel's famous fried chicken recipe or anything else that's important.</p><p>It's coming to mobile users, too. Google says nothing about the mobile and desktop versions being different, so I'm going to assume the same features will be available on your phone, too. And yes, that means Gemini will be built into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-me-crazy-i-prefer-ios-google-chrome-app-androids">Chrome for iOS</a>, "soon", too.</p><p>Now for the part nobody likes: <strong>This is only for users in the United States who have their devices set with English as the default language</strong>. I can understand the need to test it and see what regulators think about it, but that doesn't help anyone who wants to try it and isn't eligible. It's not like there are almost a  billion users in India and Brazil, or anything, right, Google?</p><p>Having said all that, there is one thing missing from everything Google had to say: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. I know Chromebooks already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Gemini integration</a>, so maybe this will "just work" once it comes to your account. The company makes no mention of any changes for Chromebooks or Chrome OS.</p><h2 id="i-m-surprised-2">I'm surprised</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo" name="surprise5.jpg" alt="Surprise" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>I figured something like this would be coming once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-googles-big-court-win-mean-for-us">all the courtroom dust over Chrome was settled</a>. Chrome and Search are tied together in a really deep way, and that's why web browser market share is so important to Google.</p><p>What surprised me is (what feels like) the restraint Google has shown by not throwing the AI kitchen sink into Chrome and making everyone hate it. These features all seem... reasonable. I won't use all of them, but there are several I can see myself using every day, as I do 100% of my work in the Chrome browser. Is it enough to make me want to switch my "personal time" web browser from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> to Chrome? It could be.</p><p>What's most important is that it won't make things worse. Nothing pops up automatically, nothing seems too intrusive or invasive, and Gemini is getting better, whether we want to admit it or not. I'm actually looking forward to this.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But each one has its strengths and weaknesses, so I'll help you pick the best XR glasses option for you.

This model is slim and modern, with a vibrant 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED display and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus back panel, all protected by an IP67 water/dust resistance rating.</p><p>The phone also sports a versatile triple-camera system with a 50MP primary lens, and there's a reliable 5,000mAh battery that should easily clear two days on a single charge.</p><p>For performance, you're getting the still-solid Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, which is a bit on the older side but still performs quite well in most use cases. Wrap it all up with six years of OS and security updates and you're looking at a pretty exceptional experience for the price.</p><p>Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> generally come with a few sacrifices, and the Samsung Galaxy A36 is no exception. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset might lag a bit if you do a lot of gaming or streaming on your phone, and you're only getting 128GB of base storage (with no ability to expand via microSD). The Galaxy A36 5G also ditches the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is one feature that previously helped Samsung's A series stand out from the crowd.</p><p>With that being said, the Galaxy A36 may not be a powerhouse, but it's a solid phone that's simply <em>good at being a phone. </em>No bells and whistles, just sturdy construction and performance where it counts. Pair this device with one of those excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> from Total Wireless and you're setting yourself up for success this fall.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The user's photos show that Google is seemingly testing a small change to the menu presented when clicking on your profile icon on your TV homescreen. The user snapped a photo of Google TV's alert, stating that it's moved "your Library and Watchlist to under the profile icon."</p><p>Now, both those options are there, alongside the pre-existing "Your Services" and "Content Preferences," with the account switcher and add account icons above them.</p><p>Outside of the profile menu, Google TV's redesign in testing also revamped the navigational bar. Again, the company highlights this change, stating, "Search is now here, and we've renamed For You to Home." Google has housed these options within a pill-shaped bar with "Live" and "Apps" in there, too. However, as the publication also notes, Google TV has separated the settings menu and the screensaver option into their own pill-shaped menu next to your main content hub selection.</p><p>It's been reported that this small <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Google TV</a> homescreen redesign hit the user's device in v1.0.806977084. It's not uncommon for Google's tests to be limited, meaning only a few users ever see them at the start. It looks like that's what we're dealing with again, probably to give Google time to make any more changes (if there are any) and to receive feedback from those who got it unexpectedly.</p><h2 id="a-little-tlc-for-google-tv-2">A little TLC for Google TV</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.52%;"><img id="TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5" name="google-tv-homescreen-navigation-redesign-reported" alt="Google TV is supposedly testing a redesign that alters its navigational bar, including Search and changing "For You" to "Home."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1009" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.26%;"><img id="bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5" name="google-tv-profile-icon-menu-buttons-moved" alt="Google TV is reportedly testing a redesign to the profile icon menu, bringing in the Wishlist and Library options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1016" height="531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google TV is kept relatively tame in terms of updates and things to get excited for; however, we did have that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque</a> update to stare at.

Initially, rumors suggested that Samsung could launch its XR headset along with its trifold device on Sept. 29 and open sales in October. The date seems to have been adjusted to "coordinate internal marketing strategies and ensure completeness," the publication added.</p><p>There have been conflicting reports about when Samsung could launch the trifold; some suggest that it could show up with the XR headset, while this report states that it will be unveiled at a separate event in November. We may not have a date pinned down, but Samsung is reportedly going to launch the trifold device in the U.S. simultaneously with South Korea.

The most exciting announcement was the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,</a> which are its first to feature a display built into the lens, fully powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta's AI</a>, and also come with a Meta Neural Band that uses hand gestures to help you make calls, type texts, and even take pictures on the go. This allows for seamless, hands-free interaction with the glasses.</p><p>Meta also released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-launch">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, an updated version of its popular glasses, featuring twice the battery life and a 3K camera. Users can expect double the battery life, meaning the frames can last up to eight hours with "typical" use and charge to 50% in ~20 minutes.</p><p>Meta even ventured into a pair of glasses that are exclusively for outdoor enthusiasts, craving adventure, or even sports enthusiasts. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> glasses feature a 12MP wide-angle camera that captures up to 3K resolution, along with Slow Motion, Hyperlapse, and adjustable stabilization for smooth action shots.

The earbuds come in black or white colorways, both of which feature a transparent design and an aluminum and plastic case.</p><p>Speaking of the case, it has a built-in dual-microphone system with a dedicated "Talk" button. This "Super Mic" makes calls clear even in very loud places. All you have to do is press the button, and the audio input switches from the buds to the case, and the case transforms into a mic. Pretty handy for when you need to record reels for Instagram/TikTok or if you need to record a quick voice note.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Nothing Ear 3</a> also gets upgraded sound quality, featuring a larger 12mm dynamic driver, up from the Ear 2, which will supposedly increase the bass to 6 dB and up to a 4 dB improvement in treble.

This seems to be shaping up as an essential update showing beta users more than just a gist of what they can expect in December's Pixel feature drop.</p><p>Considering the software is in the "later-stage" beta, it brings with it new features as well as security updates. The one feature that really stands out is the ability to customize icon shapes — neat, right? It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen, and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match your preference. You can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><p>Another feature that's customer-facing is for the fitness enthusiasts; this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives users the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors, and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  The beta also introduces enhanced security features for both developers and users.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Windows users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">can sign up</a> and begin testing "Google app for Windows." According to the post, Windows users can quickly "search without switching windows or interrupting your flow" by pressing the key combo Alt+Space. Users will receive the classic rounded corner Google Search bar with a convenient Lens icon on the far-right side.</p><p>The Lens icon lets users run a search using the content on their screen, which will provide image and text translations, too.</p><p>The company goes a bit further in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">its Search Labs page </a>for the test. It explains that users can run web searches with the Google app for Windows and run searches through their Drive files, installed apps, and download files. AI Overviews in Search will also reportedly be present when using the app. Additionally, Search's AI Overviews will offer aid with students' homework.

However, anyone who’s played poker knows it’s not always the best hand that wins. Strategy, timing, and knowing when to go all-in often matter more than the cards themselves. Apple’s September event at Apple Park was, at first glance, a showcase of a strong hand: sleek devices, bold design, and carefully crafted messaging.</p><p>But the real game runs deeper. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone 17 Air and Pro lineup</a> may be Apple’s “pocket aces,” but they aren’t enough on their own to drive the next wave of growth, which is Apple’s ultimate endgame. Apple’s real bet lies in three calculated moves: disciplined pricing, design-driven differentiation, and aggressive trade-in incentives. While most Android players focus on price wars and long spec sheets, Apple is counting on these three strategic moves to make the aces matter and ‘win the hand’ —  fuel a massive upgrade cycle in the year ahead.</p><h2 id="bet-1-design-driven-product-differentiation-2">Bet 1: Design-driven product differentiation  </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS" name="Tim-Cook-Apple-iPhone-17-event" alt="Tim Cook on stage at the iPhone 17 launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1183" height="666" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Air — Style Icon: </strong>Apple knows design sells, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test">iPhone Air</a> is built to turn heads. Slim, lightweight, and instantly recognizable, it appeals to consumers who value aesthetics over maxed-out performance. At 5.6mm, it is slimmer than the 5.7mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and $100 cheaper.</p><p>What impressed me most was how incredibly light it felt. “It feels like Air,” I said, a sentiment echoed across Steve Jobs Theater.

Still, most models held steady while storage doubled, giving consumers more for the same cost. Even the Air delivers a premium product just under $1,000.</p><p>This restraint sends a clear message to its consumers: Apple won’t add pressure to already-stretched wallets. That promise matters more than any spec sheet in today’s inflationary climate, and it will help sustain Apple’s momentum in emerging markets where long-term growth rests.</p><p>Apple is able to lean into its scale, vertical integration, and supply chain control to make this strategy work without hurting profitability, a play most Android rivals can’t match. While competitors struggle with shrinking margins and price wars, Apple is cementing its 40% value share of the smartphone market and 70% share of the premium ($1,000+) segment.</p><h2 id="bet-3-the-upgrades-engine-2">Bet 3: The upgrades engine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH" name="iPhone-13-Pro-Max" alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this feeds into Apple’s endgame: driving a massive upgrade cycle. The Air serves as a style icon, the Pro models target heavy users, and the baseline 17 offers strong value. Stable pricing lowers upgrade friction and reinforces value, while aggressive trade-ins (up to $1,100 in the US) make upgrading a “no-brainer.” Early preorder data suggests the strategy is already working.</p><p>To top it off, over 430 million iPhones shipped in 2020–2021 are now hitting the 4–5-year mark — the typical upgrade window for iOS users per IDC. No matter what model they bought then, the iPhone 17 lineup gives them a compelling reason to trade up.</p><h2 id="the-final-hand-2">The final hand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For Android OEMs, this is a learning opportunity.

Its mix of design differentiation, price restraint, and ecosystem lock-in pulls users forward, even when rivals match or exceed specs.</p><p>Apple’s event may not have delivered the slimmest phone in the smartphone world or the loudest AI when you stack it against Android counterparts, but its real play is subtle and powerful: the sum of design, pricing, and trade-in incentives.

Weeks ahead of the next installment of Prime Day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet has slid back down to 36% off</strong></a>, making the lockscreen ad version just $90 for members.</p><p>Those who don't want the lockscreen ads, can pay to have them removed at the time of purchase or later on. Additionally, while this sale is for the base-level, 32GB edition of the tablet, you can also get the 64GB version for 44% off and just $10 more.</p><p>In any case, we think the Fire HD 10 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-tablet-for-sharing">best Fire tablet for sharing</a>, partially because it's a solid, affordable Amazon device with easy Alexa compatibility, parental controls, and a wide range of apps. Named for its touchscreen display of slightly over 10 inches, users get a Full HD resolution, around 13 hours of battery life, built-in Dolby Atmos speakers, and more—all for under $100 with this discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k" name="123 1.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 10:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$139.99</del> <strong>$89.99 for Amazon's Early Prime Day Deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's Prime Day event <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">is confirmed</a> for October 7 and 8, but weeks ahead of that, the retailer has launched a familiar deal: 36% off the price of the Fire HD 10 tablet. We like this tablet for its affordability (especially as it regularly gets discounted), as well as its decent-looking, 10.1-inch touchscreen. It's certainly no premium tablet, but it's a good, affordable addition to any Alexa smart home household, or to families who are looking for budget-friendly versatility.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a cheap tablet deal with easy access to Alexa voice assistance; you're planning on getting a tablet that can be used as a shared device, potentially including parental controls for family use; you want a tablet for under $100 that will still get the job done and offer decent battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a premium-level tablet and you need high-level performance or an AMOLED screen; you need your tablet to have high-res cameras for meetings, photos, or videos; you aren't otherwise an Alexa user and you might prefer a device compatible with another digital ecosystem, such as Samsung or Google.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Amazon Fire HD 10</a> is our favorite Fire tablet for sharing, and there's more than one reason why. The latest generation of the lineup offers a decent 10.1-inch Full HD display, and either 32GB or 64GB storage options, both of which are on sale at the time of writing.</p><p>Plus, it comes with a built-in mic, speakers, and a 5MP selfie cam that's good enough for basic video calling (though it may not be the top pick for high-level professional meetings).</p><p>For those who need more than 64GB of storage, the HD 10 also comes with a microSD port that will allow users to get up to 1TB of expandable storage. Performance is backed by a 2x Arm Cortex-A76 Octa-Core processor and 3GB of RAM, which isn't much but should allow some multi-tasking.</p><p>Overall, it's not a bad pick for under $100, but if you can hold out for the official Prime Day sale, we can probably expect to see an even bigger discount.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The powerful image editor within the Gemini app, which leverages Google's DeepMind, lets users get extremely whacky with their ideas, and let Gemini do the rest. There are several "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-nano-banana-examples/">use cases</a>" that have stood out this month, such as turning a photo of a cat into a pixel-world video game.</p><p>Custom Gems you've created through Gemini can now be shared, as well as using the AI in Canvas to create an app "with no coding experience."

Meta is looking for its iPhone moment with a metaverse strategy involving VR, AR, and smart glasses, and it might just have one. Products like Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta shades are flying off the shelves, and are even starting to get mainstream attention.</p><p>A lineup of smart glasses once confined to a few Ray-Ban styles now includes new products such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Ray-Ban Meta Display. Meta's smart glasses product offerings are becoming more varied and attainable in every way but one: accessibility. You can choose to get Meta tech in a growing assortment of eyewear brands, frames, and styles, but if your eye prescription isn't supported, you might be out of look.</p><p>To be clear, Meta is doing amazing things with accessibility for people with low vision and blindness. Be My Eyes support and commands like "Hey Meta, look and describe" use the cameras onboard smart glasses and AI to provide audio descriptions of the real world to people who couldn't otherwise see them. It's some of the most exciting accessibility technology available, powered by Meta glasses.</p><p>However, there's a community somewhere in the middle that's being underserved by Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica. All of Meta's smart glasses have low prescription ranges, from the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> to the latest Ray-Ban Meta Display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">I fell outside those ranges in 2024</a>, and after a year of waiting for Meta to improve its offerings, I'm taking matters into my own hands and ordering custom lenses elsewhere.</p><h2 id="why-meta-s-supported-prescription-ranges-aren-t-cutting-it-2">Why Meta's supported prescription ranges aren't cutting it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-4" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Officially, Meta supports prescription lenses between -6.00 to +4.00 total power on the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN. For Meta Ray-Ban Display, the prescription range is even tighter, between -4.00 to +4.00 total power. While this might feel like a step backward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> has a screen built into the right lens, presumably adding technical limitations to supporting higher-strength eye prescriptions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> isn't available with prescription lenses at all; that isn't surprising because neither are the Oakley Sphaera frames they are based on. However, there are third-party prescription inserts available for Sphaera, so it'll be interesting to see whether they pop up for Vanguard in the future.</p><p>The reason why I'm tough on Meta for its limited support for prescription lenses is that it's an easy problem to solve. Using high-index lenses, higher prescriptions outside of Meta's currently-supported range can be made thinner, fitting into frames like Meta Ray-Ban and Meta Oakley HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP" name="Oakley-Meta-HSTN-display-shelf" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses on display in all five styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta competitors, such as Solos, offer a much wider prescription strength range of -15.00 to +10.00 when using these thin lenses. Additionally, third-party sites like GlassesUSA and Lensology are filling the gap by making custom lenses for prescriptions beyond what Meta provides through its own online shop and partner retailers.</p><p>I was hoping that, since the prescription lens problem was seemingly solved by third parties, Meta would expand support for a wider variety of prescription needs with its latest round of smart glasses announcements. There were even pre-Connect rumors of Meta glasses designed specifically for prescription lenses. Unfortunately, that didn't happen — the supported range stayed the same for Meta's basic smart glasses, and shrunk for the new display version.</p><p>I'm not sure what the holdup is for Meta in addressing this key limitation, but after waiting through the Oakley Meta launch and Connect 2025, I've decided to stop holding my breath and purchase lenses via a third-party instead.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta for comment regarding its prescription lens support for smart glasses and its future plans, but the company didn't immediately respond. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-not-waiting-and-you-shouldn-t-either-2">Why I'm not waiting, and you shouldn't either</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-side-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If smart glasses are truly the future, manufacturers need to do everything they can to make them accessible to everyone. That includes people with vision correction needs who can't or don't want to wear contacts. All tech should be accessible, but if smart glasses really are the future of communication and productivity, there's even more pressure to make the form factor work for everyone.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said during a 2025 earnings call that people without smart glasses would be at "a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people" in the future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-people-without-ai-glasses-will-be-at-a-disadvantage-in-the-future/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). That kind of language puts smart glasses in the realm of necessity rather than luxury, meaning that people needing glasses for basic sight shouldn't have to wait for them to become <em>smart</em>.</p><p>Instead, I ordered Oakley Meta HSTN and prescription lenses from Lensology separately to get the experience in the here and now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lensology.co.uk" target="_blank">Lensology</a> is a lens crafter based in the U.K. that specializes in "click and fit" service — you order custom lenses online and pop them into your frames when they show up at your door. I uploaded my prescription, picked Transitions lenses, and placed my order.</p><p>If all goes well, in a week or two, I'll have my prescription Oakley Meta HSTN glasses ready to wear — despite my vision-correction needs being unsupported by official Meta retail channels. While I still hope Meta one day expands its prescription lens offerings, people shouldn't have to wait to experience this essential tech, and they don't have to thanks to services like Lensology.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="80024167-89bf-44ed-b0b9-03b7d3bdaa3e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QR2XTuj5vdUaC8ZbiHtMM.jpg' alt="An official product render of brown Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its charging case"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Great smart glasses...</strong></em></p><p>...if you don't need prescription lenses or your needs fall within the supported range.

What's also impressive is that Samsung managed to make the 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>, now matching up with Apple's 13-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">M4 iPad Pro</a>.

With the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra, Samsung is finally implementing some useful features, specifically with DeX. Instead of fiddling around with USB-C capture cards and adapters, "Extended Mode" lets you plug your tablet into a monitor and have the screen extended.</p><p>One feature I'm excited to get my hands on is the ability to create different "workspaces" when using DeX.

Meaning that if you want a tablet that doubles as a portable workstation, you'll need to pay even more to grab a keyboard case.</p><p>Not to mention that, unlike the Tab S11, Samsung has yet to release a successor to the Book Cover Keyboard that includes the trackpad. Currently, only the Book Cover Keyboard Slim is available, which has limited viewing angles and lacks a trackpad. It might not be a big deal to some, but for others, it's rather disappointing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing you probably noticed about the Tab S11 lineup is that Samsung decided against releasing an updated "Plus" model.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Mate XT</a> is the coolest phone I used, and while I was initially worried about its durability, that hasn't proven to be an issue. Similarly, Huawei's tablets are increasingly gaining momentum, and I thoroughly enjoyed using the MatePad 11.5 S and MatePad Pro 12.2.</p><p>But it's with wearables and audio products where the brand has the most potential. While the inability to use Google's services — including the Play Store — is a hindrance on phones and tablets, it isn't anywhere as much of a limitation on a smartwatch. And with the Watch Ultimate 2, Huawei is proving that it can deliver a smartwatch that outmatches the best its rivals have to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 isn't markedly different to its predecessor, with Huawei instead making useful tweaks around battery life and polishing the design. The smartwatch is going on sale alongside the Watch GT 6 and GT 6 Pro, and is coming to several global markets, including the U.K. The Watch Ultimate 2 is debuting at €999 ($1,175) for the blue model (which I'm using), and there's a black model that costs €899 ($1,057) — similar to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and €200 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a>.</p><h2 id="design-that-s-built-to-stand-out-2">Design that's built to stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We need to start with the design, because the Watch Ultimate 2 has a domineering presence; the massive 48.5mm watch case is designed to grab attention, and the smartwatch is available in two models: a black option, and a blue variant. The blue color has a dual-tone effect with white undertones, and it makes the watch stand out even more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 has a woven fluoroelastomer band (in blue and white) as standard, and Huawei also includes a metal band in the box if you need to switch it out. Either band is of a high quality, and feel great to use.

I prefer wearing bigger watches, and the Watch Ultimate 2 definitely delivers on that front. The watch gets an octagonal design that's an evolution from last year, with the chassis made out of an zirconium alloy and the bezel featuring ceramic.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4896" height="2758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bezel includes the name of the watch quite prominently — there's no mistaking that from the design anyway. There are three buttons, with one on the left and two to the right. The bottom button on the right serves as a shortcut, allowing you to pull up health data, make calls, or initiate a workout.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The button up top has a built-in crown, and is used for navigating the interface. There's good feedback while navigating with the crown, and there's no lag in general. The Watch Ultimate 2 has a 1.5-inch OLED panel that's the same size as last year, and it gets LTPO 2 tech. It goes up to a maximum of 3,500 nits, which is a bit excessive. I didn't see any issues using the Watch Ultimate 2 outdoors even under harsh sunlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2624" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 466 x 466 resolution is decent enough, and the size of the panel means there are no issues viewing incoming notifications from the phone.

Interestingly, the techniques Huawei designed to make the watch resilient to the pressure at 150 meters allows it to withstand daily rigors much better, including soapy water and seawater ingress. Also, it has a sonar device that sends out audio pulses; obviously, I wasn't about to go diving just to test the feature, but Huawei has an above-water testing mode that lets you use it, which is just plain cool.</p><p>Golf is a big part of the smartwatch's differentiation, with Huawei providing useful guidance and course-related details. Huawei added a new antenna in the Watch Ultimate 2 with better signal strength and dual-band GPS, giving it better accuracy while on a trail or running outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health monitoring is a core tenet of any smartwatch, and the Watch Ultimate 2 uses Huawei's new TruSense system that consists of an ECG, PPG, and pressure sensors.

The UI is fluid and easy to navigate, and there's plenty of customizability. One issue is that you'll need to sideload Huawei Health if you're using a Pixel device like I am; it was a bit of a hassle to get the app installed on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.

Otherwise, it has been enjoyable to use the Watch Ultimate 2, and it is better than the Galaxy Watch Ultra in daily use. I got better battery life as well, with the watch easily lasting over two days even with heavy use, extending to three days with medium use. That's a huge uptick from most smartwatches I have on hand, and only the Fenix 8 lasts longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Watch Ultimate 2 is a terrific choice if you need a high-end smartwatch that's loaded with features.

The massive size makes it easily stand out, and the bright OLED panel along with fluid software and standout battery life gives it a distinct edge.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Overall, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> seemed like a hit, but I was skeptical for one reason: the thickness and weight of the device.</p><p>Google Pixel phones have long jam-packed features and battery life into chunky form factors, but the Pixel 10 Pro felt like a step too far. At 8.6mm thick and weighing 207 grams, the Pixel 10 Pro dwarfed competing options from Samsung and Apple, adding a tenth of a millimeter and seven grams to the already-huge Pixel 9 Pro. To me, it was a dealbreaker.</p><p>Then, Apple did the unexpected and made the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max thicker and heavier than basically any competitor on the market — including the Pixel 10 Pro and XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. I haven't exactly changed my tune, but the iPhone 17 Pro series' gargantuan dimensions have certainly made me appreciate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">the Pixel 10 Pro and XL models</a> more.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-is-hiding-the-iphone-17-pro-s-shockingly-large-build-2">iPhone Air is hiding the iPhone 17 Pro's shockingly-large build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh" name="iPhone-17-Pro-side-view" alt="Side view of the iPhone 17 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're only now hearing about how huge the iPhone 17 Pro is, you're not alone. We've all been laser-focused on the iPhone Air and its polarizing nature, and that has let Apple's moves on the Pro models fly under the radar. Here's the rundown: both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max measure 8.75mm, making them the thickest iPhones since the iPhone 5c released way back in 2013.</p><p>That doesn't include the camera <em>plateau</em>, which adds extra thickness to the overall package. Apple also added eight grams to the weight of the iPhone 17 Pro and six grams to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. In other words, these are absolutely humongous smartphones that will take up a ton of space in your hands, pockets, or bags. Compared to the 8.25mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a>, this is a drastic change.</p><p>I'm all for consumer choice, and there are people who'll be thrilled that the Pro models are packed with more features and more battery. There's the iPhone Air for people like me, who crave a thin and lightweight package. Then you have the iPhone 17 in the middle, and the robust Pro and Pro Max on the other end of the lineup.</p><p>It's a solid set of iPhones, but I can't help but think how much better the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL look compared to the sheer size and mass of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.</p><h2 id="maybe-the-google-pixel-10-pro-series-isn-t-too-bad-after-all-2">Maybe the Google Pixel 10 Pro series isn't too bad after all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="49MtiP55A8HsE63TZPgVhT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-back-02" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/49MtiP55A8HsE63TZPgVhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was easy to criticize Google when the Pixel 10 Pro was released, as it was notably larger than the iPhone 16 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Now that the iPhone 17 Pro is here and it's a behemoth, it feels different. On paper, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro have quite a bit in common — similar battery capacities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnets</a>, and a triple-camera rear system — and yet the Pixel 10 Pro manages to be thinner and lighter.</p><p>Put simply, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro and XL look like a much more impressive design and engineering feat than they appeared just a month prior. Thinner and lighter flagship phones, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, lack <em>something </em>that explains the discrepancy, such as magnets. Google has nearly everything Apple put in the iPhone 17 Pro, while undercutting its size and weight.</p><p>Both phones are still probably too thick and heavy for what I'd prefer to carry on a daily basis. But if you're like me and initially scoffed at the form factor and heft of Google's new phones, maybe the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max give you a better appreciation for the Pixel 10 Pro and XL.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c511ad96-db7c-49ba-8f0a-31fe8b6fd3fb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A sneaky contender</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro isn't nearly as thin as I'd like, but it handily clears the iPhone 17 Pro when it comes to thickness and weight.

However, the company is now dipping its toes into the budget market with the announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-Pocket-AIR-Mini">Pocket AIR Mini</a>.</p><p>We first learned about the handheld in early September, with only a handful of details being shared. Until now, we knew that it would share the same design as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-air-review">Pocket AIR</a>, an Android gaming handheld from 2023. AYANEO also touted the Mini as being the "world's first handheld with a brand-new 4:3 retro display."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jpmnTrlu3k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>With the launches of the Pocket DS and KONKR Pocket FIT out of the way, AYANEO pulled back the curtains on what the Pocket AIR Mini aims to offer. More than anything else, the most surprising aspect of the reveal was that the AIR Mini will start at just $89 for the base model. But for a limited time once pre-orders open, you'll be able to snag one for just $69.</p><p>When you take a look at the other AYANEO handhelds announced this year, it's immediately apparent why this is a big deal. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-pocket-s2-and-s2-pro-pre-orders-are-now-open-with-shipping-to-begin-soon">Pocket S2</a>, powered by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, starts at $499. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">Pocket ACE</a>, with its G3x Gen 2 chip, retails for $389 in its base configuration, and of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">Pocket DS</a> will set you back $519 once its released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-mini-color-options-render" alt="AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, AYANEO is apparently setting out to change the narrative as we get closer to the end of the year. The company's most recent Android handheld, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, is actually the first from a new "budget-minded lineup. It's powered by either the G3 Gen 3, or the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and starts at either $299 or $329.</p><p>That said, the Pocket AIR Mini is an even further drop down the price bracket, and we mostly have the processor to thank. AYANEO is dipping back into the MediaTek well and pulling out an oldie, as the Helio G90T will power the AIR Mini. This offers slightly less performance than even the Helio G99, the same SoC found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a> and Pocket Micro Classic.</p><p>Here's how the rest of the specs shake out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>4.2-inch LCD, 1280 x 960, 4:3, 60Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Helio G90T</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPU</p></td><td  ><p>Mali-G76 MP4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>2GB / 3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB / 64GB + microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4500mAh, 18W Charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Hall Sticks and Triggers, Audio vibration, Custom Performance Modes, Active Cooling</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Retro White, Aurora Black, Retro Power</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the specs aren't really all that impressive at first glance.

Now, according to a recent report, Samsung will be bringing this new form factor to the U.S. market. A "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/18/tech/samsung-trifold-phone-galaxy-s26-edge">told CNN</a> that the U.S. has been a part of their launch discussions.</p><p>Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone only in South Korea first, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. The company has historically introduced new devices, such as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6"> Galaxy Z Fold 6 special edition</a>, or an experimental device in limited markets like South Korea and China, before a wider release.</p><p>However, it could be switching things up with the Trifold by simultaneously launching it in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifolding-phone-might-debut-as-soon-as-this-month">launch rumors</a> about the "Galaxy Z TriFold" suggest that Samsung is planning to host another Galaxy Unpacked event in South Korea on September 29 to introduce some new devices. The leak claims that Samsung will also launch its first-ever XR headset (codenamed Project Moohan) and its first pair of AI glasses, reportedly called Galaxy Glasses, during the event.</p><p>As for launching the TriFold in the U.S., Samsung could be trying to one-up Apple, as it is yet to launch a foldable, while this Korean OEM is ready to bring out a device that folds not just once, but inward from both sides, and not bringing it to a wider market would be a shame.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag. We are still seeing conflicting launch details, with some suggesting the end of this month, while others say the trifold will arrive only in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vats explicitly states that these are the "first test builds" Samsung has crafted using its latest flagship series. The builds bear version numbers S938BXXU5CYIA, S938BOXM5CYIA, and S938BXXU5CYIA for the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra.</p><p>While some users in the thread are holding out hope for a public One UI 8.5 beta, Vats expresses uncertainty.</p><p>There's not much else to dissect about this, as Samsung's only getting started with the 0.5 addition to its One UI 8 software. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-ultra-first-one-ui-8-5-firmware/">SamMobile</a> theorizes that we likely won't see this update roll out until next year, when Samsung is expected to launch its Galaxy S26 series.

This update was speculated to bring "large improvements" to the Galaxy S26 series. Tipsters stated that the supposed existence of an 8.5 would bring more substantial updates to Samsung's Galaxy devices over a smaller, iterative "8.1" patch.</p><p>The assumptions didn't stop there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-finally-make-swipe-navigation-the-default-setup-option-on-new-phones">as another rumor</a> states One UI 8.5 could bring the option to choose between gesture and button navigation during your initial device startup. The choices could be given on a dedicated splash screen, with each option available to tap before moving on to other new device setup items. Currently, after turning on your Galaxy device for the first time, you need to dive into its Settings to change your navigational preference.</p><p>This change would be a welcome one if Samsung is truly looking to do so.</p><p>We're putting One UI 8.5 to the side for now and getting starry-eyed at Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-expands-finally-for-galaxy-s25-and-foldables-ai-features-and-enhanced-security">official launch of One UI 8</a> (Android 16).

The majority of this patch seems focused on refining ebook reading, as well as the overall UI elements users interact with on Kindle. To begin, the patch reportedly adds the option for Kindle users to alter the font size of their device's UI.</p><p>The publication spotted this new capability in the Screen and Brightness settings.</p><p>When it comes to reading, the newest patch is rolling out a text spacing settings option. Sometimes the spacing of sentences on the page helps with readability, which is what Amazon's update aims to help users with. The post states that, within the "Aa" settings menu of an ebook, users can edit the line, paragraph, word, and character spacing. Users can even lock their Kindle in portrait or landscape mode, so your reading material doesn't morph on you when you're getting comfortable in that blanket.</p><p>While those feature additions are the core of this new update this month, the publication highlights an expansion of Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=122146457011">Kindle Assistive Reader</a>.

I bought the Stanmore a decade ago, and it has served me well over the years — I still use it regularly, and it sounds fabulous. I also enjoy using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/marshall-kilburn-ii-review">Kilburn II</a>, and as good as it is, it isn't the most portable.</p><p>That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-iii-review">Emberton III</a> comes in. It isn't the smallest Marshall speaker — that's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Willen-Bluetooth-Portable-Speaker/dp/B0DD7T8H2Q">Willen II</a> — but its inherent portability gives it a distinct advantage. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">in at $149 on Amazon</a>, it's much more affordable than Marshall's other speakers. The sizing is a key part of why I like the Emberton III so much, and in the last two months, I used the speaker more than just about any other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Q5xqSZgJtbqdVfX65CPvA5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5xqSZgJtbqdVfX65CPvA5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Marshall's speakers have a distinctive design that's similar to the brand's iconic amps, and the Emberton III is no different. I like that the brand ported the design aesthetic into a smaller form factor, and the metal grille at the front with the embossed Marshall logo allows the Emberton III to stand out visually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But you're not buying it for the looks; the sound quality is where the Emberton III comes into its own. The speaker produces 20W of sound via two 10W full-range drivers, and there are dual passive radiators as well. Now, 20W may not seem like a lot when there are portable speakers like the Tribit StormBox Blast 2 that go up to 200W, but the Emberton III cleverly utilizes the internal design to produce a much louder sound than the hardware suggests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is that the Emberton III punches well above its weight when it comes to how loud it gets; most of the time, I didn't have to increase the volume beyond 60%. The sound quality is quintessential Marshall; there's a pronounced bass with a tight sub-bass that sounds delightful, detailed mid-range that lets vocals and ensemble instruments shine, and clean treble without any sibilance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4822" height="2716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The drivers are angled within the chassis, so you get a stereo soundstage that's immersive. While there are no toggles to change the bass and treble levels like on the Stanmore, you can use the Marshall app to switch between three EQ modes. It isn't as configurable, but if you need to double down on the bass, there's an EQ setting that lets you do just that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Emberton III sounds as good as it looks, and I was constantly impressed by its performance in this area. It's hard to pull off something like this in an enclosure that's just 160mm wide and 1.2lb in weight, and Marshall did a terrific job overall. The smaller size makes it easier to take the Emberton III anywhere, and the design is clearly built to last. The speaker took its share of tumbles in the last two months, and it came away unscathed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are other niceties; the Emberton III gets IP67 ingress protection, making it ideal to use at the pool or the shower. There's a built-in mic that lets you take calls on the speaker, and that's a decent addition. You also get good onboard controls; there's a multi-function knob at the top that lets you adjust volume, play or pause media, and go forward or back. The dedicated Bluetooth button puts the Emberton III into pairing mode, you get a power button, and there's a battery life indicator.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is pretty great too; I got over 24 hours of use with the volume turned up, and that's better than most other speakers in this category. It takes just over two hours to charge the battery via USB-C, and fast charging delivers up to six hours of music playback with a 20-minute charge.</p><p>It connects over Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn't see any problems with range or connectivity. I used the Emberton III with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, and a slew of Android phones. The only issue I have with connectivity is that it doesn't have AptX codecs, limited instead to the usual SBC and AAC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PHPH8BSrYxF5JZTEagNA95" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PHPH8BSrYxF5JZTEagNA95.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've already invested in Marshall's products or are looking to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that stands out, the Emberton III is a no-brainer. The smaller size means you can take it anywhere, and the durable design combined with IP67 dust and water resistance makes it weather just about any environment.</p><p>The sound quality is where the Emberton III excels over other products I used in the last 12 months; it gets louder, more detailed, and delivers a surprising amount of sound considering the size of the speaker. The $149 asking price is at the higher end of the scale as these things go, but you're also getting a speaker that's better than just about anything else in this category.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a8b5742a-3345-4e52-8613-d21382adab4f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8SjG44BgG6qhEJfgcQdBwa.jpg' alt="Marshall Emberton III Bluetooth speaker in Black and Brass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Marshall Emberton III</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Don't let its size fool you; the Emberton III delivers a booming sound that's full of vibrancy and character. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

But it doesn't put you inside a cockpit in first-person view, as you might expect for VR; instead, it's more of a top-down racing style where you have to react quickly to obstacles and power-ups floating into the play space.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpTaz7BB3zUCUHNLhqhByA" name="Star-Wars-Beyond-Victory-podrace" alt="A gameplay screenshot from Star Wars: Beyond Victory, showing a podrace on a barren planet with a live leaderboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpTaz7BB3zUCUHNLhqhByA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ILM)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fans of the N64 game might have preferred a first-person game with cockpit immersion, similar to Squadrons.
