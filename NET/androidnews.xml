<p>After Apple recently announced its latest M4-powered series of MacBook Pro's, the company made another change that was unexpected. Every current MacBook in Apple's lineup now ships with 16GB of RAM as a base, an upgrade from the previous minimum of 8GB.</p><p>Originally, I was going to compare the MacBook Air to the current crop of Chromebooks until I realized that you can't get a new MacBook for less than $1,100. Meanwhile, the most expensive Chromebook is the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, which is $400 cheaper. Yes, I know there are still a few HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebooks floating around, but those aren't as widely available and are clearly being phased out.</p><p>After some prodding in a meeting, I turned my attention to a comparison that <em>does</em> make sense: Chromebook vs. iPad.</p>

<p>Currently, there are six different iPad models to choose from, starting with the iPad (10th generation) for $349 and going all the way up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">M4 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> for $1,299. Meanwhile, the cheapest Chromebook that's been released in 2024 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-fortis-chromebooks-2024-announcement">HP Chromebook 14-inch</a>, which retails for $249.</p><p>From there, we have a variety of options at different price points, and while the majority of them are laptops, there are a couple of tablets thrown into the mix. These include the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">ASUS Chromebook CM30</a>, and more recently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M3dUF5rkP2jHjSAKQa3jRj" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-1.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 propped vertically" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3dUF5rkP2jHjSAKQa3jRj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both of these are tablets, ASUS and Lenovo include a keyboard case in the box. In doing so, it removes any potential stress and additional cost for those who want a true 2-in-1 device. On the other hand, no matter what iPad you're considering, the only other thing that comes in the box is a charging cable.</p><p>Making matters worse for the iPad is that if you want to go with first-party accessories, Apple's Magic Keyboard Folio is priced at $249. Plus, if you want a stylus, tack on another $79, bringing the grand total to about $680.</p><p>That immediately puts the "cheapest" iPad in the same price bracket as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and Chromebook Plus Spin 714. It is also almost $300 more expensive than the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11.</p><p>And we haven't even talked about the hardware or specs.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-16.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, what are you getting with the base model iPad for $349? It's powered by the A14 Bionic SoC, which debuted with the iPhone 12 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review">iPad Air in 2020</a>. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, and if you want to use it anywhere, there are Cellular options available.</p><p>I'm not going to sugarcoat anything here, but there's a good reason why Apple is able to "get away" with using a four-year-old processor without facing much backlash. Since Apple controls the entire "stack," it's able to better optimize the software and hardware, when it relies on older processors. This is also why Apple was able to maintain its position as a leader in the industry when it comes to providing software updates for longer than the competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JhSg5h3YR8hLjLQkWruzgb" name="MediaTek-Kampino-520-528-hero.jpg" alt="The new MediaTek Kompanio chips for Chromebooks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhSg5h3YR8hLjLQkWruzgb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Chromebooks, the aforementioned ASUS Chromebook CM30 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/mediatek-kompanio-520-528-launch">MediaTek Kompanio 520</a>. It also sports 4GB of RAM and 64GB of non-upgradeable storage. But as I mentioned before, ASUS includes the detachable keyboard folio case in the box, which is already a huge benefit, even if you don't plan to use it all that much.</p><p>Performance is where things take a sharp turn. On Geekbench, the Kompanio 520 offers a single-core score of 510 and a multi-core score of 1532. Despite being four years old, the A12 Bionic achieved scores of 1590 and 4247, respectively. Let me put it this way: the cheapest iPad is closer to the Intel-powered Galaxy Chromebook Plus in terms of performance.</p><p>It's not even close; the iPad wins by a landslide here.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AxXbRAekQDdfvQnXsV5Trj" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AxXbRAekQDdfvQnXsV5Trj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is the key to everything, and this is where a sub-$300 Chromebook outshines even a $1300 iPad. With a Chromebook, you not only have access to the ever-growing world of web apps and extensions, but the Play Store is also just a click away. Not to mention that there's an even bigger repository of apps at your disposal if you feel comfortable enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">enable Linux support</a>.</p><p>On an iPad, everything is powered by either the App Store or Safari, and there is just a little bit of wiggle room for anything else. While you can use Chrome or Firefox on an iPad, you won't find any extension support, and for whatever reason, web apps don't always feel as fluid as they do on a Chromebook.</p><p>While important, I'd argue that usability is even more important, especially when it comes to things like using more than one app at a time. The iPad is superb if you're trying to stay focused on one app, but it immediately begins to fall short when you want to toss another app into the mix.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WEEobcWZ3WxmYUfg8ruqjn" name="ipad-pro-2021-stage-manager-ipados-16-1.jpg" alt="Stage Manager on iPad Pro - 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEEobcWZ3WxmYUfg8ruqjn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"But what about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">Stage Manager</a>?" You might be asking, and I'm glad you did. When enabled, it lets you use up to four different apps at the same time. Allowing you to resize and move them around with relative ease. There's even a slide-out "dock" of sorts, letting you basically work within different spaces that are comprised of different apps.</p><p>Technically another app can be used, provided that you can remember that the Slide Over is at your disposal or even how to use it. But it's cumbersome at best, and downright useless more often than not.</p><p>None of that is a problem with a Chromebook, as it works just like any other desktop operating system. The only difference comes when using either a ChromeOS tablet or a Chromebook with a convertible form factor. When doing so, it's more similar to using any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> or iPad, with your app windows locked to a few different layouts.</p><p>However, I'd still argue that Google's implementation is still a bit better. Instead of trying to guess where to put app windows, you can just swipe down from the top of the screen and pick from a few different layouts. These include being able to put an app off to the side and slide it back into view.</p>

<p>This might just sound like a puff piece for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, and to a certain extent, it kind of is. But it's just because I feel as though we're finally moving away from the days of seeing a million different cheap Chromebooks that are underpowered or just bad. In years past, I would have likely recommended an iPad to just about anyone who asked, regardless of how they planned to use it.</p><p>However, the landscape has shifted quite dramatically for Chromebooks. For one, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/ask-jerry-choosing-the-right-chromebook">Chromebook Plus</a>, you know exactly what the minimum specs are, so there's no need to worry about compromising. Regardless of whether you want a tablet or a laptop, you have options to choose from, both of which are going to be either in-line or less expensive than what you would spend on an iPad.</p>

The same is true for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> as well, which is overall a rather modest update over its predecessor. However, the latest version of Google&apos;s popular mobile OS does pack in several new features that are designed to improve your everyday user experience, with &apos;Private Space&apos; being one such addition.</p><p>Essentially a digital vault, Private Space lets you conveniently lock sensitive apps (and by extension, the data accessible through them) in a separate sandbox. You can also set up a second instance of any app in Private Space, which can be then secured with a locking mechanism (e.g., fingerprint, PIN) that&apos;s different from your Pixel&apos;s phone&apos;s main screen lock. Sounds like something you can benefit from? Here&apos;s how to create Private Space for your apps on Pixel, and give the confidential information on your phone an additional layer of protection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-private-space-for-apps-on-your-pixel-2">How to create Private Space for apps on your Pixel</h2>
<p>In addition to the obvious requirement of Android 15, Private Space needs a device having more than 6GB of RAM. Thankfully, the majority of Google&apos;s recent smartphones — including all members of the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> series — fulfill these conditions. Also, this feature doesn&apos;t work on managed devices that are usually issued by organizations to their employees. With that said, here&apos;s how to get started with Private Space.</p>

<p>Google Pixels are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> available in the market, and one of the major reasons for that is the top-tier software experience that they come with. When you buy a Pixel smartphone, you&apos;re the first in line to get the newest software release(s), which often include many Pixel-exclusive goodies.</p><p>One such feature is Private Space, which ensures that you—and only you—can see and interact with the confidential apps on your smartphone. Apart from the regular screen lock, Private Space provides your data with an additional layer of protection. It&apos;s extremely easy to set up, lets you run a second instance of any app, and can even be hidden away from view. It&apos;s just one of the many gems you can find in Android 15, which is best experienced on a top-of-the-line device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a>, which offers a gorgeous design, class-leading cameras, superb everyday performance, and more.</p>

<ul><li>A report reveals that Samsung is eyeing a Galaxy S25 Slim, expected to launch a few months after the main series.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is set to debut in January or February 2025, with the S25 Slim possibly following in April.</li><li>The S25 Slim is likely to have a limited launch, similar to the Galaxy Z Fold SE, allowing Samsung to gauge market interest and adjust future models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With rumors swirling about Apple’s plans for a slimmer iPhone, Samsung is also eyeing a thinner model of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineup.</p><p>According to a recent report from South Korea’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241031000259" target="_blank">ET News</a>, Samsung is looking into launching a Galaxy S25 Slim—a thinner version of the S25 series—set to make its debut a few months after the main models (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/31/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-report-iphone/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This speculation comes on the heels of buzz around an iPhone 17 "Air" and Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">unexpected Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition launch in South Korea</a>—a refined, slimmer take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It debuted a few days ago, only a few months after the original model.</p><p>Apple’s rumored slimmer iPhone 17 is supposed to sport a 6.6-inch screen and a single rear camera, but it’s unclear what trade-offs Samsung might make for its Galaxy S25 Slim. With the current slimmest S24 at 7.6mm, the S25 Slim could be set to get even thinner.</p><p>Samsung is likely to unveil the Galaxy S25 series in January or February of next year, with the Galaxy S25 Slim possibly arriving by April, as per tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1851884968919863735" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>. Rumor has it this slim edition is a bit of a test run to see how fans respond—and if it takes off, we might just see a Galaxy S26 Slim in the following year.</p><p>With this strategy in mind, the Galaxy S25 Slim will likely launch on a limited scale, similar to the local release of the Galaxy Z Fold SE. Sources gave the following statement to ET News (machine translated): "It is possible that it will release it in small quantities to gauge market response and change the lineup the year after next."</p><p>In recent years, Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle to create the sleekest smartphones. Samsung has been showcasing the Z Fold 6 as one of its thinnest models.</p><p>Meanwhile, there’s chatter about Apple potentially launching an ultra-slim iPhone 17 in 2026, which could take the place of the Plus series. To achieve that sleek look, Apple might opt for a more streamlined camera setup, likely featuring just a single wide-angle lens.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether Samsung will take a page from Apple’s book by prioritizing a slim design over all-around specs, or if it will aim for a more feature-loaded experience with its upcoming thin device.</p>

Shokz has long been one of the market leaders in the latter, but there are compromises with bone conduction headphones that Shokz has been working to overcome with their speaker technology, specifically TurboPitch.</p><p>The problem with the transducers Shokz used in the previous generation of OpenRun Pro was that they sat on your jaw and had very energetic vibrations, making TurboPitch a polarizing feature over pure bone conduction earbuds/headphones.</p><p>With the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz introduced their DualPitch technology, which builds on the lessons learned with previous generation Shokz bone conduction products. I have to say, lesson learned! Let's get into that.</p>

Shokz also recently released<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"> </a>a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"><u> white collaboration with world-renowned Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge </u></a>, with glossy gradient orange and gold accents and trim.</p><p>When it comes to the TurboPitch technology and some of the things that come with it, I’m happy to report that this year’s OpenRun series has greatly improved in that area with the introduction of DualPitch technology. This adds new non-bone conduction speakers and compliments the bone conduction transducers by making the sound richer without excess vibrations on your face.</p><p>There is minimal perceptible vibration from the DualPitch air conduction driver units in the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. Bass-heavy tracks with the volume cranked up occasionally give you some light vibration, but not to the extent of previous generation Shokz products with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/shokz-openrun-pro-review">TurboPitch technology</a>.</p><p>So, what is DualPitch, anyway? The simplest explanation is that bone conduction technology passes vibrations through your bones so that your auditory structures can pick them up, and you experience "sound." The problem with this conduction method is that almost no bass frequency is passed to you. To solve that problem, Shokz places a separate conventional driver unit inside the earbuds to add those low frequencies back into the mix. That additional unit is their "DualPitch."</p>

<p>So, that’s a little bit of background, but how do they sound? Really good! Bass heads won’t love the flatter sound signature, but products like these serve a very specific purpose, which I think makes up for that. I listened through multiple playlists while walking or running intervals on peaceful residential neighborhood backstreets and busy urban avenues.</p><p>The soundstage when listening to “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” isn’t expansive, but Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s a capella and Paul Simon’s vocals sound really good. Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” shows just how solid the sound separation produced by the OpenRun Pro 2 is. The reproduction of instrumentation staged at various locations in the sound field is really good, considering some of the limitations of the technology, which DualPitch augments.</p><p>Listening to Skrillex’s “Mumbai Place,” you can hear how this setup handles bass and sub-bass. The bass is light but present, and the sub-bass gets compromised, but the vibrations present in previous generation Shokz TurboPitch-enabled devices aren’t present. The overall sound is robust enough for your triathlon training, training runs, and dynamic workouts. It's also solid for those who don’t like something sitting in their ear canals and are searching for an open-ear product.</p><p>I also watched some long-form content, specifically “Blue Eye Samurai,” and the movie’s dialogue and sound design were both enjoyable and immersive. Fight scenes with all of their foley and that surround sound design are well presented and immersive. Sound separation when listening to film content is solid, like music. Your podcasts and long-form TikToks or IG Reels will come through clear and full.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-wearing-wide" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 on the reviewer's head, showing how the wrap around neckband fits" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the primary reasons people like Shokz and their OpenRun series is their locked-in feel. That continues with the OpenRun Pro 2! Without feeling like you have your head in a vice, the wraparound neckband helps keep everything in place. Because of the thin wires connecting everything, the OpenRun 2 feels great when wearing a bicycle helmet, hat, or glasses.</p><p>The other aspect of Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 that I like is the companion app. Let’s be clear: it’s pretty basic, but that isn’t a bad thing. You get four EQ presets to customize the sound to your liking and the ability to customize the sound yourself with a 5-band EQ that you can name and save. You also get multipoint pairing in the app, which works quite well. You have to pause to play music or media on your second device when you’re listening to the first one, but that’s standard for multipoint setups. I’ve only used one that switches sources on its own seamlessly.</p><p>You should also know that call quality is solid for the most part. I tested call quality while out for a walk during rush hour traffic, and it sounded pretty good! I recorded some audio in my office, which also sounded pretty good. On one call, though, my wife said I sounded like I was in a tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="well-executed-controls-faster-charging-2">Well Executed Controls, Faster Charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-buttons.JPG" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The controls are very easy to manipulate, even when your hands are sweaty wet. On the underside of one of the frames for the transducers is where you'll find the power and volume buttons. You'll find the multifunction button on the frame where the transducer lies, which controls device functions like play/pause, track skipping, calling, and more. It's clicky and tactile and large enough to activate easily and consistently.</p><p>You'll also find the USB-C charge port on the ear frame. It's a port protected by a flap that seals tightly enough that the inside stayed dry when I ran water over it. That part is an important update as older Shokz used magnetic charging ports, which were slower to charge you back up if you drained that battery. That would be an even tougher thing to do now that the battery is rated for 12 hours instead of eight.</p><p>The USB-C charge port is also a good thing because from dead, you'll get more than 50% charge in ten minutes of USB-C charging. Five minutes gets you roughly 2.5 hours of music playback.</p><p>The trade-off with the updated charging is decreased water resistance from the standard OpenRun product. I know this is a result of losing the magnetic charge port, but the OpenRun Pro 2 has decreased durability (IP55) from the OpenRun, which is IP67. That means you can withstand sweat and some light rain but get pushed into a swimming pool or try showering with them on and bye-bye earbuds.</p>

<p>All that glitters isn’t gold, so there are some items that I think could use some improvement. The power output is low, so you must crank the volume up on your listening source. I found this true with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p><p>I’ve found that with open-ear products, having Hi-Res support does make a difference. The additional dynamic range of files with greater data transmission than the SBC and AAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> allow, which Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 doesn't support, often makes for audio that is a bit more audible at low volumes.</p><p>Another item I’d like to see in the next version of OpenRun Pro is the EQ settings being saved to the headset. When I switch between my Android and iOS devices, the EQ settings I have on Android aren’t shown in the iOS Shokz app. I want ubiquitous EQ configuration.</p>
<p>The only fit and comfort issue anyone will encounter will surface the first time they hit the iron. With the wrap-around headband, when you settle in for any bench work, bench press, dumbbell flys, etc., you’ll have to reposition the OpenRun 2 so they don’t get in the way.</p>

<p>Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are their best bone-conduction headphones yet! They’re lightweight, supremely comfortable, and durable enough to meet their intended purpose. They are a wonderful improvement over the last generation, and most importantly, they provide solid sound for something that doesn’t sit inside your ear canal.</p><p>If you run, ride, or engage in really dynamic workouts and want something that feels like a 6.0-magnitude earthquake couldn’t knock them out of your ears, these should be at the top of your list.</p>

The Chinese manufacturer is aiming to build on that with the OnePlus 13, which was just introduced in China. </p><p>OnePlus made a lot of changes to the design, and the OnePlus 13 doesn&apos;t look like any other OnePlus device to date. You get the latest Qualcomm hardware, up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and new cameras with better Hasselblad tuning. </p>

<p>OnePlus unveiled the OnePlus 13 at a launch event in China on October 30, and the phone is set to go on sale starting November 4 in the country. There&apos;s no mention of a global launch just yet, but if the OnePlus 12 was any indication, we should see the OnePlus 13 make its way outside China in the month of January. </p><p>That said, Xiaomi is making the Xiaomi 15 available globally earlier than usual, so it may just be that OnePlus decides to follow suit — I&apos;ll update the post once I have additional details. </p><p>While it&apos;s good to see the OnePlus 13 picking up so many upgrades, the phone is considerably costlier than last year: the base 12GB/256GB model starts at 4,499 Yuan ($630), the 12GB/512GB edition is 4,899 Yuan ($688), the 16GB/512GB version costs 5,299 Yuan ($744), and the 24GB/1TB model is 5,999 Yuan ($842). </p><p>We don&apos;t know what the OnePlus 13 will cost globally, but there&apos;s usually a $100 increase over what the device sells for in China, so we could be looking at a $750 or even $799 starting figure. Again, this is all conjecture, and we should have details in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>OnePlus used the same design aesthetic on its devices for a while now, but that&apos;s changing with the OnePlus 13. The phone switches to flat sides — like so many devices available today — and it has a bulkier look as a result. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is available in white, blue, and black variants, and the blue model in particular looks gorgeous. I like that OnePlus always delivers at least one unique color variant each year; the Flowy Emerald OnePlus 12 was the definite star this year, and it looks like that mantle is taken up by the blue model in 2025.</p>

<p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the OnePlus 13 is available in a leather back. I&apos;m fond of the leather used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and it will be intriguing to see if the OnePlus 13 feels the same way in daily use. </p>
<p>Coming to the panel, OnePlus is once again using BOE as the manufacturer, and the OnePlus 13 retains the 6.82-inch AMOLED tech that we saw on the OnePlus 12. It has the same QHD+ resolution with 120Hz refresh, and goes up to the same 4500-nit brightness in HDR content and 1600 nits in regular use. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 has one of the best hardware packages you&apos;ll get on any device. The phone is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it comes with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. OnePlus didn&apos;t launch this model globally last year, so it is likely that we&apos;ll get the 16GB/512GB edition alongside the base 12GB/256GB model in most global markets. </p><p>The phone has the latest connectivity, USB-C over the USB 3.2 standard, NFC, and the usual set of audio codecs. What&apos;s good to see is that it has IP69 water resistance, which is a higher tier than the usual IP68 that we see in this category. IP69 protects devices against jets of water (both hot and cold) in addition to all the usual safeguards, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo&apos;s X200 devices</a> have the same protection. </p><p>Another upgrade is around the battery, with the device now coming with a 6000mAh battery. OnePlus is using a silicon-carbon cell to increase density, and because of the leather back and higher-density battery, the OnePlus 13 is actually lighter than the OnePlus 12. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 12 introduced a set of new sensors, allowing it to take much better photos than any other OnePlus phone to date. The OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP Sony LYT-808 main sensor, but it is joined by a new 50MP zoom lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. </p><p>The wide-angle camera on the OnePlus 12 was average, so it will be interesting to see how the OnePlus 13 holds up in this regard. Although the device is using the same main camera, OnePlus is making changes to its camera algorithms to eke out better photos, and with Hasselblad tuning intact, the device should deliver photos and videos with better details — I&apos;ll put this to the test once I get my hands on the device. </p>

<p>With the OnePlus 13 debuting in China, we don&apos;t have to wait long to know more about the device&apos;s global availability. It&apos;s likely the device will head outside China in January, but with manufacturers wanting to launch their phones earlier than usual, it&apos;s not unreasonable to assume the device will make its global debut in Q4 2024 itself.  </p>

<ul><li>According to recent reports, Gemini can be widely used in split-screen mode on large-screen Android devices.</li><li>The said devices can include foldable phones and large Android tablets.</li><li>The reports say the new window was seen on devices like Pixel Tablet, Pixel Fold, and Galaxy Tab series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Large-screen Android devices are primarily highlighted for their multitasking capabilities, which include split-screen views. Google's Gemini was one such app that supported split-screen views for Galaxy foldables earlier and is now expanding to many other such large-screen devices, per multiple reports.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/29/gemini-split-screen/">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini overlay window on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> now showcases a split screen button previously limited to Galaxy foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>

<p>Having Gemini in split screen view is particularly useful when you quickly want to research something on the other half of the screen while you might be reading, watching, or even hearing a podcast, for example. It lets you find out about something without leaving or juggling between apps, and it is super useful for large-screen devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> or other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/gemini-split-screen-mode-galaxy-tab/">SamMobile</a> also notes that Samsung's latest Galaxy Tab series also supports the split screen view for the Gemini app. When users trigger the AI assistant, they can now see an overlay window of the Gemini, which they normally do. However, the new button makes putting it in a floating window or split-screen view easier.</p>
<p>The latest addition comes after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assisant-actions-to-replace-gemini-extensions-on-android">recent transition</a> of Google Assistant actions, which are now run by Gemini. It would allow users to send texts on WhatsApp and Google Messages using Gemini — previously performed by Google Assistant actions.</p><p>Gemini integration has also been widely seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">recent times</a> across several Google apps, such as the Chat app, which got a summarize button as part of the latest update. Similarly, Gemini's popular "Help me write" was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-swooping-into-gmail-on-the-web-to-supercharge-your-email">recently ventured</a> into Gmail for the web, including a new "Polish" button.</p><p>Google is expected to roll out the next iteration of the underlying Gemini model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-2-dot-0-likely-to-launch-in-december-2024">in December</a>, according to reports. It will likely be dubbed Gemini 2.0 and become a successor to the current Gemini 1.5 Pro model.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it's bringing Google Wallet and tap-to-pay support to Family Link devices next year.</li><li>The functionality will let kids use cards and passes on their devices with parental supervision.</li><li>After first appearing on the Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch, it'll soon come to Family Link Android devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a long-requested feature to Android phones managed with Family Link next year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> for kids. The company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/30/google-wallet-kids/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> that starting in 2025, kids will be able to download the Google Wallet app on supervised Family Link devices, making contactless payments possible. Of course, there will be a handful of tools and limitations that give parents control of their child's activity.</p><p>For starters, the version of Google Wallet making its way to kids won't include support for online payments. Kids can make in-store purchases using Google Wallet's tap-to-pay feature, but can't buy things online. Additionally, parents will have to approve a credit or debit card before it can be added to their child's Google Wallet app. Every time a kid wants to make a purchase, they'll need to authenticate the contactless payment — just like on the full Google Wallet app. </p><p>Google Wallet for kids became popularized with the release of the Fitbit Ace LTE earlier this year, a smartwatch designed for children. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> supports contactless payments, and now, Google will bring a similar experience to more devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">managed with Family Link</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents won't have to manually approve every payment, but they will see a transaction history for their child's purchases. If something goes wrong, Family Link managers can remotely remove a Google Wallet card from their child's devices. In all, the experience will be similar to handing a child a credit or debit card — but with one less thing for them to lose. </p><p>Some functionality is limited; kids can't add IDs or use health cards, but they can use event passes. It'll also be a somewhat limited rollout initially, starting with the U.S. and select countries in 2025, with a wider expansion to follow. </p><p>“Following the positive response of tap-to-pay on Fitbit Ace LTE devices, we’re expanding tap-to-pay for kids to Google Wallet," Google said in a statement to 9to5Google. "The new experience is built with safety in mind, and will allow parents to supervise their kids’ usage – including approving new cards, easily removing cards and viewing transaction history.”</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed a performance update for Chrome that brings "Performance Detection" to the browser.</li><li>This arrives as an "Issue Alert" informing users of tabs that are soaking up too much memory and hampering the browser.</li><li>Google debuted Memory Saver in 2022 and this update adds three modes so users can control how aggressively it helps their PC's memory.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google highlights a few new updates web surfers can use in its Chrome browser.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Google is rolling out a "Performance Detection" tool that continuously seeks ways to improve your browsing experience. The company says this tool will appear as an "Issue Alert" near your account icon. When this alert appears, Chrome will state which tabs require attention.</p><p>Chrome will bring these alerts to your attention when it feels other tabs are soaking up too much memory.</p><p>Google states users can click "Fix now" and the browser will do the rest. Users can disable this tool by heading into their browser's Settings.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post states Chrome is receiving more personalization for its performance-focused features. Now, users can decide which websites should remain active (even when in the background). Indicators for inactive tabs and memory usage information when hovering can be disabled.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:731px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.46%;"><img id="g7v4gmEMgNQ7QoCCMg4RQJ" name="google-chrome-performance-issue-alert-example" alt="Google Chrome will soon show a "performance issue alert" for tabs that need to be deactivated." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7v4gmEMgNQ7QoCCMg4RQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="731" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding customization, Google highlighted three new modes for Chrome's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-active-inactive-tab-control-spotted">Memory Saver</a>." The memory-freeing feature picks up the following options: Moderate, Balanced, and Maximum. Each mode becomes more aggressive depending on how Chrome views the situation. Google states the "Moderate" mode will deactivate tabs based on your computer's needs.</p><p>The "Balanced" option will consider your computer's memory and your actions in Chrome while "Maximum" is much quicker on the draw to deactivate an idle tab.</p><p>Google has continued to focus on its browser's performance ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-performance-modes">Memory Saver debuted</a> in 2022. The feature was simple since it automatically drew memory used in other inactive tabs to those you were actively using. This was designed to improve the browser's performance <em>and </em>your computer as more available memory means your multitasking goes by without a hitch.</p><p>Additionally, the company introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-memory-consumption-per-tab">memory usage tab information</a> in 2023 to join its Memory Saver function. This gave users quick and easy to see which tabs were hogging up all their memory so they could discard them. The update Google is preparing to roll in for Chrome is likely one that removes visual clutter and helps users streamline their experience.</p>

Most of the time, this means a bunch of words and different numbers on a spec sheet without any benefits that we can actually see, but this time, it should be different. Some of these changes are going to make differences that consumers like us will notice.</p><p>Most of the changes are under the hood, and for things, we aren't interacting with. However, the companies making devices and the people building out software solutions are, and these should make a marked improvement in things like Bluetooth connection stability, data speeds, and overall device battery life. The one big change is called Channel Sounding, and it's all about providing true spatial awareness to Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new-in-bluetooth-6-2">What's new in Bluetooth 6</h2>
<p>Bluetooth 6.0 brings six new sets of features to the specification:</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Channel Sounding</strong>: This brings real spatial and distance awareness to Bluetooth. This unlocks a whole host of enhancements and new capabilities. We'll have a look at this in its own section.</p><p><strong>Decision-Based Advertising Filtering: </strong>This isn't about advertisements like the ones you see on a website or social media. This is all about how signals and Bluetooth LE packets identify themselves to devices. This feature allows a device to use the contents of a data packet received on a primary device channel to decide if it needs to scan for related data packets on secondary channels. If that all sounds Greek to you, it's OK. What you need to know is this will cut back on data loss, and when a device doesn't have to fetch the same data twice, everything is faster.</p><p><strong>Monitoring Advertisers</strong>: Again, this has nothing to do with product advertising. This feature allows a device acting as an observer (the one receiving the data) to filter out duplicate data packets from the advertising device (the one doing the sending). It includes built-in protections to make sure a host device knows when another device moves out of range, which could be a problem if multiple packets are filtered out. This will save battery and improve Bluetooth latency.</p><p><strong>Isochronous Adaptation Layer Enhancement:</strong> This allows larger sets of data to be broken down into smaller data packets for faster transfer speeds. It also includes a new mode to reduce latency based on PDU framing. This is as technical as it sounds, but it means that latency for LE connections can be reduced, and data transfer can be improved.</p><p><strong>Frame Space update</strong>: Before Bluetooth 6, almost all data packets were spaced 150 microseconds apart. That sounds fast, but sometimes it was still slower than it needed to be, while other times it wasn't slow enough. With Bluetooth 6, the timing between data packets is negotiable and can be shorter or longer than 150 microseconds. This will improve connection stability</p><p>A lot of this sounds very technical and I've tried to trim it down to its simplest form. If you're interested in the core mechanics of any of these features, the Bluetooth SIG has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/core-specification-6-feature-overview/">a great resource paper</a> with all the details.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth-channel-sounding-2">Bluetooth Channel Sounding</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA" name="pebblebee-clip-google-find-my-device-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip Bluetooth tracker compatible with Google Find My Device on a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding allows Bluetooth to be much more precise when determining where two or more Bluetooth devices are in relation to each other. Simply put, it means that two devices supporting the new feature can find each other across a wider area and <em>within a centimeter</em> of accuracy.</p><p>How it works is fascinating. It uses two distance measuring methods: Phase-Based Ranging and Round Trip Timing. These can be used separately or together and can achieve extremely accurate measurements.</p><p><strong>Phase-Based Ranging</strong> (PBR) uses the relationship between the phase, frequency, and wavelength of a radio signal. All signals have this relationship and PBR exploits it to calculate a distance.</p><p>1. The initiating device transmits a signal to the reflecting device.</p><p>2. The reflecting device echoes the signal back to the transmitting device.</p><p>3. The initiating device measures the phase of the signal it receives.</p><p>4. The process is repeated with a new signal, which results in a new phase measurement.</p><p>Distance is then calculated using a formula built on the frequency difference, the phase difference, and the speed of light. This is extremely accurate to a distance of 150 meters using a 1MHz signal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:20.89%;"><img id="h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f" name="BT6-PBR-calculation" alt="Bluetooth 6.0 PBR calulcation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1862" height="389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Round Trip Timing </strong>(RTT) measures the time it takes for a signal to travel from a transmitting device to a receiving device and back to where it originated. It's more simple and has a longer range than PBR.</p><p>1. The initiating device sends a data packet and records the Time of Departure (ToD).</p><p>2. The receiving device receives the packet and then echoes it back after a pre-determined delay.</p><p>3. The transmitting device receives the packet back and records a second timestamp called the Time of Arrival (ToA).</p><p>4. The distance is calculated using the difference between ToD and ToA with the predetermined delay calculated into the formula, multiplied by the speed of light.</p><p><em><strong>N * 299792458 m/s = X</strong></em></p><p>It also takes time to calculate the sending, timing, and receiving of a signal, which is determined by the hardware and inserted into the result, giving an accurate measurement of distance. This is very close to the way a dedicated ToF sensor in a camera assembly works to measure focal distance.</p><p>RTT can provide 100% accurate distance measurement, but the device hardware is unable to be perfectly precise, so there will always be a very small range of errors.</p><p>This is just a high-level but (hopefully) simplified overview of the technology.

<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding also incorporates several strong security features that help prevent distance spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. These include signal randomization, robust encryption, and the ability to cross-check signal path and distance between PBR and TFF measurements.</p><p>All of this makes Bluetooth 6 a much better solution for services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Find My networks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-locks">digital keys and smart locks</a>, and even your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-mice-chromebooks">Bluetooth mouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-expect-bluetooth-6-devices-2">When to expect Bluetooth 6 devices</h2>
<p>As of the time of this writing, no Bluetooth 6-enabled devices have been announced. The new specification was released in August of 2024, and all device manufacturers have access to the full range of features. That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> supports Bluetooth 6, so it may be only a matter of time before smartphone OEMs start incorporating it into their devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus unveiled its top-of-the-line Android phone in China early this year, breaking the December launch tradition. Now, the OnePlus 13 is already available for preorder in China, and it brings notable upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>The company's 2025 flagship packs in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Qualcomm's flagship processor. The SoC introduces a new Oryon architecture built on a 3nm process with significant singing at improvements over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It also makes the OnePlus 13 among the first phones to feature the latest silicon from Qualcomm, which was recently featured on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">Xiaomi 15 series</a>, also for the Chinese region.</p>

<p>Next to the chipset, the OnePlus 13 also has ample storage options with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of onboard storage. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> from OnePlus also uses a new upgraded Vapor Cooling system that promises better thermal conductivity.</p><p>For better gaming, the OnePlus 13 also supports 120fps gameplay support for large-scale mobile games. OnePlus is also introducing a new Bionic Vibration Motor Turbo, which should give you notable haptic feedback while gaming and while performing relevant system-wide tasks.</p><p>While the OnePlus 13's screen size isn't much different from the previous iteration, it does utilize a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">2K Oriental screen</a> from BOE—the second-generation LTPO panel measuring 6.82 inches with 120Hz refresh rate support. It's a mostly flat display, although with <em>slight</em> curves on each side. Also, for the first time on a OnePlus phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-specs-and-other-essential-features-surface">ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</a> under the display is a new addition. Previous models relied on optical fingerprint sensors.</p>
<p>The Hasselblad camera integration is again present on the OnePlus 13, which has a triple camera setup featuring a 50MP Sony LYT-808 primary lens, aided by a 50MP periscope telephoto sensor and another 50MP ultra-wide-angle sensor. The device also relies on a 32MP selfie shooter on the front.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 6,000mAh battery, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery introduced</a> by the company in June. It supports OnePlus's super fast 100W wired charging and 50W wireless fast charging. The company is promising to juice up the higher battery capacity to full in a mere 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the touch of AI is also seen on the OnePlus 13 across several departments, like the AI Assistant's ability to recognize what's on screen and answer your questions. There is also AI voice summary for calls, AI photo editing, and more. The device is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based ColorOS 15, which is, of course, confined to China, while the global variant will likely ship with OxygenOS 15.</p><p>The device also gets a nifty IP69 rating, alongside the conventional IP68 rating, which should now handle higher-temperature and higher-pressure water jets.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 starts at CNY 4499 ($632) for the 12GB+256GB variant and goes all the way up to CNY 5999 (~$843) for the larger 24GB+1TB storage variant. The device features three colorways: White Dew Dawn, Obsidian Sercrnet Realm, and Blues Hour (Translated). With the early China launch, we can expect the global launch of the OnePlus 13 to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
