                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google's new theft protection approach on Android combines prevention, resistance, and recovery all at once.</li><li>Failed Authentication Lock gets a dedicated toggle, giving users more control over how strict their security is.</li><li>Smarter lockout rules slow down PIN guessers without accidentally locking out real owners.</li><li>Identity Check now protects banking, password, and sensitive apps with biometric verification outside trusted places.</li></ul><p>Losing your phone now means more than just losing an expensive device. Thieves can get into your entire digital life, and Google is finally taking this seriously. Today, the company announced a big security update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and newer that makes your phone much harder for criminals to access.</p><p>Google is taking a new approach here. Android now focuses on prevention, resistance, and recovery simultaneously rather than only reacting after a theft. More importantly, these upgrades improve authentication, biometrics, remote controls, and even regional settings.</p><p>The lock screen is still your first line of defense. On Android 16 and newer, Google is making it stronger by adding more authentication options. The Failed Authentication Lock, which started in Android 15, now has its own on/off switch in Settings. This gives you more control over how strict your phone is when someone keeps guessing your PIN.</p><p>Google is also making brute-force guessing less effective. If there are several failed attempts, the phone will increase the lockout time, which slows down attackers. At the same time, Android won’t lock you out for repeating the same mistake, like if a child keeps tapping the same wrong pattern, so you’re less likely to get locked out by accident.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:575px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:151.30%;"><img id="3QY69XEDcnMWzrfKVnHk5R" name="Android Theft Protection features_small" alt="Failed authentication lock feature description in settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3QY69XEDcnMWzrfKVnHk5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="575" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="biometrics-are-now-your-universal-key-2">Biometrics are now your universal key</h2><p>Identity Check has become one of Android’s key security tools in 2025. It used to be limited to certain actions, but now it works with all apps and features that use the Android Biometric Prompt. This means that banking apps, password managers, and other sensitive tools now require biometric verification when you’re not in a trusted location.</p><p>For recovery, Google is improving Remote Lock, found at android.com/lock. You can already lock a lost phone from any browser, but now Google is adding an optional security question or challenge before the lock happens. This extra step helps make sure only the real owner can use it.</p><p>These recovery tools are now available on devices running Android 10 or newer, which includes most active phones around the world. This is especially important in places where people keep their phones for a long time.</p><p>Brazil is seeing some of the most interesting changes. New Android devices there now come with two major protections turned on automatically: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Detection Lock</a> and Remote Lock. Theft Detection Lock uses on-device AI to spot “snatch-and-run” situations and locks the screen right away if something seems wrong. Remote Lock also works even if you never set it up before. Your phone is protected from the start.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-2">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I really like where this is going. Having seen how quickly a stolen phone can cause financial trouble, I think these updates are practical, not just impressive in theory. It’s good to see Android treating theft as a system-wide issue rather than just adding a single feature. Identity Check alone is a big improvement, and when you add smarter lockouts and easier recovery, users get real peace of mind.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The USB-C port offers 18W charging, which isn't the fastest available, though it also boasts a durable design that's drop-tested for up to 3.2 feet. The USB-C port also supports two-way charging, while the device is compatible with a wide range of brands and devices, from Samsung and Google to Apple, and still more.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$25.99" data-dimension48="$25.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Travel-Ready-Technology-High-Speed-Output%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8C1pack/dp/B0D5CLSMFB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HBnpp2hLJTXCHPrEVyYJG5" name="Anker PowerCore Slim 10K render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HBnpp2hLJTXCHPrEVyYJG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1185" height="1185" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker PowerCore 10K Power Bank:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Travel-Ready-Technology-High-Speed-Output%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8C1pack/dp/B0D5CLSMFB" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$25.99" data-dimension48="$25.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$25.99</del> <strong>$19.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Portable chargers and power banks have been getting more affordable each year, though this $20 deal on the Anker PowerCore 10K is a worthy pick.

It weighs just 8.6 ounces and features a design that's perfect for laying most phones on top to let them charge wirelessly. Purchase also comes with an 18-month warranty.</p><p>Anker says the device is super sturdy, having been drop-tested for up to 3.2 feet. The company also points to its scratch resistance, as assisted by the textured housing. As part of the current deal, Amazon is also offering two of the units for a slightly larger discount, if you have a need for two. This particular deal is also available in either black or white.</p><p>To be sure, the PowerCore 10K normally sells for $26, which we considered a little on the expensive side at the time of release. With 23% off it comes down to just $20, which may make it feel like a little bit more of a justifiable purchase for those who are apprehensive.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is significantly higher than the numbers typically allocated to Samsung's special-edition foldables, suggesting the company may be planning a much broader release for this device.</p><h2 id="samsung-sets-its-wide-fold-plans-before-iphone-fold-lands-2">Samsung sets its Wide Fold plans before iPhone Fold lands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While exact launch markets remain unknown, producing this many units suggests it could see a fairly global rollout. As for specs, the report claims the Samsung Wide Fold will feature a 7.6-inch 4:3 inner display and a 5.4-inch outer screen. That would make it noticeably wider than the current Galaxy Z Fold 7 and potentially better suited for watching videos.</p><p>That said, all of this remains subject to change. We are still early in Samsung's 2026 foldable cycle, especially considering the Galaxy S26 series itself is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms">still about a month away</a>.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-7">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Samsung once again appears to be getting ahead of itself by trying to preempt the iPhone Fold. We have seen this strategy before with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which launched months ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a>. Both devices reportedly struggled with sales, and the Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">eventually cancelled</a>.</p><p>Samsung now seems to be repeating that approach with the Wide Fold, attempting to launch it before fully understanding how the market will respond, seemingly in an effort to capture some of the hype around a wider foldable phone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But Samsung has decided it’s time to break the mold. After years of perfecting these designs, the company has taken a bold step with a triple-folding smartphone that opens up to a tablet-sized screen. This new device, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, will launch in the U.S. on January 30, 2026.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold is Samsung’s clearest signal yet that it wants to redefine what a phone can be in 2026. Unlike the Galaxy Z Fold, which opens once, this phone unfolds twice to reveal a 10-inch screen that feels more like a small tablet than a regular phone.</p><p>If you’ve been watching Samsung’s progress with foldables, this step is logical. The company has spent several years working on better hinges, stronger displays, and smoother software. The TriFold is the result of that effort. It features a titanium hinge and a reinforced display coating to handle shocks. According to Samsung, the main screen can survive up to 200,000 folds, which is about 100 times a day for five years.</p><p>And yes, nearly three grand is the starting point.

Quite a bit. When unfolded, the phone is just 3.9mm thick at its thinnest point. It comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, a 200MP main camera, and what Samsung says is its biggest battery yet in a foldable phone.</p><p>Even more important, the large screen lets you take full advantage of all that power. You can edit photos, use several apps at once, or stream videos at full tablet size.</p><p>Samsung is also focusing on AI with this phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features are built into the interface, with tools like Photo Assist, Generative Edit, and Sketch to Image. Gemini Live offers real-time, conversational help that understands what you’re doing on the screen. Some basic AI features are free, but advanced and third-party tools might cost extra in the future.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-17">Android Central's Take</h2><p>From where I sit, the Galaxy Z TriFold is the most fascinating and riskiest phone Samsung has launched in years. It’s more than just a new device — it’s a statement. The big, multi-pane screen is perfect for multitasking and could even replace a small tablet for work on the go. The strong AI features, though still developing, aim to make complicated tasks easy. But the real question is whether people are ready to pay $2,900 for a phone, which is as much as a high-end laptop. This launch shifts the focus from simply making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> to asking what they can actually do. Samsung is betting that a triple-fold screen with smart AI is worth the price.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-OdBJQe"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/OdBJQe.js" async></script> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> unveiled a new feature called Personal Intelligence that aims to save you time by leveraging almost everything Google knows about you. It's opt-in, and users can tailor exactly which information Gemini can access from connections like Gmail and Google Photos. If you're a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscriber like me, you've probably been greeted with a "Supercharge Gemini with Personal Intelligence" pop-up over the last few weeks.</p><p>Personal Intelligence launched Jan. 14, and I've been asked to try Personal Intelligence a few times since then, with pop-ups appearing in the Gemini app on different devices. If you get a similar one, you'll need to make a choice: hit <strong>Not now</strong> to save Personal Intelligence for later, or press <strong>Get Started</strong> to dive in. You can always change your choice at any time, but should the average user try out Personal Intelligence or steer clear of it?</p><p>For now, I've made my choice — I'm keeping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/get-personal-geminis-personal-intelligence-uses-your-google-apps-for-answers-that-matter">Personal Intelligence</a> turned off. Or, at least, I thought I was. It turns out that Personal Intelligence is the evolution of Gemini's earlier Personal Context feature, and part of it is enabled by default. Here's everything you need to know about it, from the convenience benefits to the privacy situation.</p><h2 id="personal-intelligence-is-an-expanded-version-of-personal-context-2">Personal Intelligence is an expanded version of Personal Context</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WQz9myG7fMo5EUDGkCMQuK" name="Gemini-Personal-Context-2" alt="The Gemini Personal Intelligence feature on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQz9myG7fMo5EUDGkCMQuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Personal Intelligence is a supercharged version of Personal Context, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-personal-context-uses-old-chats-future-personalized-answers-update">a similar Gemini feature added about six months ago</a>. Unlike the former, the latter is enabled by default, but users can opt out. Personal Context uses past Gemini chats to create a personalized experience for future ones. It can learn things about you based on what you've chatted about in the past, including your likes, dislikes, and preferences. This is based on your Gemini Apps Activity, which can be managed and deleted manually.</p><p>Personal Intelligence is now the catch-all brand for Gemini's personalization features, replacing Personal Context. The functionality and memory-based features formerly known as Personal Context are now identified as <strong>Past Gemini chats</strong>. This setting has its own toggle on the Personal Intelligence page, but it's enabled by default (like Personal Context) — even if you hit <strong>Not now</strong> for Personal Intelligence.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN" name="google-gemini-personal-context-example" alt="Google's Gemini app picks up "personal context," a feature that lets the AI automatically pull important details about a person from past chats to use for future queries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the past, you could let Gemini learn from your prior chats and provide specific instructions for how it should respond in certain situation. Users could even add key facts for Gemini to remember in the Personal Context page; this functionality remains as <strong>Instructions for Gemini</strong> under Personal Intelligence today. The difference between the old and new Personal Intelligence features is that the latest ones personalize your experience <em>without</em> you needing to teach Gemini the information.</p><p>The new features are found under <strong>Connected Apps</strong> in the Personal Intelligence tab. By connecting Google apps to Gemini, "you can choose to have Gemini use insights about you from some Connected Apps to personalize your experience and help you get more done." For example, if you connect Gemini to Google Photos and ask for your license plate, it can scan your photo library to find the answer.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">works across Google Workspace apps</a>, including Gmail and Drive, and others like Photos, Home, Search, and YouTube. There are toggles for each one, so you can choose exactly which data sources feed into Personal Intelligence. Google notes that only your prompts — not your personal info found in connected apps — are used for training AI models.</p><h2 id="i-m-leaving-gemini-personal-context-on-but-keeping-personal-intelligence-off-2">I'm leaving Gemini Personal Context on, but keeping Personal Intelligence off</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub" name="Gemini-3-1" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although it's easy to be wary of giving AI more of your information, Google makes a compelling case in its Personal Intelligence <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for turning it on:</p><div><blockquote><p>We built Personal Intelligence with privacy at the center. Connecting your apps is off by default: you choose to turn it on, decide exactly which apps to connect, and can turn it off anytime. When enabled, Gemini accesses your data to answer your specific requests and to do things for you. And because this data already lives at Google securely, you don't have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience. </p><p>Google</p></blockquote></div><p>I'll paraphrase Google's explanation liberally here: it's essentially saying that you already trust the company to store your personal information, so letting Gemini tap into your connected apps adds no further privacy risks. It's not a bad argument, because companies like Google already know almost everything about you and me. Most of us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-you-should-care-about-what-companies-are-doing-with-your-clicks">surrender our precious data to tech companies willingly</a>, so we might as well make it actually work for us, right?</p><p>I can see the logic there. When you're trusting a company like Apple, Google, or Meta with almost all of your personal info, disabling a certain feature can feel like an arbitrary line to draw. Personally, I'm drawing my arbitrary line here, by declining to connect Google apps to Gemini with Personal Intelligence.</p><p>The reason why I won't use Personal Intelligence isn't because I don't trust Google; in fact, I trust Google services with my most sensitive data. Instead, I'd rather keep using Personal Context and Instructions for Gemini as I have been for months. With these tools, I can selectively provide information to Gemini when it's relevant, and avoid unnecessary data sharing when it isn't.</p><p>In other words, I don't find the idea of Personal Intelligence all that useful. I already told Gemini key facts about my life, like my girlfriend's name and phone number, using Personal Context. When I need to ask questions about a document, I'll upload it to Gemini, or better yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drives-new-ai-audio-summaries-make-pdfs-effortless">use the Gemini sidebar in Google Drive</a>. If I need to know my license plate number, I'll simply <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-google-photos-faster-response-times-rollout">use the Ask Photos tool in the Google Photos app</a>.</p><p>The minor benefit of having all these features under one umbrella <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-gets-personal-intelligence-about-your-gmail-photos-for-all-kinds-of-queries">in the Gemini app or AI Mode in Search</a> isn't enough for me to give the chatbot access to <em>everything</em>. At the end of the day, it's a call for each and every one of us to make ourselves. Only you can decide whether the convenience outweighs potential privacy concerns.</p><p>For me, I'm (mostly) keeping Personal Intelligence off, continuing to only use the features that have been around for months.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> launched with a 6,000mAh battery, followed by the OnePlus 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">15R</a> with 7,300 and 7,400mAh, respectively.

At least in the U.S., OnePlus has led the way to faster charging, with models reaching up to 100W, followed by Motorola, which usually hits up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W wired charging</a>. However, these speeds are much more commonplace outside the United States, where Chinese OEMs often hit over 100W wired charging on their flagship models and even some midrange.</p><p>This means you should be able to top up your phone in roughly half an hour or faster, depending on the phone, charging speed, and battery size.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung and Google are hitting up to 45W charging on their current flagships, which pales in comparison to their rivals. Thus, you'll have to wait a bit longer for a full charge; in many cases, an hour or more.</p><p>So, if you could have it your way, would you like more companies to focus on improving battery life or on faster charging speeds?

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">single-handedly making smart glasses mainstream</a> thanks to its partnership with EssilorLuxottica, the eyeglasses maker that owns the Ray-Ban and Oakley brands, among others. However, competing smart glasses brand Solos is now suing both Meta and EssilorLuxottica, alleging the two companies willfully violated multiple Solos patents.</p><p>Solos says these patents span "core technologies in the field of smart eyewear," including, but not limited to, integrated system architectures, multimodal sensing, beamforming, and audio processing. The company's court filing alleges that it "secured patent protection for these innovations years before [Meta and its co-defendants] began developing their smart-glasses programs." Notably, Solos is asking for damages "in the multiple billions of dollars" as a result of the alleged patent infringement.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed Friday, Jan. 23 in Massachusetts federal court. The filing claims Meta employees "studied Solos’ products, cited Solos’ patents, interacted with inventors, and gained insight into Solos’ engineering work" prior to making its own smart glasses available for purchase in 2021.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DvyS6hx86yeHSjVWgAzt6i" name="oakley-meta-hstn-meta-ai-app-garmin-workout-summary-01" alt="Oakley Meta HSTN AI glasses alongside the Meta AI app, containing a workout summary using data gathered from a Garmin smart watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvyS6hx86yeHSjVWgAzt6i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Separately, Solos claims Oakley staffers saw Solos' technology in 2015. Around January 2019, a pair of Solos smart glasses was sent to an Oakley former senior executive at their request "for evaluation purposes." Over time, the Oakley executive "gained familiarity with Solos' integrated eyewear architecture and open-ear audio approach." The lawsuit lists Meta, the U.S. business of EssilorLuxottica, and its Oakley subsidiary.</p><p>Solos' patent infringement case specifically refers to the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 1 smart glasses. Additionally, since Meta's other smart glasses "derivative of the Gen 1 platform," the filing alleges "ongoing and continuous infringement. Finally, Solos is asking for a court injunction preventing further patent infringement, which could affect Meta smart glasses sales — if granted.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta and EssilorLuxottica for comment regarding the lawsuit (Solos Technology v. Meta Platforms, 26-cv-10304), but did not immediately hear back in time for publication. We will update this article if we receive a response. A spokesperson for Solos told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/meta-essilorluxottica-sued-over-smartglasses-technology-2026-01-23/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> the complaint "speaks for itself."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="unUqp4D26HQ57ZmhTJTiDh" name="solos-airgo-3-smart-glasses-white-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Wearing a white pair of Solos AirGo3 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unUqp4D26HQ57ZmhTJTiDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Wearing a white pair of Solos AirGo3 smart glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Solos' lineup of AirGo smart glasses feature open-air speakers, artificial intelligence powered by ChatGPT, live translation tools, and an optional camera. Unlike Meta's smart glasses offerings, Solos' are modular. The temples attach to the lens frame with USB-C connectors. In practice, this means users can upgrade the temples or swap out the frame style without needing to buy an entirely new pair of glasses.</p><p>This filing is the latest in a string of lawsuits surrounding smart glasses manufacturers. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xreals-legal-battles-with-viture-head-to-us-shores">Xreal sued Viture in the U.S.</a>, following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-deals-blow-to-viture-with-patent-victory-and-german-sales-ban">a similar patent lawsuit in Germany a month prior</a>. Xreal says Viture's Pro XR glasses infringe on its patents, and is filing suit ahead of the expected XR glasses boom. The company's filing cited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-market" target="_blank">a research firm's claim</a> that the market will grow 6x in the decade. It could become a nearly $700 billion market by 2035.</p><p>Solos is making similar lofty claims about Meta's sales prospects in the coming years with its lawsuit. Solos says Meta smart glasses could generate $10 billion in revenue by 2030, based on current projections.</p><h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-smart-glasses-fans-2">What does this mean for smart glasses fans?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-versus-Gen-1-with-case" alt="Photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses sitting on concrete in the foreground, with the black Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Wayfarer sunglasses to their right and the official Ray-Ban charging case behind both sets of glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an emerging market like wearables, patent disputes are not uncommon. Over the last few years, we've seen medical tech company Masimo sue Apple over over blood-oxygen monitoring on the Apple Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman/ultrahuman-loses-delhi-high-court-dismissal-oura-lawsuit">smart ring company Ultrahuman sue competitor Oura</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/strava-drops-patent-suit-against-garmin-after-a-contentious-21-days">workout tracker Strava sue Garmin</a>.</p><p>Some of these disputes are solved very quickly with little consumer impact. Strava, for example, voluntarily dropped its suit against Garmin after a three-week spat. Others do affect the consumer market, like the Ultrahuman and Apple Watch sagas, which both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-wins-major-us-trade-case-against-smart-ring-rivals">included U.S. sales bans for certain products</a> — at least temporarily. Ultrahuman's smart rings currently cannot be sold in the U.S.</p><p>Solos is asking for a similar outcome — it is seeking an injunction that would prevent Meta from selling the allegedly infringing products. That doesn't mean the court will grant it, however. For now, Solos and Meta smart glasses will continue to be sold and operate as normal. This case will certainly have an impact on the future of the growing smart glasses market, as Solos is making strong claims about the current market leader's products.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's a thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1qn80sf/major_errors_on_pixel_10_after_update/">Google Pixel subreddit</a> that breaks one user's experiences down quite well. The user states they've encountered "errors" on their Pixel 10 following an update this past week. This <em>could </em>be the January security patch, but nothing's certain.</p><p>The user states Bluetooth "no longer turns on," and they're struggling with Wi-Fi. Specifically, their report says, "'Internet' setting freezes in the settings app. It'll eventually load, but not able to successfully turn on wifi or show any networks to connect to."</p><p>Other issues include the "Search" function in settings no longer working as intended, their device is unable to charge off "lower power" methods, such as a USB port on their table, and their Pixel 10's battery seems to drain a little quicker. Another report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/403411494?msgid=404363452">Pixel support community</a> highlights similar problems—but for a Pixel 8.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/404459360/wifi-and-bluetooth-refuse-to-start-on-pixel-10-pro?hl=en">user with a Pixel 10</a> attempted some troubleshooting: clearing cache, resetting connectivity, and booting in safe mode, but nothing has helped.

The patch arrived on January 13, and these patches usually take a little while to make their rounds and hit every device. The patch was (originally) seen in a bright light since it was finally delivering a much-needed GPU update for the Pixel 10.</p><p>However, days before that, users with two generations of Pixels (10 and 9) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/two-generations-of-google-pixel-flagships-seem-sluggish-after-update">were already reporting problems</a> after a Google Play Services update.

There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-aod-display-flickering-issue-december-2025-update">a long history</a> here that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">we can follow</a> together regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-arrival-soured-by-android-auto-unresponsive-issues-reports">the Pixel 10's struggles</a>, and Pixel struggles in general. At times, it feels like an otherwise well-made phone is watered down by the series of problems it often has. What's good here is that Google is, at least, aware of the problem. Now, users just have to wait for that fix to arrive. It's also not entirely clear how widespread these new problems are, but these reports are concerning enough.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, you can start a playlist on your phone and continue with the same queue on your tablet or in your browser. There’s no need to rebuild your lineup or guess where you left off.</p><p>For a long time, YouTube Music’s Now Playing queue was separate on each device. The Android and iOS apps kept their own lists, and web players sometimes pulled from mobile, but it didn’t always work. Switching devices usually meant starting with a new lineup and losing your groove.</p><h2 id="pick-up-where-you-left-off-2">Pick up where you left off</h2><p>That’s changing now. The service will sync your queue across all devices you’re signed into. When you open the app after using another device, you’ll see a label like “From your iPhone” or “From your browser” in the miniplayer until you press play. It’s a small touch, but it directly addresses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1jjq2it/why_doesnt_youtube_music_sync_listening_sessions/" target="_blank">common frustration for users</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.11%;"><img id="tqUD78sdBFPGFFrkssyWnR" name="YouTube-Music-queue-sync" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing queue showing the "From your browser" label" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqUD78sdBFPGFFrkssyWnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="475" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music prioritizes your most recent listening session, so your latest queue is the one you’ll see on other devices.</p><p>With queue syncing, YouTube Music now matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">popular music streaming apps</a> like Spotify Connect, which has let users control music across phones, browsers, speakers, and more for a long time.</p><p>This update changes how you use the app. If you switch between devices — commuting with your phone, relaxing with a tablet, or working on the web — you finally get a listening experience that truly continues wherever you go.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-27">Android Central's Take</h2><p>In my opinion, this is the most important update YouTube Music has had in years. It’s one of those "finally" moments that makes the service feel like a premium product. The biggest benefit for me is how much easier it makes my day. I can switch from a workout playlist to a focus playlist without having to search for the right track, which is a huge improvement. If Google can keep this momentum up, it might finally convince the die-hard Spotify fans that the grass is actually greener — and more synchronized — over here.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's report is light; however, that's likely on purpose (if true) because the Phone 4a has allegedly been certified overseas. Their post states the device appeared in the UAE's TDRA database. In it, the listing mentions the model by its codename: A069.</p><p>The folks at GSMArena highlight a previous discovery that claimed the Pro version of this device was marked as A069P.</p><p>While this database listing didn't divulge much information (they rarely do), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/11/nothing-phone-4a-alledgedly-adds-new-color-and-a-big-price-hike-leaker-claims/">9to5Google</a> once highlighted a tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/MlgmXyysd_bibilailai/2889">from Telegram</a>. That post alleged a Phone 4a and 4a Pro were on the way <em>and </em>that Nothing could stick with Qualcomm's more mid-range/affordable Snapdragon 7s series chips. Prices could range from $475 to $540 for the 4a and 4a Pro, respectively. The rumors add that the Pro version could be the only model to offer eSIM.</p><p>That tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/MlgmXyysd_bibilailai/2890">posted again</a>, claiming that the pair could debut in March 2026, which would line up with Nothing's last series.</p><h2 id="the-4a-series-in-en-route-2">The 4a series in en route</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-2" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFeKJ5VyrszQNLjDdupV7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Phone 3a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">sort of redefined that mid-range segment</a> for consumers last year. At the time, the company was hyping up its switch from MediaTek chips to Qualcomm, providing its devices with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>. It was a budget chip that had been optimized to support stronger AI capabilities and even better performance. However, there were tests that placed the 3a lower than the 2a in gaming and graphical scenarios.</p><p>It remains to be seen what the Phone 4a and 4a Pro bring to the table, considering it could feature the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-4-announced">Snapdragon 7s Gen 4</a>. That chip really went all in on flagship-quality gaming features and support, so maybe the device can strive higher this year. Pricing is a concern, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-ceo-says-smartphones-are-about-to-get-more-expensive">Nothing confirmed</a> that phones will go up in 2026 due to rising DRAM and NAND costs.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-32">Android Central's Take</h2><p>It's going to be hard to keep me quiet about this one. Mid-range phones are an anomaly sometimes. Either they're really good and can perform well, or they leave much to be desired. Seeing as the Phone 3a, in benchmark tests, was placed lower than the 2a that came before it, hopefully, Nothing is looking to do better. I certainly hope so, considering consumers opting for mid-range don't necessarily have to settle with "lesser." More than that, not less than what came a year before.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, it wants you to see how it works under pressure. The tech giant is doubling down on its partnership with fitness platform iFIT, moving past basic app integration to a full television showcase.</p><p>Through this partnership, the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> are featured in iFIT’s new endurance competition series, Trainer Games, now available on Prime Video. Last November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-ifit-partnership-with-galaxy-watch-integration-and-six-month-demo">Samsung teamed up with iFIT</a> to offer Samsung Health users on-demand workouts led by professional trainers. Including its devices in a competitive TV show is the next step in that collaboration.</p><h2 id="real-world-stress-testing-2">Real-world stress testing</h2><p>In Trainer Games, participants face challenges that test their pacing, recovery, and durability. The twist is that they use the same retail products available to customers, specifically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra, to track their performance.</p><p>Pairing a high-end wearable like the Galaxy Watch Ultra with the Samsung Health app offers more than just step counting. The system works as a digital coach. Viewers following the athletes on screen can access heart rate monitoring, detailed workout and recovery tracking, a running coach, an antioxidant index to measure intake, and bedtime guidance for better sleep.</p><p>The goal is to show that its Ultra branding means more than just marketing, and featuring the devices in an endurance-focused show might give Samsung a chance to prove they are tough enough for professionals and still easy for casual users.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-37">Android Central's Take</h2><p>I’ve watched many celebrity endorsements, but I prefer this stress-test style of marketing. Watching athletes use the Galaxy Watch Ultra in a tough setting like Trainer Games feels more genuine than a polished commercial. If you’ve been on the fence about whether the Ultra premium is worth it, seeing it survive these challenges might be the nudge you need. And I'm personally curious to see how that Antioxidant Index performs in a real-world training regimen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company might even integrate this look to more of its first-party apps.</p><p>Of course, things could still change before Google officially unveils Android 17 later this year, but given that the design has already surfaced in leaks, it seems likely this direction will stick in some form.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-42">Android Central's Take</h2><p>Google adding more blur across Android 17 does not come as a surprise. Many Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi, Oppo, and Honor have already leaned heavily into iOS 26-style translucent UI effects, so it was only a matter of time before Google followed suit.</p><p>That said, it does feel a bit disappointing. Material 3 Expressive finally gave Android a look that felt distinct, and while this is still very much Material 3 at its core, it is hard to ignore that the UI now feels more borrowed than bold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Over a dozen brands showcased new products at the event, and what stood out was just how much progress this category is making. Having used close to a dozen AR glasses over the last 12 months, it was exciting to see the likes of Even Realities G2 and Rokid's Meta-rivaling AI Glasses.</p><p>Then there's Appotronics. The Chinese brand will be familiar if you've used a laser projector in recent years, with its ALPD tech used in high-end models and cinemas. The brand is turning its attention to optical light engines for AR glasses, and showcased two new products: the Dragonfly G1 Mini, and Dragonfly C1.</p><p>The Dragonfly G1 Mini is interesting as it is significantly smaller than its predecessor, coming in at just 0.2cc. This allows AR device makers to roll out glasses that are thinner and lighter, with Appotronics touting glasses as light as 29g — half the weight of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1706px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.03%;"><img id="7BK8NgnS43qL3tqttx4gKZ" name="Appotronics Dragonfly" alt="Appotronics Dragonfly G1 Mini optical light engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7BK8NgnS43qL3tqttx4gKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1706" height="1280" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Appotronics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The engine is built on Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) tech, and the key benefit is that it delivers binocular imaging, so only one light engine is needed to power a pair of AR glasses. By contrast, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> uses a monocular light engine that's embedded in the right lens.</p><p>Another change is that the light engine is positioned in the center of the frame, and this again allows brands to deliver glasses with thinner overall designs or bigger batteries. I talked to Chen Menghao, General Manager of the Appotronics Innovation Center, and he indicated that the light engine is being used in Sharge's upcoming Loomos S1 glasses, which weigh just 29g.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="hLUeYDYizMdjoSQHVJqnQZ" name="Appotronics Dragonfly" alt="Appotronics Dragonfly G1 Mini optical light engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLUeYDYizMdjoSQHVJqnQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Appotronics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Dragonfly C1, meanwhile, is the first full-color dual-split LCoS design, and it delivers binocular AR display in full color via a single module. That in itself is a big deal, and Menghao talked about how demand for AR glasses is driving innovation into chromatic light engines. Whereas the G1 Mini uses a regular green LED, the C1 has RGB LEDs that enable full-color projection, unlocking a suite of new use cases.</p><p>While I'm yet to get my hands on the Meta Ray-Ban Display, I've been using Even Realities' G2 in the last two weeks, and I really like the fact that I can get notifications and relevant data without having to pull out my phone. The G2 uses a regular green projection, and I'm intrigued by how RGB lenses will make a difference in this area.</p><p>The key takeaway after talking to Menghao is how Appotronics is pioneering smaller optical light engines, and it's astonishing to see how much progress is being made in just a matter of months. That's always the case with a new category in general, and it's clear that AR glasses will see the kind of upgrades that we got with phone cameras over the last decade — I can't wait.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication claims that a Finnish retailer has published its Galaxy S26 series listing a little early, revealing something new: the base Galaxy S26 is updating its storage options. According to its discovery, the Galaxy S26 could chuck its minimal 128GB storage option.</p><p>The rumor doesn't allege that the device will settle with only one configuration. Two are still in the cards; however, the device may start at 256GB, and potentially a higher 512GB option.</p><p>Rumors add that the S26 Plus may remain similar (256GB, 512GB), as well as the Galaxy S26 Ultra with a 256GB, 512GB, and a 1TB option. This is where things get interesting, as other rumors suggested a similar possibility for the Galaxy S26. X tipster TheGalox_ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/2012393317258965294">also purported</a> a 256GB starting config for the model and a 512GB, but there's more: prices.</p><p>Since the storage has (supposedly) changed, the Galaxy S26 could start at $799. The Galaxy S26 Plus could begin at $999, while the S26 Ultra could start at $1,299.</p><h2 id="changes-are-rumored-but-not-really-2">Changes are rumored, but not really?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The storage sizes for the Galaxy S26 series have been relatively unknown. There was a rumor early last year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">that discussed the S26 Ultra</a>, which has been more or less reiterated in these alleged Finnish listings. A 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB option was rumored last March. So, in a way, you could say that it's "business as usual." Additionally, there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/2012722341457924528">was another rumor</a> about the Galaxy S26 series' battery capacities.</p><p>Tipster Ahmed Qwaider claims the Galaxy S26 could see a slight boost, rising to 4,300mAh with 25W charging. The S26 Plus could remain at 4,900mAh with 45W charging, and the S26 Ultra could see a 5,000mAh battery with 60W. The Ultra's rumored capacity has flip-flopped a little over the past year, so we'll have to see what happens during Samsung's launch.</p><h2 id="android-central-s-take-47">Android Central's Take</h2><p>If I'm honest—and considering what these leaks are really about—what's being talked about for the base model sounds intriguing. There's also the alleged starting price ($799), which lines up exactly where the model started out when the Galaxy S25 launched with 128GB. At face value, it seems consumers could get <em>more </em>storage for the same price. These are rumors, so I'm not jumping for joy just yet, but in a time where we're all concerned for rising prices, especially for our digital devices, this could be a good thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, Apple first made a name for itself in the consumer tech space with the iPod and iTunes, which were both compatible with Windows PCs in addition to Macs. Apple Music is following suit, as the music streaming service is now widely available on platforms like Android, Windows, Google TV, and ChromeOS. There's also a web app for Apple Music that can be accessed on virtually any device.</p><p>I've been a fan of Apple Music since it was called Beats Music before the Apple acquisition. Since then, the music streaming service continued to win me over, adding features like Dolby Atmos and lossless audio support while keeping prices low. I've acknowledged that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> and YouTube Music were better options for Android users in the past, but it's getting harder and harder to make that argument.</p><p>Specifically, Spotify's consistent price hikes and YouTube Music's missing support for high-fidelity audio make them tougher to recommend, even for Android users. If those two streamers aren't the best option for Android users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">their next pick might be Tidal</a> or Amazon Music Unlimited. Both are quality options that remain competitive with Apple Music. But I'd bet that if Apple Music were made by any other company, it'd be an instant Android hit.</p><h2 id="where-spotify-is-falling-short-2">Where Spotify is falling short</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify is the largest music streaming service, with over 700 million monthly active users and roughly 281 million subscribers as of 2025. It's a music streaming giant in every sense, with over 100 million songs available for listening and downloading. Spotify is also incredibly expensive, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-is-basically-telling-subscribers-to-switch-with-latest-price-hike">the company's most recent price hike raising prices by a dollar or more</a> across all of its subscription tiers.</p><p>Spotify was already one of the more expensive streaming services. The platform's individual plan now costs two dollars more per month than the likes of YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Tidal. Amazon Music Unlimited is $1 cheaper monthly for everyone and $2 cheaper for Prime members. It's a relatively small premium to pay, but over time, the extra costs add up.</p><p>People typically flock to Spotify for its excellent algorithms and recommendations. The platform's social features, including the famous Spotify Wrapped experience, are another appealing aspect of the service for fans. I tend to view these extras as both a blessing and a curse. While they're sometimes neat, others are unnecessary — like Spotify DMs — and add bloat to an already-overloaded music app.</p><p>I could ignore them, but the larger issue here is that Spotify is paying <em>someone</em> to develop and maintain these features. If my music streaming bill is $2 higher each month so that my music app is cluttered with another messaging inbox, I won't be happy.</p><h2 id="what-about-youtube-music-2">What about YouTube Music? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3744px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM" name="YouTube-Music-Podcasts.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Podcast filter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWw3aj876uNMGNtfwmv4iM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3744" height="2106" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Spotify is out, YouTube Music sounds like the next sensible option for Android users. YouTube Music is a streaming service that's hard to judge, mainly because it is bundled with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> for $13.99 per month. While you can subscribe to YouTube Music Premium individually for $10.99 monthly, the YouTube Premium bundle is certainly the better value. With that being said, YouTube Music Premium is an <em>outstanding</em> perk of subscribing to YouTube Premium, but it struggles to stand on its own.</p><p>Those who thought Spotify was bloated might be even more disappointed with YouTube Music. It now serves as Google's primary distribution channel for podcasts, cluttering the app. You can also find audiobooks on YouTube Music, since the platform taps into the YouTube database. This comes with benefits and drawbacks — you can find niche content that isn't available anywhere else, but you might also be distracted by it.</p><p>YouTube Music's willingness to cram artificial intelligence into the app isn't inspiring for music purists, either. Most recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-is-testing-ai-generated-backgrounds-for-lyric-cards">began testing AI-generated backgrounds for lyric cards</a>. Many of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2025-recap-has-a-new-ai-thatll-actually-talk-to-you-about-your-taste">YouTube Music's AI tools</a>, including this experiment, come off as unnecessary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC" name="YouTube-Music-Beyond-the-Beat" alt="YouTube Music Beyond the Beat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big reason YouTube Music's status as a serious music streamer is in doubt is its low song quality. I'll be the first to admit that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-lossless-audio-requires-this-gear-to-work">lossless quality is unnecessary without the right gear</a>. However, YouTube Music's mere support for up to 256kbps AAC or Opus is lacking even by lossy standards. It just isn't good enough, especially when it's missing Dolby Atmos too.</p><p>If you already planned to subscribe to YouTube Premium and are content with what YouTube Music Premium offers for free, by all means, keep using it. It's an excellent add-on to YouTube Premium. But until the streamer's sound quality and music features improve, it's impossible for me to recommend it as a standalone subscription.</p><h2 id="apple-music-shines-even-on-android-2">Apple Music shines, even on Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UC3Z6BVSwUMfXhPUAHTWgc" name="Apple-Music-Android-2" alt="The Apple Music app running on an Android phone showing hi-res lossless quality." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UC3Z6BVSwUMfXhPUAHTWgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's Apple Music, a fully featured, noncontroversial music streaming app for Android. The service costs just $10.99 per month while offering hi-res, lossless audio up to 24-bit/192 kbps (yes, that's higher quality than Spotify). There is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">Dolby Atmos support</a>, so you can take your pick of a lossless or immersive audio format.</p><p>Crucially, the app supports every feature Android users care about, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ap4NHrTJxyHCU9oSE7Byvc" name="Apple-Music-Android-1" alt="The Apple Music app running on an Android phone showing Dolby Atmos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ap4NHrTJxyHCU9oSE7Byvc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like that the Apple Music app isn't littered with unnecessary AI features or other media, like podcasts or audiobooks. It's all about music. There is a surprising amount of customization available, as the app allows users to manage animations, lyrics, listening history, volume normalization, crossfade, and audio quality.</p><p>Best of all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music supports importing libraries from YouTube Music</a>, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer, and Tidal. If you're sticking with Spotify despite the price hike over fears of losing your library, fear not.</p><p>I've been a loyal Apple Music user for a decade and probably won't ever switch. I can't say it's the best music streaming service for everyone. However, it does offer the best music quality and feature set for the price point ($10.99/mo). If you've avoided the streaming service because it's hosted by Apple, you might be missing out.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2effc96-3f4a-4aa0-9910-ab6f0b5a1655">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Bk52SDpN3SpaJi3Hfb44U.jpg' alt="Apple Music App Icon"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple Music</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A steal</strong></em></p><p>Apple Music offers hi-res lossless audio, Dolby Atmos support, and more for the same price as YouTube Music and two dollars cheaper than Spotify per month.

Instapaper, a popular read-it-later app, has confirmed its beloved Send to Kindle feature is moving behind a paywall.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Kindle devices</a> are known for their E Ink displays that mimic paper, but they aren’t exactly known for having a great web browser. Instapaper helps by letting you save articles on your phone and then sending them to your Kindle. This process was easy, convenient, and, until now, free.</p><p>The change is due to the work happening in the background. Instapaper’s lead engineer, Brian Donohue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/instapaper/comments/1qiypos/comment/o0vk328/" target="_blank">explained on Reddit</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-send-articles-files-or-web-pages-to-your-amazon-kindle-device">sending articles to Kindles</a> uses a lot of resources. Each time you request a Kindle digest, Instapaper’s servers process the text, collect images, save the data, convert it to a Kindle-friendly ePub file, and then email it to your device.</p><p>With over a hundred thousand people signed up for these digests — the vast majority of whom are on free accounts — Instapaper has essentially been running the service at a loss. By putting the feature behind a subscription, the company aims to cover those rising server and bandwidth costs.</p><p>Beginning February 19, you’ll need to pay for Instapaper Premium to keep using the wireless Send to Kindle feature. The subscription also includes extras like full-text search, unlimited notes, and a permanent archive of your saved items. The cost is $6 per month or $60 per year.</p><h2 id="will-kobo-users-be-affected-2">Will Kobo users be affected?</h2><p>Interestingly, this isn't an across-the-board tax on e-readers.

Kobo’s integration uses Instapaper’s API instead of the email system Amazon requires, so that feature will stay free for everyone.</p><h2 id="which-features-are-affected-2">Which features are affected?</h2><p>Instapaper’s Send to Kindle feature will soon cost money to use.</p><h2 id="when-does-this-change-go-into-effect-2">When does this change go into effect?</h2><p>Instapaper’s Send to Kindle feature will begin to be paywalled on February 19th, 2026.</p><h2 id="is-there-a-way-to-avoid-paying-2">Is there a way to avoid paying?</h2><p>If you don’t want to pay, you still have options.

Meta's text-first social media platform, which emerged as X (formerly Twitter) quickly fell into chaos under Elon Musk, hit a new milestone this month. Threads now has more global daily active users on iOS and Android than X as of early January 2026. As the mobile platform grows, making sure you — and your friends and family — are not accidentally sharing content to Threads from Facebook and Instagram becomes crucial.</p><p>These growth figures from Similarweb reveal that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of Jan. 7, 2026, while X had only 125 million (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Meta's official numbers are even grander. Adam Mosseri, the company's head of Instagram, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DNQuTFlCV9P?xmt=AQF0tIRGbOARi3Kd1ETdMP0kNwNnilI_rn_LmIW7dCvHsA" target="_blank">announced</a> in August 2025 that Threads had over 400 million monthly active users.</p><p>What's driving on this growth? Surely, Meta's willingness to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-threads-ups-its-game-with-new-controls-to-keep-trolls-at-bay">try new things and roll out new features</a> plays a role. Threads allows users to create longer posts without a subscription, offers communities for certain topics and interests, and comes with precise filters.</p><p>Some find the Threads algorithm to be too aggressive and reactive — liking or interacting with a post or two about a trending subject can fill your feed quickly with similar content. However, it's clear that Meta is building a new identity with Threads. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-cements-itself-as-the-antithesis-of-twitter-as-it-hits-175-million-users">not just a Twitter clone</a>, that's for sure.</p><p>With that being said, I'd bet there's another reason for Threads' successes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-cross-posting-account-center-highlighted">platform works within the Meta ecosystem</a>, and the social giant makes it easy to cross-post content from Facebook and Instagram to Threads. Cross-posting to Threads isn't enabled by default, but it may be too easy to do by accident, especially if the poster isn't tech-savvy. I've seen countless examples of people sharing way too much on Threads, and it's becoming a problem.</p><h2 id="how-meta-s-cross-posting-feature-works-2">How Meta's cross-posting feature works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="diVzBzQmTKX3Qx2mwUTxRF" name="Facebook-logo-with-gradient.jpg" alt="Facebook logo on Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diVzBzQmTKX3Qx2mwUTxRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of now, your Instagram and Facebook posts shouldn't be sent to Threads automatically. There were issues in the past causing these toggles to be enabled by default, with some users reporting cross-posting re-enabled itself after being turned off, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/C9xkuwXPdq2?xmt=AQF0T03FunVZSU-B6bhH0vBh1Hozt1o4y8pV_tlHjLCSQQ" target="_blank">according to a thread</a> started by Mosseri a few years ago. Those problems seem to be behind us, and Instagram and Facebook users will need to manually enable Threads cross-posting to use the tool.</p><p>When creating a post on either platform, there's an <strong>Also share on...</strong> setting that lets users control Threads cross-posting. There are two options: <strong>Always share posts</strong> and <strong>Share this post</strong>. They work as expected, with the former option sharing <strong>all</strong> future posts to Threads and the latter sharing just one. You can change this setting on Instagram or Facebook at any time.</p><p>There's a separate toggle available in the <strong>More options</strong> section of the Instagram or Facebook post builder. Under the <strong>Automatic sharing </strong>section, you'll find toggles for <strong>Threads</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong> (depending on which one you're using) that manage automatic cross-posting throughout Meta social platforms.</p><p>In other words, there are two ways to turn Threads cross-posting on in Instagram or Facebook, and both settings should be disabled by default. After it's manually turned on, though, it may be hard for users to recognize it — or know the consequences — if they're not an active Threads user.</p><h2 id="people-somehow-keep-cross-posting-by-accident-2">People somehow keep cross-posting by accident</h2><p>I know that people are posting to Threads via Facebook and Instagram by accident because I've seen it. Complete and unredacted names, addresses, ID badges, forms, and other types of identifying information have appeared regularly on my Threads feed. Pictures of family members, including minors, that were clearly intended for a close friends Facebook group appeared publicly on Threads — and were shared hundreds of times and liked thousands of times thereafter.</p><p>Last week, my suspicions were confirmed. At least on one occasion, this Threads poster below revealed that they shared identifying information unknowingly from another Meta platform. I've gone ahead and redacted the info, but you can see this poster shared a doctor's office form with autofill suggestions for patient names on Threads. I replied, and the poster explained they "posted on [Facebook] and [Facebook] goes to Threads."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r8xdfWth2UfGFGmWeujoxW" name="Threads-Crossposting-1" alt="An interaction on Threads." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8xdfWth2UfGFGmWeujoxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we know that's an oversimplification of what's going on here. Meta's cross-posting feature is opt-in. However, all it takes for every Facebook and/or Instagram post to cross-post to Threads is for someone to accidentally hit each of those toggles one time.</p><p>People are clearly finding a way, because it's not uncommon to see content that should've been sent in a close friends group appear publicly on Threads. If the person isn't an active user on Threads, they might not even realize they just shared their address, photos, or personal info on a public platform. Deleting content on the platform it was shared using<strong> does not</strong> delete it from the platforms it was cross-posted to, so users may <em>think</em> they deleted something that is still live on Threads.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-your-personal-information-2">What you can do to protect your personal information</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa" name="Instagram-hero-AC-2024.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is it possible that accidental cross-posts are boosting Meta's overall Threads userbase numbers? Potentially, though it's certainly not clear. The bigger issue is people mistakenly sharing information that really shouldn't be posted on the internet under the guise of "close friends" privacy.</p><p>To be clear, this is not Meta's fault. I do think it's too easy for a post to go from a closed-off group to the entire internet — it only takes a few taps — but users do have to enable cross-posting manually.</p><p>Still, this should be a public service announcement, especially for older crowds and those that might not be as tech literate. It's entirely possible that your friends and family members could be accidentally sharing private content with the Threads platform at large unknowingly.</p><p>Educate your friends and family members, regardless of age, that they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-to-remove-your-personal-information-from-results-on-google">shouldn't share any personal information online</a>. It might be worth pointing out the Threads cross-posting toggle specifically as a potential mistake to avoid, because I keep seeing people post private information online, and I don't like it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Motorola makes a few premium phones, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-reminds-me-that-i-dont-need-the-best">better known for its budget offerings</a>. Notably, the Motorola Moto G lineup offers smartphones priced under $300 that come with an incredible value proposition. They won't wow you on the spec sheet, but they're adequate for the price, and that's enough.</p><p>So far, we've already seen three Motorola phones debut in the Moto G 2026 lineup: the budget Moto G Play 2026, the midrange Moto G 2026, and the higher-tier Moto G Power 2026. All of these phones fall firmly in the budget category overall, with the cheapest costing just $179.99 and the most expensive costing $299.99.

Every phone, from the cheapest to the most expensive, is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset. That's good news for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-play-2026-review">Moto G Play 2026</a>, because it now uses the same chip that headlines both the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Power 2026. Between the upgraded processor and newfound support for 5G connectivity, the Moto G Play 2026 has a great foundation for the price.</p><p>Motorola didn't stop there — it also upgraded the display, which is still just an HD+ panel but now supports 120Hz refresh rates. The resolution won't impress you, but the smooth 120Hz refresh rates are certainly a welcome addition. The lack of uniform bezels also clues you into the phone's budget positioning. The Moto G Play 2026 has a noticeable chin with thicker-than-usual display bezels, at least by today's standards.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-1" alt="Moto G Play 2026 charging via a portable Anker charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLCkNfC9MkBfDxvxD5LZPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The smartphone also offers support for a few features you won't find on modern flagships. There's a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, but also a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio. You'll also find a microSD card slot on the Moto G Play 2026, and this is crucial because the phone ships with just 64GB of storage. The mere 4GB of RAM here is unimpressive, too.</p><p>The battery is another area where the Moto G Play 2026 keeps up with its higher-priced counterparts. You get the same 5,200mAh battery capacity as the other models, albeit with slower 18W wired charging.</p><p>All told, the Moto G Play 2026 is for those on the tightest of budgets. The single 32MP main camera, weak 8MP selfie camera, and other downgraded specs put it at a clear disadvantage compared to the other two models. Since the standard Moto G 2026 is only $20 more, it's easy to justify the upgrade to the next tier. However, if this is a secondary device or one you're buying for a child, you might not care about the deficiencies.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="223d805a-c561-418b-8b8d-8861dfda68d4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgnA3NaRP6aQV8ffkBGfuD.jpg' alt="Moto G Play 2026 render front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Play 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Budget pick</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 is the cheapest device in this year's Moto G lineup, adding key upgrades like 5G for the first time.

The two phones use the same processor with the same amount of RAM, and both run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box. They also both sport the same display, including the benefits (a 120Hz panel) and the drawbacks (only HD+ resolution). Additionally, the Moto G 2026 supports the same connectivity standards, the same IP52 durability certification, and the same 5,200mAh battery capacity.</p><p>In fact, there are so many similarities between the Moto G Play 2026 and the Moto G 2026 that they both have the exact same dimensions. The two phones each measure 167.15 x 76.40 x 8.44mm and weigh 202 grams. That just goes to show how little separates the two models. Luckily, the upgrade to the Moto G 2026 costs just $20 more, so Motorola doesn't have to do much to make this phone a good value.</p><p>Motorola does that by supporting faster 30W charging speeds over USB-C, which will come in handy when you need a quick recharge. Crucially, the Moto G 2026 also offers better selfie and rear cameras. The front-facing camera is an upgraded 32MP sensor. There are two rear cameras: a 50MP primary shooter and a 2MP macro lens. Truthfully, the 2MP secondary camera will likely be inconsequential, but the other two camera upgrades are notable.</p><p>The Moto G 2026 also ships with double the amount of base storage, 128GB onboard, with support for microSD card expansion. For only $20 more, it's worth buying the Moto G 2026 over the Moto G Play 2026 for its better cameras, more storage, and faster charging.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="25536128-7e6b-412d-8113-81c209548e3d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esFGxxNpfXbRrZUPJXZXWT.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Motorola Moto G 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola </div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A middle ground</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G 2026 is the midrange option in Motorola's budget lineup, retailing for roughly $200.

It's priced $100 more than the Moto G 2026, so what extras do you get for your money? Quite a lot, actually. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor and 5,200 mAh battery capacity remain the same, but almost everything else has been upgraded.</p><p>For starters, the display is a slightly larger 6.8-inch panel with FHD+ resolution (2388 x 1080) and support for 120Hz refresh rates. This makes the phone slightly shorter, but wider, than the other two Moto G 2026 models.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 is also a few grams heavier, weighing in at 208 grams. From a build quality standpoint, the Moto G Power 2026 offers IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress, which is a major upgrade over the rest of the lineup. The phone is offered in more premium colorways, too, including PANTONE Evening Blue and PANTONE Pure Cashmere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MHvVZWf2kyooyPP4ExwbFf" name="Moto-G-Power-2026-review-11" alt="Where Winds Meet on the Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHvVZWf2kyooyPP4ExwbFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Moto G Power 2026 uses the same chip as the rest of the series, it has double the amount of memory, allowing this phone to pull more out of the same hardware. This model starts with 128GB of onboard storage and can be expanded using the microSD card slot.</p><p>Motorola further upgrades the camera sensors, with a 50MP main camera and a 32MP selfie camera. The difference here is the secondary rear camera, which is an 8MP ultrawide lens that will be much more useful than the 2MP macro lens on the Moto G 2026.</p><p>Looking strictly at the Moto G 2026 series, the Moto G Power 2026 offers valuable upgrades over the field. However, compared to the last-generation Moto G Power 2025, the situation is more disappointing. Motorola didn't upgrade the processor this year and shockingly removed wireless charging, which is a tough sell. If you need the latest Android 16 operating system and an additional two years of OS upgrades, the Moto G Power 2026 might make sense.</p><p>Otherwise, you could probably get away with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>. This year's model is a nice upgrade if you're looking to use the Moto G Power 2026 as your daily driver. The extra RAM and ultrawide camera help it offer more utility than the cheaper Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. However, for those who don't need the best or want a secondary device, the Moto G 2026 is the sweet spot for $100 less.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abecb97d-1012-4da3-a607-13726d233ac6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still strong</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 might have too much in common with its predecessor, but it still remains a strong option within the Moto G 2026 lineup.

The phone is also available for pre-order in select European markets, including Germany and Spain. It comes in three color options: Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 made its global debut on November 13, 2025, and unlike the Magic 8 Pro, it is available for purchase in the U.S., albeit a little later than its initial launch.

It follows the familiar slab-style flagship design with flat edges and curved corners, but both the front and back glass subtly curve at the edges, making the phone more comfortable to hold.

As mentioned earlier, the Magic 8 Pro is currently limited to a handful of global markets and is not available in North America, including the U.S. and Canada. The OnePlus 15, on the other hand, is available across most major global markets.</p><p>If both phones are available where you live, then it really comes down to personal preference. Both devices offer some of the best specs and features you can get on an Android flagship right now and should comfortably last you for years. They both pack large batteries with extremely fast charging, capable displays, and solid multimedia experiences, so you are not missing out either way.</p><p>The real difference lies in software. If you prefer a cleaner, faster version of Android, the OnePlus 15 is the safer bet, though it is limited to four major OS updates. MagicOS 10 on the Honor Magic 8 Pro looks heavily inspired by iOS, and if that does not bother you, it is a compelling option thanks to its longer software support, with up to seven years of major updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="da7eff6c-0f39-4970-bd13-ebcd3bfacb72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmdVgt7s6xoaXZaLCwtXTg.jpg' alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Honor Magic 8 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A proper Honor flagship</strong></em></p><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is easily the most capable device Honor has released in a long time.

Unsurprisingly, AI creation and viewing tools were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/">one of YouTube's big bets for 2025</a> — and the platform is doubling down on the technology as we enter 2026. Notably, while YouTube also mentioned AI guardrails last year, the company plans to push back even harder against AI "slop" and deepfakes over the course of 2026.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tvs-biggest-upgrade-yet-puts-multiview-and-pricing-in-your-control">YouTube</a> says that its creators are "reinventing entertainment" as they produce studio shows and buy Hollywood lots to level up from user-generated content to something more. The brand also touted that YouTube Shorts average 200 billion daily views, and previewed other kinds of posts entering the Shorts feed. Secondly, YouTube is laser-focused on making the platform safe for kids and teens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/as-social-media-bans-for-kids-gain-traction-this-research-study-shows-theres-a-better-way">not excluding them from it</a>.</p><p>Then, YouTube reaches the elephant in the room, which is AI. It compares AI tools in video creation to the synthesizer, Photoshop, and CGI. Is that a fair comparison, or is AI a greater threat to the spirit of user-generated content creation?</p><h2 id="youtube-is-leaning-harder-into-ai-creation-in-2026-2">YouTube is leaning harder into AI creation in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6k35NCpzXBJdVWfud97E7Y" name="ask-gemini-about-video-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Ask Gemini about YouTube video on Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k35NCpzXBJdVWfud97E7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI isn't going anywhere on YouTube — in fact, it has been "the quiet engine" driving innovations and features on the platform for years, according to the post. However, YouTube seems to be taking a more measured stance on AI this year, acknowledging potential pitfalls and the need for transparency.</p><p>YouTube says more than one million channels used the platform's AI creation tools daily in December 2025. It's also helping creators in other ways, like content moderation for comments or age verification for viewers. In fact, YouTube has gone as far as to use an AI-powered system to figure out the best time to show a YouTube Shopping product tag in a video.</p><p>That's nothing compared to what YouTube is planning to use AI for later this year, though. The platform is teasing AI-generated YouTube Shorts that use a creator's own likeness. Soon, you might see AI-generated creators on your YouTube Shorts feed. Additionally, the platform will add AI-generated games and music experiments, all leveraging AI, to YouTube.</p><p>Still, YouTube promises that "AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement."</p><h2 id="youtube-is-taking-a-hard-stance-against-deepfakes-and-slop-2">YouTube is taking a hard stance against deepfakes and slop"</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ" name="YouTube-Labs" alt="YouTube Labs page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3854" height="2167" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there's still plenty of room for AI optimism at YouTube, it's nice to see YouTube acknowledge the real concerns about AI-generated content on the platform. Specifically, YouTube is reinforcing its commitment to transparency. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/ai/" target="_blank">requires</a> creators to disclose when realistic altered or synthetic content is shared on the platform, and YouTube itself labels content created or edited by YouTube AI.</p><div><blockquote><p>We require that creators disclose when realistic content is made with altered or synthetic media, including Gen AI Labels may then appear within the video description information, and if content is related to sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance, we may also display a label on the video itself.</p><p>YouTube</p></blockquote></div><p>YouTube is also evolving the existing Content ID system to help creators spot and manage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-rolling-out-likeness-detection-for-creators">when AI-generated content uses their likeness on the platform</a>. From the legal perspective, YouTube is supporting legislation restricting deepfake content, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-supports-the-no-fakes-act/" target="_blank">including the NO FAKES Act</a>.</p><p>Crucially, YouTube has an AI "slop" problem, and it knows it. By slop, we mean "digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence." It has a definition because Merriam-Webster named "slop" its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year" target="_blank">2025 Word of the Year</a>. That's how prolific low-quality, AI-generated content is on the internet today.</p><p>YouTube is taking a stand against slop, weighing its goal of offering a place of free expression against a need for high-quality content.</p><p>"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content," YouTube explained in the post.</p><p>From a viewer perspective, YouTube watchers can expect AI to continue impacting the streaming experience, with features like the <strong>Ask tool</strong> or <strong>autodubbed</strong> content.</p><h2 id="youtube-is-still-putting-creators-first-in-2026-2">YouTube is still putting creators first in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI is a touchy subject for creators, and for good reason.

These current tools are optional, and YouTube is taking critical steps to fight slop and deepfakes.</p><p>That should resonate well with creators. Perhaps the bigger point of impact for YouTube is that it continues to value creator content. It does an excellent job compensating creators for their work, and YouTube highlighted that by the numbers. It paid over $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over just a four-year span, and that's a staggering figure.</p><p>What's even more impressive is YouTube's claim that its creator ecosystem "contributed $55 billion to GDP and supported more than 490,000 full-time jobs."</p><p>If YouTube continues supporting creators, both by offering monetary incentives and by building AI tools that help them instead of try to replace them, 2026 should be another big year for the platform.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The foldable market has grown significantly over the years, with players emerging left and right and plenty of models to choose from. Google is already on its third foldable iteration with the rather impressive but iterative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but it is still ignoring a rather important form factor: the flip phone.</p><p>Since using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> like the Motorola Razr and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip over the past few years, I've often said that Google needs to throw its own flip phone into the mix. Google apparently disagrees, and the company seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/no-google-pixel-flip-yet">no interest in producing a flip phone</a>, but I believe Pixel Flip could be a great complement to Google's smartphone lineup and leverage the growing popularity of the Pixel family in a few ways that would secure its success.</p><h2 id="more-options-for-everyone-2">More options for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-Motorola-Razr-Plus.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5, Find N3 Flip, and Razr Plus side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3885" height="2185" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main reasons I want a Pixel Flip is that, despite the growing foldable smartphone market, options for flip phones are pretty slim. In North America, Motorola and Samsung are the only options, while Chinese OEMs offer more models overseas but are still overshadowed by book-style foldables. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> from 2023 was an impressive flip phone, but the company hasn't launched a follow-up since, even though it has produced two flagship book-style foldables in the past couple of years.</p><p>It's becoming clear that companies are much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-foldable-phone-failure-is-over-why-2026-is-set-to-change-everything">more focused on larger book-style foldables</a>, and it's not hard to see why. Companies can make much more from these phones, due to their higher average selling price. This is likely why we see Google focusing on the larger form factor; it can get more money back from each unit sold.</p><p>Still, in North America, where there are only a few relevant names in the smartphone market, having more choice among the available players is a good thing. Not everyone is willing to spend $1,800 on a smartphone, and a Pixel Flip would allow Google to still sell a smartphone at a more accessible flagship price while providing a third major flip phone option from a popular brand, alongside the Razr and Galaxy Z Flip.</p><h2 id="google-can-leverage-the-growing-popularity-of-the-razr-and-pixel-lineups-2">Google can leverage the growing popularity of the Razr and Pixel lineups</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quite a bit has changed in the few years since I last made the case for a Pixel Flip. Both Motorola and Google have become bigger players in the smartphone market, thanks to the Razr and Pixel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q3-2025">According to Counterpoint Research</a>, Motorola "emerged as one of the standout performers globally" in the foldable market during Q3 2025, after "expanding its foldable base through competitive pricing, strong channel partnerships and favorable product usability reviews." The company has seen impressive growth thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">successful marketing of the Razr series</a>, which offers a range of price points and attractive discounts.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS54017625">IDC estimates</a> that the foldable market will grow by nearly 30% in 2026, while non-foldables will actually see a decline. With the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a> later this year, Motorola is poised to reap the benefits of this surge by offering two different foldable form factors, something Google can and should consider.</p><p>It also shows why Google (and consumers) shouldn't sleep on flip phones. Since Q1 2024, Motorola has maintained double-digit market share in the U.S., remaining the third-largest smartphone brand by shipments, behind Apple and Samsung.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FAXWXmDPe5WLuMMrpMaq5j" name="google-pixel-10-and-pro-and-XL-and-Fold-jade-01" alt="All green colorways of the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAXWXmDPe5WLuMMrpMaq5j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while Motorola should be enough of a motivator, Google need only look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">its own Pixel lineup</a> to convince itself why a Pixel Flip could still work. These AI phones are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, with Pixel shipments <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-surprise-us-q2-2025-annual-growth-boost-smartphone-market" target="_blank">breaking into the top five in Q2 2025</a>, and the Pixel 10 launch resulting in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">massive surge in sales</a>.</p><p>It's clear that the Pixel is a hit, and while Google currently offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">four Pixel 10 models</a>, a Pixel Flip could easily slot among its higher-end models. Assuming Google keeps its smartphone prices the same and prices a Pixel Flip similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the lineup could look something like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Google Pixel 11: $799</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro: $999</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel Flip: $1,099</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro XL: $1,199</strong></li><li><strong>Google Pixel 11 Pro Fold: $1,799</strong></li></ul><p>This would position the Pixel Flip as a premium offering, allowing Google to compete with other high-end flip phones while attracting more users who may want the novelty of a foldable phone without the higher price point of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">10 Pro Fold</a> or its successor.</p><h2 id="what-i-want-to-see-in-a-pixel-flip-2">What I want to see in a Pixel Flip</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-17" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxa5kTNPN4Fj8awJgdBGP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Google decided to give us a Pixel Flip, it wouldn't be too difficult to imagine what this might be like. The design could resemble the current Pixel lineup with a mostly flat matte frame and glossy glass back, similar to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, plus a wide range of color options. The cover screen would expand across the top panel, as on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 7, with cameras protruding from the bottom corner of the external screen.</p><p>The Pixel can take after the Razr to let users use nearly any app on the cover screen out of the box, something most flip phones still don't allow. We've seen Google optimize the Android OS and apps for book-style foldables, and this could prompt Google to work with developers to better optimize apps for flip phone cover screens, such as continuity, resizing certain UI elements, dedicated widgets/panels, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-08" alt="Widgets on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the Pixel Flip would leverage Google's excellent software/AI and camera capabilities. Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">Look & Talk</a> on the Razr, which lets you glance at the phone while folded in tent or stand mode to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>. Google could use something similar with Gemini Live, leveraging what it's learned from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-set-up-gemini-raise-to-talk-on-google-pixel-watch">Raise to Talk</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> to let users jump straight into a conversation with its AI chatbot.</p><p>Google would also make the strongest case for keeping a dual-camera setup on a flip phone. Pixel phones have proven to handle digital zooming better than most other phones, and while many would like to see telephoto lenses on flip phones, a Pixel Flip wouldn't need it.</p><p>Basically, Google could offer the best of both worlds between the Motorola Razr and the Galaxy Z Flip, with a mature UI, strong software support, a functional cover-screen experience, versatile cameras, and more. Now that Google seems to have found its stride with the Fold series, it should shift some of that focus to creating the best flip phone it can.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company's finally ready with its permanent fix.</p><p>This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/thread/403765417/keep-calls-in-portrait-mode-in-the-google-phone-app?hl=en">Google announced</a> that it's starting to roll out that "control" for users to stop the Phone app from surprisingly rotating on them mid-conversation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/01/22/google-phone-app-keep-portrait-mode-on-calls/">PunikaWeb</a>). Google said in its post that the fix that's already rolling out should give users a way to stop the app's "automatic landscape mode" when on a call. What's started arriving for some users is a settings option called "Keep portrait mode."</p><p>The feature's name is pretty on the nose. Nevertheless, the feature lets users ensure that their Phone app keeps its contents in portrait mode, which aligns with how you'd typically hold your device.</p><p>However, alongside this new setting, Google says it's made portrait mode the "default" in the Phone app, per user requests. After the update has reached your device, you shouldn't have to do anything. All calls should remain in portrait; however, if that's not the case, Google walks users through some steps.</p><p>Users can open the <strong>Phone app > Menu > Settings > Display options > Keep portrait mode</strong>. Users can toggle this feature on or off, depending on whether they want a static portrait UI or one that will rotate. According to PunikaWeb, this feature is rolling out widely, so you should begin to see it soon.</p><h2 id="user-feedback-prevails-2">User feedback prevails</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37" name="google-phone-app.jpg" alt="google phone app listing on the play store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just before the holidays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-preps-a-fix-for-whats-probably-the-phone-apps-most-annoying-trait">user grievances with the Phone app</a> by Google surfaced, as many reports highlighted its unwanted rotation. What happened was users discovered that the Phone app was abiding by their "auto-rotating" setting, which applies to other areas of their device. For this, think about watching videos or turning your phone when browsing the internet. Unfortunately, when it came to the Phone app, it would rotate while taking a call, likely due to the tilt when placing it to your ear.</p><p>More than that, when the Phone app did rotate, it would split its UI into what resembled a split-view. It was jarring for users and did not sit well. It was reported that Google was testing new "controls" for the Phone app to help prevent this issue from happening. The "keep portrait mode" was spotted in testing from Google, and it seems that it's finally made its way to all users.</p><p>There was another feature spotted in testing, called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-may-soon-make-your-urgent-calls-hard-to-ignore">Expressive Calling</a>." If this feature makes it, it would give users a way to make their urgent calls hard to ignore, as they could set a "call reason."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature utilizes Gemini on Pixels, which is an AI that Samsung has pushed on its devices, like the Galaxy S25, when users turn on the phone for the first time.</p><p>Gemini's involvement is expected to continue; however, the highlight of this rumor concerns codenames the tipster spotted in Google's code. Allegedly, a recent update for the Phone app by Google provided glimpses into the devices to receive Scam Detection. The tipster states they discovered the following codenames: SM-S942, SM-S947, and SM-S948.</p><p>If you were to dig back into older Galaxy S26 leaks, these codenames reference the base, Plus, and Ultra models. The discovery of these device names here seems to suggest that Google is preparing a formal rollout of Scam Detection for the Galaxy S26 series. The tipster's rumor adds that the upcoming Samsung devices could contain this feature right out of the box, available to users immediately.</p><p>If <em>this </em>is true, then the publication theorizes that Samsung's next flagships could feature Google's Phone app by default.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-getting-in-on-it-2">Samsung's getting in on it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-06" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWNKtwfwBxmw69wGtikRAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Scam Detection <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">arrived for Pixels</a> as we approached springtime last year.

The feature leveraged a Pixel phone's on-device AI (Gemini) to "flag text patterns commonly associated with scams." Moreover, for calls, the AI would monitor "conversation patterns" to determine if you might be at risk of a scam.</p><p>Since this rumor is focusing on the calling aspect, it's likely (if true) that the Galaxy S26 would see a similar approach to guarding against scam calls.</p><p>On the topic of AI, there's been some talk that Samsung might utilize Perplexity's intelligence for Bixby.

The Meta Quest store became the Meta Horizon store, and free-to-play Horizon Worlds content was prominently placed in front of users instead of more traditional gaming content. The result was a substantial decline in game sales on the Quest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">backed up by tons of developer data</a> to prove it.</p><p>Many on social media are saying the changes are too little, too late.

"We're going to focus a lot more on the third-party content library and ecosystem that has developed there."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4" name="meta-horizon-app-mobile-games-with-meta-quest-3" alt="Mobile games in the Meta Horizon app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But according to several interviews I conducted after Meta's studio closures on January 13, 2026, Meta let go of several staff who worked with third-party developers and reduced funding to programs like Oculus Publishing. Bosworth wasn't asked about this topic in either of the Davos interviews, but has so far failed to comment publicly when asked on social media.</p><p>Heath's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sources.news/p/why-meta-did-its-big-metaverse-layoffs">interview with Bosworth</a> revealed that Meta is "still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we (Meta) hoped." We saw this trend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-are-eating-vrs-lunch-and-metas-2025-earnings-are-the-proof">begin in mid-2025</a>, although the Christmas holiday period <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-is-outselling-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-and-every-other-game-console/">saw the Meta Quest outsell</a> even the Nintendo Switch 2 on Amazon. Even with that success and the success of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/ug-vr-most-popular-meta-quest-game-michael-murdock-continuum-interview/">several new games</a>, Meta looks to be shifting priorities away from first-party development.</p><p>As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/2013099842529005912?s=20">said on social media</a>, "Oculus had a strong internal mandate to NOT be Nintendo and instead build things that build the ecosystem.  Returning to that is good." "This is not a disaster," Palmer followed up with. Meta "still employs the largest team working on VR by about an order of magnitude. Nobody else is even close." Time will tell if that continues to be a good thing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/401524051/star-in-your-own-memes-introducing-me-meme-in-google-photos">its announcement</a>, Google states that this feature is on its way to U.S. users, so keep your eyes peeled. It adds that Me Meme leverages its Gen AI software to turn your photos into "funny, personalized images." What Me Meme generates will be ready for sharing with others.</p><p>Headed for Create, Me Meme will, as previously stated, require a photo from you. Additionally, Google says that the feature will provide templates for users to choose from.</p><p>Google states that Me Meme will provide an assortment of premade templates for users; however, you can upload your own and use that as a base. After the feature arrives, users can head into <strong>Photos > Create > Me Meme</strong>. From there, select a template and upload a photo (an image of you is preferred). The image of yourself that you upload should be a rather clean selfie, one where your face is clearly visible for Google's Gen AI to operate.</p><p>Once the meme is done generating, users can share or save the image. Google Photos will have a "Regenerate" button available, just in case what it produced isn't up to par. There's also the addition of a "compare" button, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/16763021#me-meme">which is said to</a> "compare the uploaded photo to the generated meme."

The 2025 TCL smart TV even has onboard AI processing to adjust and upscale images in real time. </p><p>The Google TV OS also provides instant access to all of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv">streaming services</a>, plus you'll enjoy built-in Chromecast entertainment and support for your personal voice assistant, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> (naturally) and Amazon Alexa. Even if all of the onboard tools provided by the TV fail you, the QM5K comes with three HDMI inputs for your preferred devices.</p><p>Of course, no smart TV is perfect, particularly in this price range. The TCL set's local dimming feature isn't as effective as I would like, leading to a bit of a glare problem in certain light and from certain angles. If you want the best picture possible and can afford to spend a bit more, there are Samsung and Sony models that might be a better fit. But if you want to spend 300 bucks on a Google TV that usually costs much more, this Best Buy deal presents an incredible opportunity. </p><ul><li><strong>TV deals: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/tvs/3944_1060825_447913"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/all-tvs/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/tv-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/40E7E961-A3DD-4E8C-8B88-4274A840DF67?ingress=0&visitId=183fc793-0cec-425f-816d-4e9b1d420367"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/TV-Video/Category/ID-59"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Streaming deals: </strong><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><u><strong>Disney+</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.max.com/"><u><strong>Max</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.sling.com/"><u><strong>Sling</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://geni.us/YkQAuWd"><u><strong>Fubo</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/blackfriday"><u><strong>Peacock</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/"><u><strong>Paramount+</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Markey sounds the alarm over the deal's "lack of transparency."</li></ul><p>It's been a long road for TikTok and its potential U.S. ban; however, the app and the U.S. government have reportedly reached an agreement about its future.</p><p>Reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/tech/tiktok-us-deal-closes">CNN</a> earlier this morning (Jan 23) that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and the U.S. Government have agreed on a "Joint Venture." TikTok went into detaila bout this agreement itself, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/announcement-from-the-new-tiktok-usds-joint-venture-llc?lang=en">announcing the</a> TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. According to the company, this Joint Venture is primarily owned by the United States, meaning operations for TikTok U.S. (data, algorithm security, etc.) are in America's hands.</p><p>TikTok says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/">this Joint Venture's</a> "mandate" is to "secure U.S. user data, apps, and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures."</p><p>"National Security" is a major part of this, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/poll-results-should-us-ban-tiktok">has been centered in the spotlight</a> throughout this saga. TikTok states that Oracle's cloud environment will secure U.S. user data moving forward. The Joint Venture will also take another look at the app's algorithm, with the post stating retraining, testing, and updates are in the cards. Software assurance is another key point; however, the Joint Venture claims it will "safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm" name="tiktok-download-no-iphone-tiktok-logo" alt="Demonstrating the many ways to download TikTok on an Android phone while an iPhone sits face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The post adds that interoperability will bring TikTok U.S. toward a "global experience." It states that this Joint Venture will ensure that "U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale." With that, it sounds like business as usual for TikTok users. CNN cites comments made by President Trump following the deal's closure, where he expressed gratitude to Chinese President Xi Jinping for "working with us and, ultimately, approving the deal."</p><p>While a deal has been reached, facilitating the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-statement-on-tiktok-deal">sounding the alarm</a>. Per an official statement, Markey says the U.S., TikTok deal "raises many more questions than answers."</p><p>The senator adds, "Despite my repeated requests for information, the White House has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence. This lack of transparency reeks." Markey is also urging Congress to launch an investigation into the specifics of the U.S., TikTok deal to understand its intricacies and to bring about better transparency.</p><h2 id="tiktok-s-u-s-existence-was-topsy-turvy-but-now-it-s-here-2">TikTok's U.S. existence was topsy-turvy, but now it's here</h2><p>TikTok users will remember when the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">went dark early last year</a>. ByteDance informed users that TikTok went down on January 19, 2025 after a U.S. law went into effect to ban its services in the United States. TikTok started displaying messages to users about its services closing due to this law, but (at the time) President-elect Donald Trump stated that discussion might come into play.</p><p>Shortly after, work was already being done to return TikTok's services. The company said, "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service." TikTok came back online, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">went on to avoid a complete U.S. ban</a> a few more times.</p><p>We may still be early on in this deal. For now, it seems that life on TikTok will continue as usual for U.S. users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung says the phone can get up to 28 hours of battery life while watching videos, and it also features fast charging via USB-C and wireless charging.</p><p>To be sure, the S25 FE isn't meant to offer the best performance in the Galaxy lineup. Instead, it's one of the company's more budget-friendly options, though it still doesn't skimp on most of the features casual users need. Add in water and dust resistance, and the powerful suite of cameras, and it looks pretty appealing even at its normal sticker price.</p><p>The S25 FE normally retails at $710 for this configuration, which offers 256GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 512GB or downgrade to 128GB, but if this mid-level option seems like a good size for your needs, this discounted price might be all the justification you need.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$709.99" data-dimension48="$709.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$709.99" data-dimension48="$709.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$709.99</del> <strong>$509.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE to its lowest point yet.

For one, the lowered price point compared to some of Samsung's premium devices makes it a good entry-level pick.</p><p>Despite being closer to the economy-level price point, it still sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, 28 hours of battery life, and 256GB of storage (for this deal, at least).</p><p>Performance is backed by an Exynos 2400 CPU and 8GB of RAM, while it also includes a 12MP front-facing camera and three rear lenses.

Both companies make what's known as "XR Glasses," an evolution from smart display glasses that aim to put a giant virtual screen in front of your eyeballs anywhere you go.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-1s-brings-1200p-visuals-and-a-lower-price-to-the-best-ar-glasses">Xreal 1S</a> just debuted at CES, a follow-up to the excellent Xreal One released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">last February</a>. Its upgrades over Xreal One include a 100-nit brighter micro-OLED display, 2g lighter weight, a new real-time 2D-to-3D conversion mode, and a $50 lower price tag. But Xreal's biggest competition, Viture, is ready to spice the market up with The Beast, the company's first pair of XR glasses with a dedicated spatial computing chip inside.</p><p>That enables Viture Beast to perform native 3DoF tracking, something that was only previously possible with the company's Spacewalker software on a computer or smartphone. Viture Beast is $100 more than Xreal 1S, but it also packs in a camera and compatibility with the wider Viture ecosystem. Which comes out on top? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2 id="spatial-tracking-and-3d-conversion-2">Spatial tracking and 3D conversion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-side-lenses" alt="Xreal 1S and Viture Beast from the sides, showing the difference in lens tech when prescription lenses are installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Geij4t6EU8xDUnDpoutCoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I preferred Xreal One over <em>every</em> other pair of XR glasses on the market last year was its native 3DoF spatial tracking. Xreal 1S uses the same X1 chip as Xreal One and Xreal One Pro, so you can expect the same excellent, stable virtual monitor experience that those glasses delivered.</p><p>Viture Beast marks the first time Viture offers a pair of XR glasses with the same capability, but Viture's implementation isn't quite as reliable. To get the best performance, you need to have your glasses sitting undisturbed for 10 seconds after you plug them in for the sensors to calibrate. Xreal 1S doesn't need this to achieve the same stability. Viture told me it's working on better 3DoF stability, but for now, this area is a clear win for Xreal.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

Real 3D uses the X1 chip and an AI algorithm to convert <strong>all</strong> 2D content to 3D in real time at 30FPS. That means any game console suddenly becomes a Nintendo 3DS, and all movies and videos immediately have depth. All you have to do is enable Real 3D in the glasses OSD menu.</p><p>Last summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">I tested</a> Viture's Immersive 3D tech, which has been available on its glasses via the company's Spacewalker software. The results are impressive and run better than Xreal's Real 3D solution, but that's because it's running on a computer or smartphone instead of the glasses.</p><p>This also means Viture's Immersive 3D is more limited than Xreal's Real 3D, as it can only convert <em>some</em> content on compatible devices. Xreal does everything in-glasses, albeit at a reduced framerate, although Xreal says performance improvements are coming in a future firmware update.</p><h2 id="display-quality-comfort-and-fov-2">Display quality, comfort, and FoV</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-aspect-ratio" alt="Comparing aspect on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S running Hogwarts Legacy on a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bumkm3JBwefYxNcayvVa3W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's an area where things aren't quite so clear-cut. Starting with comfort, I've found that Viture Beast's display is more comfortable at high brightness, while Xreal maintains better comfort at medium to low brightness. Both glasses run at a 120Hz refresh rate with a 120Hz dimming rate. Viture's superior comfort at high brightness comes from the use of DC dimming, but the glasses switch to PWM dimming below 80% brightness.</p><p>Xreal 1S uses a hybrid of DC dimming and PWM dimming across the entire brightness spectrum. If you're not aware, OLED pixels are self-lit but always have to refresh their light every refresh cycle. Some companies use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> to manage this brightness change, but PWM dimming causes headaches, nausea, and other health problems in some people (like me).</p><p>I'm not sure I'd recommend either pair of glasses to flicker-sensitive people because of this. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/viture-luma-ultra-hands-on-and-limited-edition-cyberpunk-smart-glasses">Viture Luma</a> line is better, as they use DC dimming across the entire brightness range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-dimming" alt="Comparing dimming methods on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55d6FmjUM6XsfbJUnU4WvV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal is using traditional birdbath optics on the 1S, while Viture is employing what it calls "a hybrid approach combining both birdbath and waveguide." Viture's lenses offer a slightly wider FoV at the expense of some clarity at the left and right edges of the screen. Both Xreal 1S and Viture Beast support a range of prescription lenses. I've got my prescription attached to both, which you can see in the photos.</p><p>In general, I've found that Xreal 1S's display is better for productivity. Things like spreadsheets are simply clearer on the Xreal 1S, and text is generally more legible. Viture Beast's display offers punchier colors, deeper contrast, and slightly higher resolution at 1200p compared with Beast's 1080p. Viture will offer 1200p in a future firmware update, but for now, Xreal is slightly higher resolution because of the taller 16:10 aspect ratio.</p><p>I preferred using Viture Beast for entertainment purposes because of the color tuning on the display. Both glasses offer various color options, but Viture's punchier colors look nicest to me for games and movies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S with the electrochromic film maxed out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLGTTvxgZmiAcPN8Vqtv2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my testing, Viture Beast offers full 120Hz performance on its glasses, while Xreal 1S seems to top out at 90Hz. Viture Beast defaults to 60Hz, but you can quickly switch to 120Hz in the display settings menu on the glasses.</p><p>Viture's display is also notably brighter than Xreal, something that's often coveted for games and movies. But while the screen tech itself is brighter, Xreal 1S is actually easier to see in any lighting, thanks to a darker electrochromic film implementation on Xreal's lenses.</p><h2 id="a-wearable-monitor-2">A wearable monitor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV" name="xreal-1s-vs-viture-beast-maximim-screen-size" alt="Comparing maximum screen size on the Viture Beast and Xreal 1S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oFC7hq9v3VCTPDYNWtXwV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about the Xreal One line is that it offers an OSD menu like a proper monitor. Viture Beast now offers a similar monitor, and while it doesn't offer quite as many options as Xreal, Viture is planning on expanding this menu's options in future updates.</p><p>Viture also offers more buttons on the glasses, giving you more ways to quickly adjust things like brightness, electrochromic dimming, volume, and even display size. Xreal requires you to sift through menus a little more, and since it has half the number of buttons, you often have to cycle through options before finding the one you want.</p><p>Overall, Xreal offers better value and more stability than Viture at this time.

However, if neither of those methods works, the pairing process requires you to manually start again. That's now changing, as Google Home is adding a manual device search option.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-updated-device-setup-3634717/">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out an update that lets users manually search for third-party smart home devices directly within the app when QR-based or automatic pairing fails. The new screen shows a list of supported brands, along with a search bar that lets you quickly find your specific device and start the pairing process.</p><h2 id="google-home-now-lets-you-find-devices-manually-2">Google Home now lets you find devices manually</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.39%;"><img id="SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM" name="google-home-new-setup-process-search" alt="Google Home's new process for pairing a new device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SXGL2zvimiKY4rKiSjGgyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2580" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app now includes a new button called "Add a different way," which brings up a list of popular smart home device makers with a search bar at the top. Once you select a device, Google Home will again prompt you to pair it using a QR code or, if that doesn't work, manually enter the pairing code found on the device or its packaging.</p><p>The publication also notes that, for many devices, the new pairing flow includes images of the product you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-home-multiple-users">about to set up</a>.

Supposedly, Samsung has sought out a "new generation" of Gorilla Glass for the upcoming Ultra. At a hardware-level, it's been purported that this glass solves many issues that consumers typically reach for a screen protector for.</p><p>Issues such as reflection have reportedly been squashed with this new glass, as the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature "anti-reflective coating" on its display. This might also be paired with "CoE non-polarized light technology." This would not only cut down on how reflective the phone's screen is, but it would also boost its brightness, which is where many OEMs have ventured.</p><p>We'll have to see how these rumors pan out when the Galaxy S26 Ultra launches alongside its other two siblings this year. However, the tipster adds that this Gorilla Glass will offer "tempered protection," though that's pretty much what we've come to expect.</p><h2 id="looking-to-make-good-on-the-ultra-name-2">Looking to make good on the Ultra name</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fSU6vsKNzczPrs8QnZXijh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-S25-Plus-display-holding-02" alt="Comparing the displays of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSU6vsKNzczPrs8QnZXijh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other display upgrade (on a glass level) the tipster alleged was its "privacy film." Their post says this new privacy film will help reduce peepers trying to see what you're up to over your shoulder. This lines up with what we've been hearing for a few months now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-how-its-screen-will-hide-itself-from-snoops">and even recently in January</a>.

The device could debut with cobalt violet and pink gold as its only new choices. Allegations say the Galaxy S26 could launch on February 25, 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If nothing else, I don't have to be quite as careful about how I handle the products, and that's true of the CMF Headphone Pro.</p><p>CMF started out as a Nothing sub-brand that's focused on affordability, but it's now its own entity, and that clear focus on value hasn't changed — thankfully. The Headphone Pro is its latest product, and just like it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">Buds Pro 2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF phone</a>, the headset has an eye-catching design, and a slate of features that belie its asking price. The Headphone Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY/">costs just $79 on Amazon U.S.</a>, and it's just as affordable in India, where it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/cmf-nothing-headphone-pro-hi-res-ldac-100hrs-playback-40db-anc-5min-8hrs-charge-40mm-driver-bluetooth-wired/p/itm1649a193aaa4b">available for ₹6,999 ($76)</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VtZ8NvGGyKKCRKG54RYWkc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VtZ8NvGGyKKCRKG54RYWkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with everything else CMF makes, the Headphone Pro just doesn't look like a budget product. The design is meant to stand out, and it does that quite definitively — the Light Green model I'm using is great to look at, and if you need something with added flair, you can easily get orange interchangeable ear cushions.</p><p>That's the second part of what makes the Headphone Pro so distinctive: its modularity. You can switch out the ear cushions with just a twist, and CMF has plenty of styles that let you accessorize the headset with ease. I used several headsets in the past where it was possible to change the cushions, but it wasn't quite as easy as it was here.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="RCLHBTQJGXXZN294GUWFDc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCLHBTQJGXXZN294GUWFDc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4837" height="2725" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VSNaGZ9Cmu9qtMXFzD8yoc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSNaGZ9Cmu9qtMXFzD8yoc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="he4XSKMjgFunoBemH6nUic" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/he4XSKMjgFunoBemH6nUic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4405px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="6m7DRsTDnsAwGhk5EvHQic" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6m7DRsTDnsAwGhk5EvHQic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4405" height="2481" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The ear cushions and headband have good padding, and while the design isn't vented, I didn't feel uncomfortable even with extended use. The headset is on the lighter side at 283g, and that weight is distributed well along the headband. It's all made out of plastic, but the build quality is good, and I didn't see any problems in the week I used the headset. If anything, the Headphone Pro looks better than most high-end headsets I used.</p><p>My favorite feature is the physical controls; this is why I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing Headphone 1</a> over costlier models, and it's exciting to see CMF continue that trend. You get the usual power button and dedicated control to invoke Google Gemini, and there's also a volume knob, and a bass slider on the left. Look, I prefer a balanced sound, but I'll admit that it's just fun to be able to boost the bass on a particular track just by using a physical slider.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Lrem4LfUx5KbrLhbToguNc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lrem4LfUx5KbrLhbToguNc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5065" height="2853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="JhoNYwomG9yYAn7986gdrc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhoNYwomG9yYAn7986gdrc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5C9pDyNU2DSysJqXbLmssc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5C9pDyNU2DSysJqXbLmssc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5164" height="2909" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are other niceties included: you get actual ANC, and while it doesn't quite hold up as well as my Bose headset, it does an effective job in most situations. You get spatial audio as well, along with Google's Fast Pair, and even a low-latency mode. Basically, there isn't much missing on the Headphone Pro.</p><p>The headset charges via USB-C, and it gets fast charging as standard — a five-minute charge gives you four hours of music playback. CMF touts a 100-hour battery, but that's with most features disabled; realistically, you'll see around 35 to 40 hours based on your usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="P6w5WNmbM78LG7tcfSvDDc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6w5WNmbM78LG7tcfSvDDc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also a 3.5mm port on the left, and you can connect the headset this way if you just want to plug in (there's a 3.5mm cable included). CMF bundles a cloth carrying bag, and the headset folds flat, so taking it around in a bag didn't prove to be much of a hassle.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Headphone Pro comes with the LDAC codec, so you should get high-res audio on most devices; if not, it switches over to AAC or SBC. I tested the headset with my Find X9 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro, and I didn't have any issues with connectivity or range whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7DvYjqom9tJSdP2DWaWauc" name="CMF Headphone Pro" alt="CMF Headphone Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7DvYjqom9tJSdP2DWaWauc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the sound, the headset has custom 40mm drivers, and it has similar tuning as other CMF and Nothing products. The headset lends itself well to easy listening sessions, and while there's a slight bass exuberance, it doesn't bleed into the other frequencies, and on the whole, I really like how it sounds.</p><p>There really isn't a budget headset that sounds anywhere as refined as the Headphone Pro, and when you combine all the extras — the design, physical controls, and battery life — you're getting a product that's a downright steal. CMF is proving time and again that it knows how to deliver budget products you actually want to use, and the Headphone Pro is no different. I like it just as much as my Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, and the fun design, great sound, and modularity makes it an easy recommendation.</p><p>If you're in need of a new headset, don't bother looking at other brands — you should just get the CMF Headphone Pro.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fba0d4bf-45f8-40da-b025-febebbd1d73d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Headphone-Canceling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0FLK83CMY" data-model-name="CMF Headphone Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhJY56HrgVEU7gKa98wufC.jpg' alt="CMF Headphone Pro"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">CMF Headphone Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Headphone Pro looks and sounds better than any other budget headset I used, and the interchangeable ear cushions add a playfulness that you don't see in this category. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Newly leaked images of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> show a phone that looks almost identical to last year’s model, suggesting Google is sticking with a familiar design rather than trying something bold.</p><p>The newest renders, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-pixel-10a-official-looking-images-leak-in-more-angles/" target="_blank">YTechB</a>, display the Pixel 10a from all sides. At first glance, it’s tough to tell this phone apart from last year’s version. As per the leaked renders, it still has the same pill-shaped camera bar that sits flat, unlike the raised visor on the flagship models, and keeps the even bezels that are typical for the A-series.</p><p>The sides of the phone don't seem to be changed either. The power and volume buttons are still on the same side, and the other edge remains smooth and simple.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4rig8dL8imA3W5WF7Q78i8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="Pixel 10a screen and back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rig8dL8imA3W5WF7Q78i8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PyDAuLpqJAj6Jiwt3FM3h8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="right side angle of the Pixel 10a showing the power and volume buttons and the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyDAuLpqJAj6Jiwt3FM3h8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ajsrB3LKdaDHYzBMzn4Jf8" name="Google-Pixel-10a-leaked-renders" alt="right side angle of the Pixel 10a showing the power and volume buttons and the back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ajsrB3LKdaDHYzBMzn4Jf8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTechB)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="one-potential-upgrade-2">One potential upgrade</h2><p>Inside, not much seems to be different, but there is one detail to note.

The phone still has a 6.3-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 8GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage.</p><p>The battery is also the same, with a 5,100mAh capacity and 23W wired charging.</p><p>The camera setup is expected to stay the same, with a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide lens, just like the Pixel 9a.</p><p>Leaks suggest the Pixel 10a will launch on March 5, which is much earlier than the usual May release at Google I/O. The price should stay at $499, making the 10a a reliable but cautious choice for joining the Google ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The latter lets AI take over and tell callers you can't pick up, records their voicemail, and then transcribes it so you can quickly see what they said and decide how to respond.</p><p>While Take a Message sounds genuinely useful, it appears the feature has been behaving oddly over the past few months. According to reports, it may be unintentionally sharing your microphone audio with callers.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/22/pixel-phone-app-take-a-message-bug/">9to5Google</a> through multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1numbkh/pixel_5_people_can_hear_me_while_leaving_a/">Reddit reports</a>, when users rely on Take a Message, their side of the audio sometimes gets transmitted to the caller. To be clear, the feature is supposed to decline the call and record only the caller's message, not capture or share your audio, but that doesn't seem to be the case for some users.</p><h2 id="how-to-turn-off-take-a-message-for-now-2">How to turn off Take a Message for now</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37" name="google-phone-app.jpg" alt="google phone app listing on the play store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o5inagdzARJeYyuCLtsu37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The issue appears to affect Pixels across multiple generations, from the Pixel 4 series all the way up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-pixel-10-launch-live-blog">Pixel 10</a>, and the feature is currently available in regions like the US, UK, Ireland, and Australia.</p><p>Several users report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1qjhj5j/leave_a_message_feature_let_caller_hear_me/">seeing the green microphone indicator turn on</a> even after the call is routed to Take a Message, suggesting their microphone was active, and audio was being shared without their knowledge.

Google announces what's next for its in-depth AI Mode in Search.</p><p>Google introduced Personal Intelligence for AI Mode in Search earlier this morning (Jan 22) in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/personal-intelligence-ai-mode-search/">a Keyword post</a>. If you're familiar with what Google did with Gemini's version, you might know where this update's headed. The company teases that Personal Intelligence in AI Mode will help you "tap into your own personal context and insights to unlock even more helpful Search responses that are tailored to you."</p><p>This update concerns Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers as an "opt-in" feature, which is capable of linking AI Mode to your Google Photos and Gmail accounts. The post alludes to AI Mode's enhanced capabilities, as it won't simply "recommend" items based on interests alone. The company gives the example of searching for new sneakers. Since the user (in this example) had recently purchased a pair, AI Mode used that as fuel to find an alternative style.</p><p>Google offered another shopping example, stating Personal Intelligence in AI Mode will leverage your flight information (Gmail), as well as your destination, to find clothing ideas for you.</p><p>Traveling is another key highlight, with Google stating AI Mode will sift through your Cloud-stored Photos for captured memories from previous trips. If you've asked it to help you plan an enjoyable weekend away, it'll use that to suggest places you haven't been to yet or activities you probably didn't think of.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-s-wants-to-know-more-to-help-more-2">AI Mode's wants to know more to help more</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1074px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="gwHc9oerGR4K7b2DPZZmaK" name="google-search-ai-mode-trip-planning" alt="Personal Intelligence in AI Mode helps a user with a planning activities for an upcoming family trip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gwHc9oerGR4K7b2DPZZmaK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1074" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1071px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="TtCgGVMDgvcSpLccB9XkZK" name="google-search-ai-mode-personal-intelligence-clothing" alt="Personal Intelligence in AI Mode can dive into your Gmail for flight information and old purchases to help you discover clothing options for a trip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtCgGVMDgvcSpLccB9XkZK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1071" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>AI Mode is an extension of its Gemini 3 software; however, Google says the feature will not use what it's used from Gmail and Photos for training.</p><p>This echoes what was said about Personal Intelligence in Gemini a week ago. The post adds that users "remain in control" with this feature in AI Mode. As previously stated, Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature. If you don't want AI Mode digging around, you don't have to let it. If you would like to enable it, Google informs that the only data AI Mode takes for training is "specific prompts" and "the model's response."</p><p>Right now, the ability to let AI Mode look into Photos and Gmail is arriving via a Labs experimental function for AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. It might take a few days before these subscribers see an invitation available, so check on it periodically. If you do not, Google says you can hop into <strong>Search > Profile icon > Search personalization > Connected Content apps > Connect Workspace and Google Photos</strong>.</p><p>Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/get-personal-geminis-personal-intelligence-uses-your-google-apps-for-answers-that-matter">got personal roughly a week ago</a>, when Google first introduced Personal Intelligence. Gemini can do a little more, as users can grant it access to Photos, Gmail, YouTube, and more for assistance. The feature was similarly made available for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a cause for celebration. The legendary mobile provider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal"><strong>just launched a promotion called the "Family Value" plan, a new unlimited tier that provides a ton of benefits with up to $1,000 in annual savings</strong></a> compared to rivals Verizon and AT&T. </p><p>The Family Value plan starts at $140 per month for three lines, which shakes out to around under 50 bucks per line. In addition to unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's unrivalled 5G network, the new data plan gives you a five year price guarantee with an unlimited hotspot and free subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu. </p><h2 id="t-mobile-launches-new-family-value-plan-for-three-lines-or-more-2">T-Mobile launches new Family Value plan for three lines or more</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LyeCMKb3jYui876qcYpcrN" name="t-mobile logo square 1000x1000.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyeCMKb3jYui876qcYpcrN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>T-Mobile Family Value Plan:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension25=""><strong>save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&T</strong></a></p><p>T-Mobile is taking on the competition with a new plan that starts at just $140 per month for three lines. This family-friendly <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plan</a> is all about bang for the buck, offering comprehensive coverage with a bounty of entertainment perks, international benefits, 30GB of high-speed data, and much more. Will this move encourage the rest of the Big Three to drop their prices? We'll see, but if you're looking to switch to T-Mobile, now's the time.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/family-plan-deal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c4b372de-ff3f-4585-ba3a-131bbfde5c06" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="save over $1,000/year compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><em><strong>See all the best deals at T-Mobile</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking to switch to T-Mobile and can bring at least three lines; you want a phone plan with a ton of streaming perks and other benefits.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-prepaid-carriers-buyers-guide">cheap data plan</a> without all of the bells and whistles; you're looking for a single-line wireless deal. </p><p>In addition to the benefits laid out above, the new Family Value plan guarantees a new phone upgrade every two years with continued access to all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/best-t-mobile-deals-of-the-month">T-Mobile's new customer offers</a>. To earn the most bang for the buck with T-Mo's new plan, you can also take advantage of T-Satellite and grab some discounts on tablets and smartwatch lines. The plan will even get you a subscription to Apple TV for only $3 per month, in addition to free access to Hulu and Netflix. </p><p>If you want to bring your existing phone to the carrier, T-Mobile is also offering up to $800 per line to switch. In the never-ending battle of the Big Three wireless carriers, T-Mobile is clearly out for blood. </p><p>On the other hand, although it beats the competition, $140 for three lines isn't exactly cheap. I wouldn't recommend switching to the Family Value plan unless you plan to take advantage of <em>all </em>of the benefits described here. If you simply want a straightforward data plan with talk, text, and data for the family, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> that could get the job done for cheap. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Enough said. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6XoWWx6b57uqQWhZhsE3FN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6XoWWx6b57uqQWhZhsE3FN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's the catch? Well, the OnePlus 15 doesn't have Qi2 charging support, there's no alert slider, and the AI features are a bit lacking compared to other modern flagships.

Sending in the OnePlus 13 or Galaxy S25 Ultra, for instance, will only land you $300 and $400 of credit, respectively, while devices like the Google Pixel 10 Pro will earn you the max amount.</p><p>Needless to say, it's worth using Best Buy's trade-in tool to see how much you can get. Play your cards right and you could get one of the year's best phones at a budget phone price, AND $100 of free Best Buy cash to use on whatever you'd like. Not too shabby for a device of this caliber, if you ask me.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While you can buy an unlocked phone from great retailers like Amazon or Best Buy, the vast, vast majority of U.S. customers get their phones directly from carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, or Verizon.</p><p>Because of this behavior, companies like OnePlus that don't play ball with carriers often find themselves on the losing side of market share in one of the world's largest smartphone markets. Whether or not you believe rumors that OnePlus is winding down its global presence, it's clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-isnt-going-away-but-it-may-not-have-quite-as-big-a-presence-in-2026">the company's market share has dwindled</a> over the years.</p><p>Thankfully, OnePlus has publicly declared that it's not calling it quits. Still, I worry about the potential, as OnePlus has been one of my safe havens as someone sensitive to flickering LEDs and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. OnePlus is the <em>only</em> company in the country making <strong>flagship phones</strong> that adhere to IEEE standards for LED flicker, and it's starting to feel a little like doomsday for folks like me.</p><h2 id="those-of-us-left-behind-2">Those of us left behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-13" alt="PWM settings on Miyoo Mini Plus and display settings on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoDUXsxHeSJBnKw7QB3JdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few months ago, I was introduced to Harry Metzler, a musician based in New Jersey who has struggled with PWM sensitivity since contracting COVID in July 2022. After having to cancel a European tour for his band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://linktr.ee/IllAdvised">Ill-Advised</a> following its seventh album release, Metzler realised his new iPhone was impossible to focus on, and certain LED lights actually caused his left eye to involuntarily shut.</p><p>That's about the time he found out about PWM dimming, a dimming method used by some LED lights, OLED displays, and other LED-based gadgets. Instead of dimming like a traditional light source, where voltage is simply reduced to produce a dimmer light output, LEDs that use PWM dimming rapidly turn on and off several hundred times per second to fool your brain into seeing a brighter or dimmer image.</p><p>The result is often described as "seizure-like" or "concussive" symptoms in people who suffer from sensitivity. Metzler finds that his iPhone 13 is currently the most comfortable model, partly owing to that phone's reduced brightness level when compared to newer iPhones.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBNlC-VHN3o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Apple's iPhone 17 family launched a new PWM-sensitive accessibility setting that helps some PWM-sensitive users, but it's not a be-all-end-all solution. Some phones, like the Google Pixel 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-display-interview">have taken up a similar idea</a>, but the fact of the matter is that these brands have been slow to make even small changes, while brands like OnePlus responded to problems with robust solutions years ago.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15's display</a>, for example, is currently the most eye-friendly flagship OLED display you can buy in North America. The more budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">OnePlus 15R's display</a> is even better than that for flicker-sensitive people, and doesn't compromise quality to ensure all users can enjoy it.</p><p>But it's not just PWM dimming that's at fault, either. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">Temporal dithering</a> (TD) is another problem that's reared its head as 10 and 12-bit displays have become more commonplace, and it's causing just as many issues as PWM dimming for the same reason.</p><p>TD is a tactic used by manufacturers to artificially "deepen" colors on a display by flickering a pixel's colors back and forth, creating a color that doesn't exist by tricking your brain. This is often at 15-30FPS, the same flicker rate that causes epileptic seizures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Since my second COVID infection in 2024, I've been unable to use any Apple laptop," Metzler told me. The link between flicker sensitivity and COVID infection is something often correlated in the PWM-sensitive community, and I realized that my own sensitivity to PWM dimming also coincided with my first COVID infection. It's what led to led me to first write about how my phone was making me sick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">in May 2023</a>.</p><p>Metzler told me he realized his "eye twitching problem" was caused by dithering, which was introduced in a Mac OS update. He identified the problem by using a program called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.madrau.com/">SwitchResX</a> on his Mac, which forces the OS to stop using dithering. It helped solve Metzler's problem when using older Apple hardware, but newer laptops with M4 silicon no longer allow this setting.</p><p>OnePlus may not make laptops, but it does make several tablets and phones that don't employ dithering or low-Hz PWM dimming. It's a fact that means some users <em>must</em> use a non-Apple, Google, or Samsung-branded device, or be faced with debilitating health issues on a daily basis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-03" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XASQHE3tpRwjHQ3oKSWJZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Metzler told me, "I've talked to the Apple Store management, and they've put me in touh with corporate, but it's just this round and round and round and round thing. And, I'm at the point where, you know, we just kind of feel like there's no choice but to bring awareness to this issue."</p><p>The biggest problem with both PWM dimming and temporal dithering is that you usually can't physically see these things in action — which is the entire reason they're implemented in such a way — and that means most people simply don't know they exist. People get headaches and other pain from their devices and don't understand why.</p><p>The glacial pace of evolution from the largest companies is a bad fit for users with specific needs, and that's where a company like OnePlus comes in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.08%;"><img id="NnfDWvKLfcPHAFgVRCdnTU" name="OnePlus-and-Motorola-1" alt="The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 15 with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NnfDWvKLfcPHAFgVRCdnTU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If OnePlus were to exit the market — again, particularly the U.S. market — it would mean the only real alternatives for flicker-sensitive people are Motorola, Nothing, or one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">E Ink phones</a> that have entered the market over the past year. But none of those phones are flagship-level, and they all come with their own problems, as well.</p><p>Motorola doesn't offer some of its best flagships in the U.S., and Nothing has yet to launch a proper flagship phone. Each of the company's mid-range and entry-level phones is often great for PWM-sensitive people, but many of Motorola's LCD-based phones are a bad fit because they employ dithering. Likewise, while E Ink phones might be totally flicker-free thanks to E Ink technology, almost all use lower-end specs, at best.</p><p>My hope is that people like Metzler, who are stuck using Apple devices for job-related reasons, will soon see relief as companies like Apple and Samsung adopt tech from companies like OnePlus. We need these kinds of companies to stick around to serve potentially niche requirements, especially in this day and age, where daily life is quickly becoming impossible without a smartphone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ed6e4c99-7f05-40d1-b4e1-d083717d83fd">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QKqNQi3z8gp3kkpLrjtcKk.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>OnePlus</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Want a beautiful display that won't hurt your eyes?

The company introduced the feature in beta for New Zealand subscribers; however, today (Jan 22), that's going to change. In a press release, Spotify confirms that it's starting to roll out its beta for these unique playlists in more markets for Premium users in the U.S. and Canada "by the end of the month."</p><p>Once this arrives, Premium users can open <strong>Spotify > Create > Prompted Playlist</strong>. That's when the platform says your creativity and musical interests begin to shine. Users can describe what they'd like to hear, using vibes and scenarios as fuel for their lyrical, musical interests.</p><p>Spotify's Prompted Playlist will generate its results based on your description. Additionally, if you're vibing with what you said, you can set that playlist to refresh its contents daily or weekly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="uj9jLofPGUEq74DDUnoF9L" name="spotify-prompted-playlist-chill-example" alt="Users can write a description in Spotify's Prompted Playlists and find notes about the songs and vibes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj9jLofPGUEq74DDUnoF9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a little more to Prompted Playlists. According to Spotify, once you've described what you want, its software will use "real-time information" from the music industry. The platform wants people to think of "trends, charts, culture, and history" when it comes to what makes up the industry.</p><p>More than that, Spotify takes into account your listening behavior from the moment your account first opened. This feature will resurface your favorite artists, but it will also turn you toward newer sounds and creators to widen your musical knowledge. Customization extends to users telling Spotify genres it loves and genres it would rather not hear, too.</p><p>Spotify says you're never locked into one avenue with Prompted Playlists. If, at any point, you're interested in a refresh, Spotify says you can "edit your prompt at any time or start fresh whenever inspiration hits." The company reiterates that the generated playlist will create a "one-liner" about why it put a particular song in that playlist. However, if your mind's looking to chill, Spotify has included "Ideas" to help get you going.</p><h2 id="more-music-lovers-are-in-2">More music-lovers are in</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="Midj5ZzE2qEMAYpP2f6A4L" name="spotify-prompted-playlist-album-cover" alt="Spotify's Prompted Playlists will create a cover and short explainer about what it contains." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Midj5ZzE2qEMAYpP2f6A4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When this feature debuts in beta, users may notice a few example prompts on the app's home screen from music editors and experts.</p><p>While this expanded beta isn't expected to hit the U.S. and Canada until the end of January, Spotify says it's not closing out user feedback. With this expanded beta, Spotify is continuing its interest in listening to users to improve Prompted Playlists as much as possible before launching it fully. One thing is for certain: some aspects of the feature are bound to change, and Spotify may deploy "usage limits" during this test.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">used the Galaxy Z TriFold at the Dubai Mall</a>, and while that was a limited interaction, I was able to go hands-on with it to a greater extent at CES 2026. After using the phone for a while now, I got a much better idea of what Samsung is trying to achieve, and how the phone differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's tri-folding Mate XT</a> — which I've had for the better part of a year now.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold is on sale in South Korea and the UAE, where is costs anywhere between the equivalent of $2,500 to $3,200. Samsung is set to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to the U.S. sometime later in Q1, and estimates suggest the foldable will cost over $2,600 in the country, inching closer to $3,000.</p><p>Obviously, that's a lot of cash, and if you just want a foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 does all the things you need, and coming in at $1,649, it is a decent value — in the context of the TriFold. But if you don't care about the price and just need the latest in what's possible with foldable tech, then yes, you should get the Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung is only selling the foldable in limited quantities anyway, putting it squarely in the halo product category.</p><p>If you are considering the phone, I'll outline the reasons to do so, and where I think the tri-folding device doesn't quite measure up against regular book-style foldables or the Huawei Mate XT.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-reasons-to-buy"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Reasons to buy</span></h2><h2 id="the-tablet-sized-amoled-panel-is-great-to-use-2">The tablet-sized AMOLED panel is great to use </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's just plain cool to be able to take a phone and unfurl it into a 10-inch panel. That novelty doesn't really go away, and having a tablet-sized panel that you can use anywhere is just great. The AMOLED panel gets bright and it's just as good to use as the inner panel on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and I didn't see any issues with pixel density, color vibrancy, or brightness.</p><p>On that note, the outer 6.5-inch AMOLED panel is identical to what you get on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and it is just as usable. Initially, I wasn't quite sold on the idea that the outer panel moves to the back of the device when the TriFold is fully unfolded, but it is a natural way to unfurl the foldable, and outside of the panel getting a few smudges when using the device fully unfolded, there are no issues.</p><h2 id="there-are-no-issues-with-the-hardware-or-durability-2">There are no issues with the hardware — or durability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EipNTDQnPjdPmuxxLnxcxa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll admit that I used the Huawei Mate XT quite carefully because I was constantly worried I would break the outer panel, but because of the U-style foldout design of the Galaxy Z TriFold, the inner panel isn't exposed. This gives the tri-folding device much better durability, and the hinges are just as fluid as the Z Fold 7, and I didn't notice any inconsistencies with the hardware design.</p><p>Basically, the Galaxy Z TriFold feels just as long-lasting as the Z Fold 7, and it is just as thin when fully unfolded. That's another area where Samsung did all the right things; even though the TriFold is heavier at 309g, the weight is distributed evenly along the chassis, and it isn't noticeable. It is chunky when you're just using the outer panel, but again, not so much that you're going to regularly notice.</p><p>I also like that Samsung is using the same cameras as the Z Fold 7 — that makes the TriFold just as good in this area. And with a 5,600mAh battery, it should last at least a day. I used it for the better part of 30 minutes, so I'm not going to make any judgements on the battery, but it's great to see a big battery on one of Samsung's foldables. If anything, that's reason alone to get the TriFold.</p><h2 id="the-software-is-a-clear-winner-2">The software is a clear winner</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jcj9BCzMwizR8o83SBasKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest reason to consider the Galaxy Z TriFold is the software. It has the same great software as the Z Fold 7, and Samsung has features that let you maximize the 10-inch real estate. The productivity and multitasking features are better than what you get on most other foldables, and this is an area where Samsung has a lead.</p><p>It's also just as straightforward to use as any other Samsung phone, and this is where the TriFold wins out against the Mate XT. I had to do quite a bit of work to customize the foldable and have all of my utilities set up on the device, but with the TriFold, there are no such limitations.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-reasons-not-to-buy"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Reasons not to buy</span></h2><h2 id="the-panel-is-highly-reflective-2">The panel is highly reflective</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYDCtUxyAmTesEatH2N2Kb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I like the inner panel on the Galaxy Z TriFold, it is quite reflective — this is noticeable when you're viewing content on the device. I didn't notice it as much on my Z Fold 7, but the increased real estate makes it more evident on the TriFold, and that's something to consider if you're thinking of getting this just to stream TV shows and movies on the go.</p><h2 id="it-isn-t-as-versatile-2">It isn't as versatile</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LqoQjyE2mm7LNgH7AUajMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of contention is that the TriFold doesn't close into a traditional book-style foldable like the Mate XT. You get the outer panel, and then the inner panel unfolds to the full 10 inches. The design of the hinges means there's no way to close one side of the panel and use it as a book-style foldable much like the Z Fold 7, so you lose out on that feature.</p><p>I find myself using the Mate XT in this mode quite often, so not having that on the TriFold is a limitation.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="922tLzY9DVjVNeUPrZ9ACb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Testing the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/922tLzY9DVjVNeUPrZ9ACb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Look, deciding to go with the Galaxy Z TriFold isn't going to be objective — I can list all the pros and cons, but ultimately, this is a foldable that's close to $3,000; I understand that my thoughts on the foldable will do little to convince you to buy one. If you're undecided and need validation that the foldable is a legitimate daily driver and not just a tech demo, then yes, the TriFold should be your next phone.</p><p>Similar to other halo products like the GeForce RTX 5090, deciding to go with the Galaxy Z TriFold will come down to preference. If you're a tech enthusiast and want a phone that stands out from everything else available today, the TriFold is an unmatched choice. Or if you've used several Samsung products in the past and have an affinity to the brand, the TriFold is an easy draw. The tri-folding device is better than what I thought it would be, and whether you want to buy one or not is entirely down to you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google could even tie this into Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> design and automatically apply system colors to Search in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At the center of the update are two things everyone’s been asking for — a truly customizable multiview experience and cheaper subscription options launching in early 2026.</p><p>Multiview on YouTube TV has been around since 2023, originally launched as a way for sports fans to watch multiple games at once. Initially, it was locked to a small set of channels and mostly focused on sports, but last year, users could start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-is-bringing-custom-multi-views-and-a-redesign-to-its-tv-app">building their own multiview windows with non-sports channels</a> as well.</p><p>Now, YouTube's CEO Neal Mohan <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/the-future-of-youtube-2026/" target="_blank">said</a> the service is expanding this feature even more. Soon, you’ll be able to mix and match up to four channels on one screen, whether you want to watch news, sports, entertainment, or anything else.</p><p>This is great for households with different viewing preferences, like soccer fans and reality show lovers, or for anyone who wants to watch several games at once without switching apps.</p><p>The new customizable multiview shows that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> is giving users more control. Allowing people to choose their own layout may help the service stand out from traditional cable bundles.</p><h2 id="cheaper-options-are-coming-2">Cheaper options are coming</h2><p>YouTube TV is also changing its pricing and plans. Instead of one large plan for everyone, it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/choice-arrives-with-youtube-tv-plans-early-next-year-but-heres-the-sports-plan">offer over 10 different packages</a> based on genres, starting early next year.</p><p>Currently, the base plan costs about $82.99 per month and includes over 100 channels, unlimited DVR, and features like multiview and key plays. However, some people have criticized this all-or-nothing approach, especially as streaming prices rise.</p><p>The new genre-based plans aim to solve this problem. You’ll be able to choose bundles focused on sports, news, family, or entertainment.</p><p>YouTube hasn’t shared exact prices yet, but early leaks suggest these packages will likely cost much less than the full base plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the original post, this anti-rollback procedure or "fuse" applies to OnePlus phones featuring a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. More specifically, this applies to the company's recent v16.0.3.501 ColorOS update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13</a>, 13T, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">15</a>.</p><p>The user details a few "consequences" for attempting a downgrade or rollback. Their post states that this OS update makes it impossible for users to rollback, as their device will undergo a "hard brick." This will reportedly occur if the user tries to flash a previous version of ColorOS, OxygenOS, or even a custom ROM.</p><p>Custom ROMs are the other side of this, which, while it doesn't affect a majority of Android users, some get down with the ROMs. The user reports that after the 16.0.3.501 ColorOS update, flashing any ROM will brick your device, and "you cannot unbrick" the phone. The thread highlights one OnePlus 13 user who had to obtain a new motherboard just to be able to use their device again.</p><p>The developer suggests dodging the 16.0.3.501 update if your device receives it. Of course, this only applies to users who actively use custom ROMs and may be interested in rollbacks, but this is where things get hazy. The developer reports that this anti-rollback mechanism has only been applied to OnePlus' ColorOS, not newer OxygenOS versions. Users overseas, such as in the U.S., will have the latter, but there's nothing that says OnePlus isn't going to apply this mechanism to OxygenOS, too.</p><h2 id="changes-at-oneplus-2">Changes at OnePlus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xnKkvqZJtcrkRNJEqCU93b" name="oneplus-15-display-home-screen-01" alt="A customized home screen UI on the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xnKkvqZJtcrkRNJEqCU93b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus has been all over the headlines recently, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/allegations-claim-the-oneplus-16-might-give-global-markets-the-cold-shoulder">there was one rumor</a> about its upcoming 16 flagship model.

On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RobinLiuOnePlus/status/2013829249690751486">social media</a>, the company's CEO of OnePlus India, Robin Liu, said, "I wanted to address some misinformation that has been circulating about OnePlus India and its operations.  We’re operating as usual and will continue to do so. Never Settle." It also seems as though OnePlus is restructuring its mentality, looking toward a future where it shies away from multiple launches to focus on "crucial devices."</p> ]]></dc:content>
