<p>Wireless charging isn't the most efficient method of recharging anything. Most wireless chargers tend to run super hot, which is unsafe and wastes energy at the same time. Accessory brand TORRAS has a solution to combat this unnecessary heat generation. The brand's PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger has a built-in cooling fan, keeping your device nice and breezy.</p><p>TORRAS started out as a smartphone case maker, but the Chinese brand has since expanded into other accessories, such as phone stands, grips, chargers, and even power banks. The design language is minimal across the portfolio, with many concepts reminiscent of ESR's offerings.</p>

<p>The PolarCircle is meant to be a jack of all trades, combining 15W Qi2 wireless charging with a cooling fan and a rotating phone stand. You can even use the sturdy rotating stand as a grip since it boasts a ring-like structure. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/qi2">Qi2</a> accessory, it works with MagSafe devices perfectly as well.</p><p>I was expecting a plug-and-play experience with the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger. As a person who spends six out of seven days a week—sometimes even all seven — testing accessories, it took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure this thing out.</p><p>Fortunately, the fine print on the tiny little user manual walks you through the steps with illustrated diagrams. I still feel like TORRAS needs to uncomplicate the process of turning on the cooling fan. It's not user-friendly at all, requiring you to press and hold the button, unplug and then replug the cable to get the blades spinning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sp46TnQHiReJzgbrkxB7Rc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wireless charging works as it should with the TORRAS PolarCircle, functioning smoothly with both Android and iOS devices during my review. The cooling fan does an amicable job of heat reduction, keeping the center of the device frosty. This prevents stutters and overheating issues on your phone, so you can use it while charging.</p><p>It's not the "coolest" accessory I have ever used, though. That award goes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Black-Shark-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B09CGTLDB7/">Black Shark's magnetic coolers</a>. However, the TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger's temperature control is adequate for wireless charging purposes.</p><p>The charger is built well, and even though the ring-like stand is thin, it feels durable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc" name="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" alt="TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gKAksDf4UHcDnRKz87GBc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3766" height="2118" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TORRAS includes a 5-foot-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C to USB-C cable</a> in the box, which is a pleasing length. That's a generously long cable — competitors, please take note. We don't want measly little 2ft cables, which is what most brands like Anker provide. This is the gold standard of cable lengths.</p><p>Overall, the $59.99 price tag gives you excellent value for your money. TORRAS frequently discounts its products, so you can easily score the PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger for less than $50. At the time of writing, you can get it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV/">$42.49 from Amazon</a>.</p><p>I don't think you can expect a multipurpose accessory like this to be any cheaper. It's a fantastic deal, considering good-quality coolers set you back $30 to $40 alone. Add the cost of a 15W Qi2 wireless charger and a MagSafe PopSocket, and you're already looking at a hefty bill, with the combined total reaching $100 if you add a 5ft USB-C cable.</p><p>So, if your phone tends to overheat while charging, try the budget-friendly TORRAS PolarCircle Qi2 Wireless Charger!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used a half-dozen open earbuds until now, and I like these products; they somehow manage to deliver a rich and detailed sound with energetic bass — all without nestling inside the ear cavity. While there are several styles and designs in this emerging category, most manufacturers went with an ear hook design to position the audio driver just outside the ear cavity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJGhsFRrS42dnXwqjH3XCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SoundPEATS is taking a different direction. Its PearlClip Pro earbuds have a unique design that clips over the ears, and it somehow works. The design means it will be disorientating when you start using the earbuds — it took me a while to understand how to wear these correctly — but once they're nestled in your ears, they're pretty comfortable. These buds usually cost $69, but they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.amazon.com/SoundPEATS-Ear-Earbuds-Headphones-Clip/dp/B0DLNYJ3YR">now on sale for just $42</a>, and that's a great value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JMUPioFJAiGRNKYvVJaZ9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most open earbuds, the PearlClip Pro nestle into the ear canal a little, but they're still much better in this area than regular earbuds. Coming in at 5.85g, they're on the lighter end of the scale, but I noticed a little strain around the lower portion of my ear lobe after wearing these buds for an extended amount of time. The fit does take some getting used to, and I'd recommend trying out the earbuds to see if you like the way they nestle around the ear.</p>

<p>The unique way they're positioned around the ear means they look a little goofy at times, and in the two times I walked around with these on, I got quite a lot of stares. Interestingly, the earbuds don't have traditional left/right channels — they're interchangeable. The only other audio product I used that had this design was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/meze-99-classics-review">Meze 99 Classics</a>, so you don't have to worry if you're wearing the correct earbud in each ear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrNND7xwEABZ9VDQcis7CM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound is pretty good; it has a 12mm driver and weighty bass along with a cleanly defined mid-range and articulated highs, and I didn't see any issues when listening to diverse genres. I will note that the positioning of the buds makes all the difference when it comes to sound quality, so you'll need to make sure they're slotted in just right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DMx8Aq7QqENhTkXfxVSMCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each bud has a tiny 35mAh battery, with the case housing a 350mAh battery. It takes an hour to charge the buds within the case, and two hours to charge the battery on the case itself. Battery life is quite decent too, with the buds lasting over five hours on a single charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM" name="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro" alt="SoundPEATS PearlClip Pro earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nH8i8PmUzGRJFgN2zWSYBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case itself doesn't stand out, but it is easily pocketable, and at 47g, it doesn't weigh much. You get IPX5 water resistance, so you can use these buds while running or exercising, and they don't wiggle out of the ear even while running. The PearlClip Pro gets a lot right, and while the fit definitely takes some time to get used to, I'll admit that they're much more comfortable than I initially imagined.

<ul><li>Google teased Gemini 2.5 Flash at its Cloud Next 2025 conference, saying the model is "coming soon."</li><li>The company's Veo 2 video-generation model is becoming widely available as part of the Google AI Studio.</li><li>The Live API for Gemini is also becoming available in preview for real-time interactions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Cloud Next 2025 is officially here, and the first set of developer-focused announcements haven't disappointed. This week, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-flash-pro-live-api-veo-2-gemini-api/" target="_blank">announcing</a> that its Veo 2 video-generation model is production ready and widely available for use via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> API in Google AI Studio. Additionally, the company confirms that Gemini 2.5 Flash — a streamlined thinking model for basic tasks — is "coming soon."</p><p>As a video-generation model, Google says that Veo 2 is "able to follow both simple and complex instructions, as well as simulate real-world physics in a wide range of visual styles." Veo 2 will work with both text or image prompts, or both. This means you could describe to Veo 2 what you want your AI-generated video to turn into, provide the model with an image to work with, or a blend of the two options.</p><p>Users can try out<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-app-video-generation-veo-2-code-spotted"> Veo 2</a> in the Google AI Studio, and it can produce videos at 720p resolution at 24 frames per second. Currently, the big limitation is length. Videos created with Veo 2 can only be a maximum of eight seconds long. As an enterprise-grade tool, Veo 2 costs $0.35 per second of video generated.</p><p>As an example of what the model can do, Google shows off what Wolf Games is doing with Veo 2 in the video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uqLE4FMvKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The blog post also included a quick teaser that Gemini 2.5 Flash is on the way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 family of AI models</a> debuted last month and has been progressing at a rapid pace. It first became available as a Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model exclusive to subscribers, only to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">become available for free users days later</a>. Now, we have an idea of what Google is planning for the Flash variant.</p><p>"This evolution of our popular workhorse model will maintain low latency and cost-efficiency while incorporating thinking capabilities," the company said.</p><p>Finally, Google announced that the Live API for Gemini is now available in preview. This tool is designed to help with real-time interactions and "enables developers to build applications and agents that process streaming audio, video and text with low latency."</p><p>You can expect more announcements to come out of Google Cloud Next 2025, which is currently ongoing. Just yesterday, the company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-releases-enterprise-grade-gemini-tier-in-android-studio">a new Gemini version for Android Studio</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's A-series lineup of Pixel phones tends to be controversial. It's a mid-cycle release, which typically comes after the base-model Pixel is heavily discounted, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">leaving a ton of feature overlap</a>. This year's Google Pixel 9a is more of the same but with a twist. To find out whether the money spent on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">the midrange Pixel 9a is better than the flagship Pixel 9</a>, I tested both side-by-side for almost two weeks.</p><p>For the first time in recent memory, the Pixel 9a has a completely different design than the base Pixel 9 — kind of. The general oval-shaped camera cutout is still present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, but the iconic Pixel 9 camera bar is gone. With this change, the Pixel 9a's back is <em>almost </em>completely flat, but not all the way.</p><p>Starting with the good, it's nice that the Pixel 9a doesn't rock when it's on a flat surface. Despite being thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, it doesn't feel gargantuan in the hand. The device measures just 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, which is only 0.4mm thicker than the standard Pixel 9. That extra space adds 400mAh of battery capacity, which sounds like a worthy tradeoff.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also nice that the nearly-flush camera lenses will help the back become completely flat when paired with even the thinnest cases. I have found that the exposed glass covering, without a camera bar to protect it, makes the Pixel 9a camera housing more susceptible to scratching or collecting dust.</p><p>In terms of materials, the Pixel 9a's matte plastic back doesn't feel as satisfying as the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but that could be simply due to the lack of curves. The panel is completely flat, like the Pixel 9, embracing the rectangular design language of 2025 smartphones. Compared to the Pixel 9's glass back, neither phone feels inherently more premium than the other.</p><p>With that being said, the Pixel 9a looks bland and dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">without the instantly-recognizable Pixel camera bar</a>. I look at the Pixel 9 and know immediately that it's a Google smartphone, and just don't feel that same familiarity with the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The displays are both excellent-quality 6.3-inch p-OLED panels, with the Pixel 9a having bigger bezels than the standard Pixel 9. You can see the difference when the phones are next to each other, but I never noticed the bezels getting in the way during daily use. Both devices offer up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness, and the same resolution, so this isn't a reason to choose one over the other.</p>

<h2 id="performance-will-surprise-you-2">Performance will surprise you </h2>
<p>Things start to get tricky under the hood, with the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 sharing the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chip</a> but with different memory configurations. The higher-priced Pixel 9 gets 12GB of RAM, while the cheaper Pixel 9a only gets 8GB. This means that while the Pixel 9 can run the Gemini Nano XS model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">the Pixel 9a has the Gemini Nano XXS model instead</a>.</p><p>In practice, the Pixel 9a lacks certain AI staples on day one, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a>. Although the Pixel 9a gets the same seven-year OS upgrade and feature drop promise as the Pixel 9, it stands to reason that the former will get fewer features over time due to hardware limitations.</p>

<p>The really odd part of this is the Pixel 9a's benchmark scores. The Pixel 9a consistently beats the Pixel 9 in Geekbench 6 (trust me, I ran these multiple times to be sure). I can't figure out why, considering the Pixel 9 has the same chip and more available RAM, but can confirm that the Pixel 9a feels fast, smooth, and reliable during daily use. There wasn't any noticeable overheating either, despite testing in the Arizona desert.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-cameras-compare-2">How the cameras compare</h2>
<p>The positives continue as the Pixel 9a reverses a worrying trend of Google phones delivering photos with inaccurate colors. I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">full review of the Pixel 9a camera system</a>, but the short version is that the new 48MP main camera brings the midranger closer in line with flagship offerings.</p><p>It adds features like Macro Focus, all while improving computational photography and color science, as you can see in the samples below.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the Pixel 9's 50MP main sensor is significantly larger in sensor size than the Pixel 9a's camera. It also sports a 48MP ultrawide that will produce more detailed shots than the Pixel 9a's 13MP ultrawide lens. Both cameras will perform great in daylight, but the Pixel 9 is the clear winner in nighttime photography.</p>

<p>For most people, the Google Pixel 9 is objectively the better value than the cheaper Pixel 9a. When you look past the $799 retail price on paper, you'll realize that it's quite easy to find a Pixel 9 for only slightly more than the Pixel 9a. Both Amazon and Best Buy have the Pixel 9 discounted to $649 at the time of publishing, with the latter offering a $100 discount if you activate the phone at the time of purchase.</p><p>Yes, that means you could get a Pixel 9 — with more memory, a better camera, and a better screen — for just $50 more than a Pixel 9a. It's not hard to get it for even less if you're willing to take advantage of carrier contract deals (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">be careful of those</a>) or trade-in promotions.</p><p>Aside from the price, I feel much more confident that the Pixel 9 will get more features and updates over its software support window than the Pixel 9a due to the extra memory. Beyond that, the slimmer bezels, glass back, camera bar, and better display are just bonuses. That's why I think the Pixel 9 is the better buy for most people unless you're specifically looking for a basic Android phone with a long battery life.</p>

<p>Originally, I was ready to write off the Google Pixel 9a due to its debut limitations. With just 8GB of RAM, it isn't able to run the latest Pixel-exclusive AI tools on day one, let alone future tools that may be released years down the road. However, I soon realized that this might not only be acceptable to prospective Pixel 9a buyers — it could be preferable.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is decisively for the no-nonsense kind of Android phone user. It's made for the kind of person that will gladly take a conventionally-ugly smartphone with multi-day battery life. Or, the kind of person that thinks having fewer AI features shoved on their phone is a feature, not a bug. For those people, who just want a basic and good Android phone, there might not be something better than the Pixel 9a.</p>

According to several users on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oneui/">subreddit post,</a> Samsung has started rolling out the OS more widely today (April. 10) as promised in the company's rollout strategy announcement last month.</p><p>The first ones to see this software update pop up on their phones are those with either the Samsung S24 series phones or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, much like how the rollout happened in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Several users have been waiting with bated breath for this UI to drop since they saw some of its fun features pop up in beta versions of the OS. The build has rolled out on a larger scale but it seems to be rolling out to beta users first.</p><p>The highly anticipated  Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> update, seems to be around 5.2GB in size and comes with Samsung's April security patch. With this update, Samsung promises to take its AI experience to the next level. Giving users enhanced writing tools, image generation and more.</p><p>To check if your phone has received the One UI 7 update, head to <strong>Settings > Software Update > Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-the-one-ui-7-2">What to expect from the One UI 7</h2>
<p>For starters, AC's Harish Jonnalagadda is calling this, Samsung's best software update yet and for good reason. Right off the bat, once the OS is downloaded and ready to go, users can see the change with the Notification panel. Samsung has now split the controls with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. But this can be customized to a "unified-panel" with all the controls together.</p><p>The One UI 7 brings with it a vertically-scrolling app drawer, ditching the horizontal app drawer. Other than that, this update brings the belowed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>," the pill- shaped bar at the botoom of your lock screen that shows media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions.</p>

<p>Other features include Live Notifications that show up on the status bar, the camera interface also seems to have got a fresh coat of paint making it much more organized, among others. Here's a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review#section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"> full list </a>of what you can expect once you've successfully updated your phone to the latest One UI 7.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung is said to expand its software update to older eligible devices (Galaxy Z Fold 4/ Flip 4/ 3, S23 FE, A34, A35, S22/ S21 series, Tab S9/S8 series, A16) by May.</p><p>The update has rolled out to some of AC's  staff in the U.S. who own a Galaxy S24 series device. So if you aren't seeing an update pop up on your phones as yet, don't worry as the rollout seems to be happening in phases.</p>

<ul><li>Google's April security patch has started rolling out the entire Pixel lineup, including the latest Pixel 9a.</li><li>The patch solves a few camera issues for several Pixel series while also solving the brightness drop problem some users faced in March.</li><li>The security update arrives just as Google's Pixel 9a hits the market for all to purchase.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's expected monthly security patch is starting to make its rounds for its Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Today (Apr. 10), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/337176484/google-pixel-update-april-2025">posted the changelog</a> for the April 2025 security patch that involves its entire Pixel lineup. The company has shifted its version numbers slightly for users with different devices. According to the post, users with a Pixel 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a>, or Pixel Tablet will download v<strong>BP1A.250405.007</strong>. Users with a Pixel 7, 7a, Pixel 8, or 8a will see <strong>B1 </strong>attached to the end of the version. Additionally, the latest Pixel 9a will see BD4A.250405.<strong>003</strong>.</p><p>The patch notes this month are light but feature fixes for Google's Pixel camera. It states the update brings a fix for "camera stability" for users when zooming in or out in "certain conditions." This patch rolls in for the Pixel 6 and 7 series, as well as the original Fold.</p><p>Google is also rolling in another fix for the display for its entire Pixel lineup. The company says this fix should solve the pesky brightness flickering issue users suffered when using a streaming app.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issues with fingerprint recognition and response under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with overlapping views on lockscreen weather clock under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with Pixel Launcher when creating a new user or switching users under certain conditions</li></ul>

<p>One of the significant takeaways from Google's April update is the long-awaited fix for the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">brightness fluctuation issues</a> users reported in March. The issue seemingly spurred off the company's March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">feature drop</a>, which brought a hefty amount of new features for Pixels and the Pixel Watch. Many users with phones from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 reported their device's display brightness would "abruptly drop" when watching Netflix or Prime Video.</p><p>A temporary fix users found was to alter the device's fresh rate, but Google's official patch should remove the necessity for that.</p><p>Another issue that Google did not mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">concerns Pixel alarms</a>. Some users were waking up late in March as their Pixels — surprisingly — automatically disabled some alarms, leading to late starts for work. Aside from that, issues continued for Pixel users who reported <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">desynced weather forecasts</a>.</p><p>Users stated they were seeing outlooks that were days old, which isn't <em>exactly </em>what you'd want. Google jumped on this promptly, informing Android Central that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-weather-widget-desync-old-forecasts-reported">had started rolling out a fix</a> for affected users.</p><p>Also, you might want to check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">the all-new Pixel 9a</a>, which breaks the mold for performance and visuals that some flagships just can't match.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered signs in Android Auto's code that seemingly points toward smart glasses integration.</li><li>Strings of code mention a "Glasses" option and the ability for users to "start navigation" with their glasses.</li><li>This discovery surfaces a day after Google's TED 2025 demo, where it showcased its Android XR glasses "memory" capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent code discovery purports a truly interesting feature in development for Google's driving ecosystem.</p><p>Development for a curious new integration in Android Auto was spotted in an APK dive by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-smart-glasses-apk-3543456/">Android Authority</a>. Alongside the tipster, the publication discovered two new strings in Android Auto's recent version that both contain a "GLASSES" modifier. The first string is simply the option itself, which is for a "Glasses Option."</p><p>While nothing concrete surfaced, this code only adds an option for this new feature, likely within its settings/features list.</p><p>The second string is more interesting as Google's early added code reads, "Start navigation to launch Glasses." By the code's name, it seems Google is working on integrating Android Auto's console information with a user's connected pair of smart glasses for AR assistance. Speculation leans this way, too; however, how these alerts or bits of navigational information could appear is unknown.</p><p>This code was noticed in v14.2.151544 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, and since things are still barebones, we're likely still far from knowing more.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-future-of-android-xr-glasses-2">Google's Future of Android XR Glasses</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The timing of this discovery only pushes us in one direction: Google's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 demo</a> of its Android XR glasses. The highlight of the demo was the glasses' "memory" ability. The demoer, product manager Nishtha Bhatia, asked Gemini where she'd left her hotel room key. Since she was wearing her XR glasses — and Gemini was being attentive — the AI was able to respond with, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record."</p><p>Bhatia was able to relocate her key card on the shelf behind her, where the music record was.</p><p>Elswhere, Google stated, "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps." With that in mind, there's a chance Android Auto could bring similar possibilities to Google's XR glasses.</p><p>If we're keeping things lightweight, the "Glasses" option would simply retrieve the information from your car's onboard software instead of trying to load up maps in its frame. Google's TED 2025 demo also showed a pair of glasses that only feature a screen in one lens. The company previously showed off glasses with one display and another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">with two screens in 2023</a>, so it seems there are plans for multiple options.</p>

<p>Whenever someone gets their first VR headset, Job Simulator is almost always one of the first games they'll play. The game is as ubiquitous with virtual reality gaming as Beat Saber is and this has earned developer Owlchemy Labs quite the pedigree over the years. For that reason, the company's latest game, Dimensional Double Shift, immediately caught my eye.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/dimensional-double-shift/4449903565103159/">Dimensional Double Shift</a>, or DDS as I'll call it from now on, can be described essentially as a multiplayer Job Simulator. While Job Simulator sees you taking your time as one of four jobs, DDS splits the workload between two main job types to finish as many duties as you can within a shift. Each job supports up to four players, and you'll find that jobs change based on how many players are in the game and what workstations they're at.</p><p>While DDS is still a free-to-play game on the Meta Quest platform, the new Hexas dimension is the first paid DLC to debut. For $4.99, players will unlock Hexas and all the cheeky swag that comes along with it. Anyone can play in Hexas so long as at least one person in the party owns the pack, you just can't earn those sweet accessories unless you pay the $5. It's a great business model that mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> and ensures that everyone gets to have fun even if they don't have money to spare.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wMYf4hBkijW9P77LfJoHve" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-03" alt="Lighting up the grill in Dimensional Double Shift's cook job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMYf4hBkijW9P77LfJoHve.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hexas debuts the launch of public lobbies, as well as a completely new dimension to experience the cooking and mechanic jobs in. While the base jobs are the same concept, the ingredients, stations, and even mechanics of them can be wildly different.</p><p>Let's cover the basics first. DDS is a hand tracking-only game, meaning you'll toss those controllers aside and feel the sweet relief of your God-given hands in the air. The game's controls are weirdly tactile, given that you're <em>just grabbing air</em> the whole time, thanks to a unique system where items lock to your hand until you perform an obvious "letting go" gesture. That means you just dramatically open your hand very quickly to drop something.</p><p>Players start out in a lobby of sorts with two jobs to choose from: cooking or mechanic work. With Hexas, the dimension chosen is randomized, so you never know when you'll get to fix cars in Hell. You'll just have to play to see when it finally happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue" name="dimensional-double-shift-hexas-official-screenshot-06" alt="Filling up a demon head in Dimensional Double Shift's mechanic job on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmQVSRmyCSoGaR9RcYdgue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlchemy Labs)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've played Job Simulator, Vacation Simulator, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, or Cosmonious High, you'll immediately feel at home with the game's mechanics. As a cook, you'll grab an order ticket and assemble it as quickly as you can, and the fastest players will complete more orders than everyone else. The mechanic job is more about teamwork since the entire team works on a single car rather than individual vehicles.</p><p>Owlchemy Labs games are wildly creative and are best enjoyed by people who enjoy role playing and exploration. As the CEO of Owlchemy Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-wishlist-2024">once told me</a>, the best VR games "let you roleplay and don't put exposition in the way of your roleplaying."</p><p>That means when you start a job in Dimensional Double Shift, the workstation is your canvas. Each work station has completely different tools and machines with which to work. You don't move between stations during a shift, ensuring that teamwork is required when one person's problem requires a tool or part they don't have immediate access to.</p><p>Like all other Owlchemy Labs games, this is built for players with all sorts of heights and abilities, so you can adjust the height of your workstation on the fly, pass parts and ingredients between players, use hand gestures and your voice to communicate with other players, and so forth.</p>

<p>DDS's first dimension, Treeattle, is a parody play on the hipster hippy culture you might find in suburban and downtown Seattle. Hexas, likewise, is a parody of the larger-than-life attitudes and lifestyles you'll find in Texas, just with a demonic twist for comedic effect.</p><p>As with any good Owlchemy game, DDS rewards players for thinking outside of the box and combining items that otherwise might not go together. It also heavily leans into the alternate dimension concept where cars might have milkable udders or demonic patrons might enjoy a literal <em>bloody</em> Mary drink.</p><p>Everything is so ridiculous that it ups the fun factor even beyond what was in the original dimension, and the humor is just the right mix between older-kid-friendly and still hilarious to adults who understand the references.</p>

<p>As I've written about several times before, I love playing VR games with my family. Whether it's Dungeons of Eternity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">with my son</a> or Walkabout Mini Golf <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/at-home-date-nights-are-better-in-vr-no-seriously">with my wife</a>, there's  a real joy that comes with playing VR games with other people. For that reason, I absolutely had to play this one with them and the results couldn't have been better.</p><p>My son typically hates hand tracking games, but Owlchemy Labs has been perfecting hand tracking since Job Simulator and it shows. He didn't once complain about not being able to use controllers — something that's never happened with other hand tracking games — and was moving around with the precision normally only associated with using motion-tracked VR controllers.</p><p>My wife also enjoyed the heck out of the game, especially during the mechanic section when we had to co-op fix several different broken car parts. It was like putting both our hands on a physical puzzle and working together to solve it. The teamwork was amazing.</p>

<p>Owlchemy's CEO, Andrew Eiche, told me the company is already hard at work on the next big update. While he didn't commit to what sorts of new jobs we can look forward to, I'm confident that the next update will once again reinvent what DDS players have come to expect.</p><p>Now that lobbies can be publicly searched, it'll be significantly easier to find players online when you're friends (or family) aren't available to play. Given how great Owlchemy's previous games were when played in a room with other people, it shouldn't come as to any surprise that this game is a <strong>blast</strong> to play online.</p><p>Owlchemy's first online multiplayer game is a huge success — the game already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://owlchemylabs.com/blog/dimensional-double-shift-surpasses-500000-employees-players-becomes-owlchemy-labs-fastest-growing-title-ever">surpassed 500,000 downloads</a> and is the fastest-growing Owlchemy game ever — and Hexas doubles the fun for just $5. Hard to say no to that.</p>

<p>It's quite literally impossible to find a better phone for $107. The Google Pixel 9a not only packs the latest version of Android with nearly all the best Pixel features, but it also packs the same Tensor G4 processor as all the most expensive Pixel 9 phones. In short, that means Pixel flagship-level performance for a lot less money.</p><p>Be aware, though, that the Pixel 9a doesn't include <em>all</em> the same AI features that are in the more expensive Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">because it has less RAM</a>. That Gemini XXS model is still plenty capable, for sure, and will get you access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>This year, Google has outfitted the Pixel 9a with an upgraded ultrawide lens that includes a new macro focus mode so you can take gorgeous up-close shots this Spring. We put the camera to the test in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a camera review</a>, so you can get an idea of what to look forward to when your unit arrives.</p><p>Once you've secured the epic AT&T deal, take a look at the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">Pixel 9a screen protectors</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">Pixel 9a cases</a> to keep your investment protected. You won't lose much money if your phone breaks, thanks to this excellent deal, but it'll be hard to replace it at this same low price if that happens.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola posted an official teaser for its Razr 2025, which gave a slight look at its design and colors.</li><li>The company's 10-second teaser also hinted at its finishes, which seemingly includes a wood option.</li><li>Motorola confirmed its Razr 2025 will arrive on April 24.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next Motorola phone launch is shaping up to be a major one as the company teases its next "iconic" flip.</p><p>Motorola's U.S. X account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MotorolaUS/status/1910317856278855815">started teasing</a> the upcoming launch of the Razr 2025 earlier today (Apr. 10). We're coming up on the brand's typical release window for a foldable phone, and it seems we won't be disappointed. Motorola offered a short, 10-second clip of the next Razr, which features three foldables. This is curious, to say the least. Each device sports a different color, but there may be more behind Motorola showing a trio.</p><p>While the teaser doesn't give us the clearest look at the phones, it seems Motorola is sticking with dual cameras on the cover display. The cover screen is also expected to fully cover the front, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">like it has</a> over the past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">couple of generations</a>.</p><p>There's also a quick additional teaser, which glosses over the classic Motorola batwing logo. The clip shows off the red, blue, and (forest?) green colors; however, there's a wood finish, too.</p><p>Motorola delivers its latest teaser with the tagline, "When the ordinary flips to the extraordinary." The company is looking to "Make It Iconic" on April 24.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the ordinary flips to the extraordinary. #MakeItIconic 4/24 pic.twitter.com/tJ3Mk67uaL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1910317856278855815">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The end of last week held a major Motorola Razr 2025 leak, which seemingly left <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-motorola-razr-2025-series-leaks-again">nothing to the imagination</a>. The Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025 are expected to retain the design language the company has provided for the past few generations. That means a full 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display for the Plus model. The Plus is also rumored to receive Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</p><p>Rumors add the phone could sport an "action button" on its left side and come packed with loads of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai#section-moto-ai-features">Moto AI</a>.</p><p>The latest leaks claim the base Razr 2025 could see a slightly smaller 6.7-inch display and opt for the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip instead of Qualcomm.</p><p>There were rumors that the next Plus iteration could grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-charging-adapter-strength-database">68W wired fast charging</a>, but that remains to be seen as Motorola may not push the charger to this level on release. This charger could be paired with a larger 4,275mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-razr-plus-2025-leaked-specs">capacity battery</a> — or, perhaps even 4,500mAh — once it debuts.</p><p>The wood finish hinted at in Motorola's official teaser reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked">a leak from mid-March</a>. A few renders were discovered of the new phone in a wood finish, similar to what Motorola did with the Moto X. However, it's unclear if the company has opted for real wood or if it's fake, considering it seems a bit too glossy.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-is-the-google-pixel-9a-2">What is the Google Pixel 9a?</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a is the latest midrange smartphone by Google. Similar to previous installments of the A series, the Pixel 9a is all about packing flagship-quality specs into a device that costs under $500. Although the phone pushes right up against that line with a $499 price tag, it still offers a load of bang for the buck in the form of great hardware, AI-powered software features, and outstanding software support. </p><p>The phone is slated to feature a lovely 6.3-inch pOLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, while under the hood you&apos;ll find the same Tensor G4 chipset that powers the Google Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL. </p><p>As with other Pixel phones, the cameras are really where the 9a is going to shine. Straight out of the box, you&apos;ll get all of the latest Gemini AI software features with a 48MP main camera/13MP ultrawide, 8x Super Res Zoom, and Macro Focus with 4K video support. The phone also comes with IP68 water/dust resistance, seven years of OS/security updates, and a larger battery than its popular predecessor, the Google Pixel 8a. The phone also has a distinct rear design that may or may not work for you, and it&apos;s surprisingly lighter than the base model Pixel 9. </p><p>All in all, the Pixel 9a is clearly destined to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones of 2025</a>, and I can&apos;t wait to see what kind of deals the phone will receive as we enter the summer sale season. </p>
<h2 id="should-i-buy-the-google-pixel-9-or-pixel-9a-2">Should I buy the Google Pixel 9 or Pixel 9a?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, we put together a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9"> Google Pixel 9 vs Pixel 9a guide</a> to answer this very question! In short, it really depends on what you&apos;re willing to spend. Both devices boast great hardware, AI features, and years of software support, but you can expect the standard Pixel 9 to feature better performance, more RAM, and a nicer display. Is that enough to justify spending an additional $200 on your purchase? It&apos;s your call, but neither phone should disappoint. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google System updates usually enhance Android devices with new features, security improvements, and performance optimizations. These usually come via Play Store and Play Services, and the search giant has shared this month's release notes, giving us what to expect.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500#zippy=%2Cmarch">short changelog</a> of the release notes this week first up in the list is the system management update through Google Play services v25.13, which includes updates to system management services to improve battery life and device connectivity across Android devices, including Android Auto-enabled devices, PCs, phones, TV, and Wear OS devices.</p>

<p>Google Wallet for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is also getting a nifty new feature where users will now be able to add nicknames for their passes in the wallet.</p><p>Google Play Store has an "Ask Play" feature that gives answers about a specific app when asked within the app page. It usually gives AI-generated responses, and with the latest v45.7 version rollout this week, answers can be seen with videos when any question is raised via the aforementioned feature.</p>
<p>The other Android System Intelligence v.23 update includes the addition of logging for Adaptive Sound and code optimization for Smart Dictation. Also, every two weeks, "Google Maps (in cars with Google built-in) provides bug fixes and improvements that help you discover new places, navigate to them, and more."</p><p>Aside from these new inclusions, improvements to Play Protect can also be expected with the latest release. Google Play Protect is also expanding its protection to more "malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps, " the company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-is-using-ai-to-safeguard-play-store">announced</a> as an attempt to create a safer Android ecosystem.</p><p>Similarly, Google Play Store will also be adding verified badges starting with specific VPN apps to allow users to utilize safer VPN services, and the company intends to expand it to app categories shortly as well.</p>

<p>After a few weeks' delay, the Google Pixel 9a is finally here! We've loved the Pixel A-series for years, but this year gave us reason to worry. In addition to that "component quality issue" that caused the delay, there has been concern about performance issues, limited RAM, and the controversial new design language.</p><p>Thankfully, our reviewer, Michael Hicks, reports that Google's latest budget flagship was worth the wait. With the best battery life of any Pixel to date — yes, better than all the more expensive models — plus the same Tensor G4 processor as the more expensive Pixel 9 phones, it's hard to say no to the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we dive into some of the phone's features, let's talk pricing. The Pixel A-series has long prided itself on delivering extreme value at a mid-range price. That means renowned Pixel camera quality, one of the fastest processors for the price, and seven years of software updates that keep it feeling fresh for a long time.</p><p>You can grab the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a">unlocked from Google</a> for <strong>$499 / £499 / €549 / CA$679 / Rs 49,999</strong>, which nets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Roughly $100 more will double your storage, which could be helpful if you're planning on keeping it the full seven years. That's 2032, to put things in full perspective!</p><p>But if you don't want to buy it straight from Google for some reason, that's no big deal. You can also find the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0DVHV7X53/">unlocked at Amazon</a>, unlocked or with a carrier deal at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-iris/6612951.p?skuId=6612951">Best Buy</a>, or elsewhere in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/what-color-google-pixel-9a-should-you-buy">four excellent colors</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in the U.S. and are looking for a great Google Pixel 9a deal, all the major carriers (and even some smaller carriers) are running great launch-day sales. THE MOST RIDICULOUS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-9a.html">deal is from AT&T</a>, which is selling the Pixel 9a for just $2.99 a month with any unlimited plan. That's on a 36-month payment plan, but that only brings the TOTAL cost to $107. Keep in mind the Pixel 9a retails for $499, and you think you've gotten the deal of a lifetime, but AT&T isn't done.</p><p>Grab a Pixel 9a today from AT&T, and they'll also toss in a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A-Series</a> for free. That gets you a pair of legit fully wireless earbuds plus Google's best A-series phone yet for roughly $500 less than you'd pay if you bought them outright. It's impossible to find a better deal than this!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfkXdYApkKnbdyzWbzrd45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're not an AT&T customer or don't want to switch to AT&T for some reason, other carriers have good deals worth taking a look at, too. T-Mobile is also offering a free pair of Pixel Buds A-Series deal when you get a Pixel 9a through the Uncarrier. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/google-phone-deals">Pixel 9a is <em>free</em></a> when you add a new line with T-Mobile, which might be even more cost-effective than AT&T's deal, depending on your plan with the company.</p><p>US Mobile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usmobile.com/pixel-promo">is offering</a> a $799 bundle deal that includes a regular Pixel 9 PLUS a Pixel 9a. You'll need to opt for an Annual Starter or Premium plan through US Mobile to get the deal, but it's pretty slick being able to get two amazing Pixel 9 phones for this price.</p><p>Lastly, Verizon is offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-9a/">Pixel 9a for free</a> to all new customers. Existing customers won't get the deal, which is always sad, but Verizon does offer a rather excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/is-google-one-ai-premium-the-only-mobile-ai-suite-worth-paying-for">Google One AI Premium</a> add-on for $10 a month, which includes all the amazing features of Google's $20 plan — like full access to Gemini Live and tons of cloud storage — for half the price.</p>

<p>Alright, let's talk about that big design change first. There's no shortage of controversy around Google removing the camera bar on the Pixel 9A, but Google says the change was made to prioritize function over form. The phone is thicker than the Pixel 8A and looks a lot less unique, but it comes with several advantages because of the change.</p><p>Google broke the Pixel 9A down to its base components, added a huge vapor chamber to keep the Tensor G4 extra cool, then slapped a giant battery on top. That meant adding the camera bar would have made the phone unacceptably thick, by Google's standards, so the bar had to go. Thankfully, the left-aligned camera module didn't result in a wobbly phone despite the camera bar removal, which is a big sigh of relief.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-4" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris using the Pixel Camera app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yoq6V8p3eTw25tMuprxCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google swapped out the 64MP main camera from the Pixel 8a and replaced it with a 48MP camera on the Pixel 9a. While this sounds like a downgrade on paper, the 9a actually improves quality over the 8a in some scenarios. Brady Snyder conducted a full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a camera review</a> for us, which breaks down all of the differences.</p><p>Here's the TLDR version for now if you don't have to time to look at the longer article. The Pixel 9a noticeably improves color science over the Pixel 8a, delivering some of the most accurate colors from a Pixel camera in years. Daytime shots look incredible as a result, and you'll enjoy great AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a> any time of the day. Plus, the new Macro Mode turns out jaw-dropping macro shots.</p><p>In low light, there is a slight drop in sharpness and detail versus the Pixel 8a but, as Brady points out, you'd need to zoom in a lot to notice anything different. All in all, this is the Pixel camera you're looking for, and it's guaranteed to outperform anything in this price segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Q2jkao94WkARMdadeW5mTk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-design-close-up" alt="The Google Pixel 9a sitting atop a brick chimney." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q2jkao94WkARMdadeW5mTk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back on the design, there's sure to be a love/hate relationship with Google's changes. No, I don't mean the camera bar, mean the flattening of the overall phone. Gone are the smooth curves and ergonomic edges of the Pixel 8a's river rock design and, in their place, are very flat sides and a totally flat front and back. This makes the phone feel like a slate rather than the "friendly" design of last year's model.</p><p>But, as Google previously noted, most people won't notice the design change because it's going to be in a case. There are already some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">amazing Google Pixel 9a cases</a> to grab, so if that's your plan, the wider, flatter Pixel 9a will feel just fine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-8" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pixel 9a doesn't fall into the "small" phone category with its 6.3-inch display — it matches the Pixel 9 and is larger than the 8a — Michael noted that it was easier to hold than most budget phones in its class. Some of that is thanks to weight, but a lot of it is down to the design.</p><p>Aside from making it flatter, Google also improved the Pixel 9A's water and dust resistance rating over the 8a, giving it the IP68 rating of its full-priced flagship models. Unfortunately, this one uses older Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back, so we don't recommend going caseless unless you're ultra careful with your phones.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">good Pixel 9a screen protector</a> will keep it protected for a long time to come. Plus, unlike some other screen protectors, these won't interfere with that ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the display.</p>

<p>When Apple launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> last month, many were left scratching their heads. Not only was the phone too expensive for what it offered, but Apple only shipped it with a single camera on the back. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9a-vs-iphone-16e-value-3542727/">Android Authority</a> points out this morning, Apple's phone looks even worse now that the Pixel 9a is out.</p><p>While both the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16e feature a similar 48MP main camera, Google's photo processing has outpaced Apple's for some time. The Pixel is better at capturing subjects in motion than an iPhone — I've named Pixel phones the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best phones for parents</a> for years because of this — and the more color-accurate Pixel 9a camera also helps make photos look more like real life.</p><p>And while the main camera is definitely an upgrade over the iPhone 16e, the Pixel 9a's secondary rear camera is the real star of the show here. Not only is it a super high-quality ultrawide camera but it also doubles as a macro camera that delivers some of the best macro shots you'll find on any phone. That's not something your ordinary $500 phone can claim, and definitely <em>not</em> something the $600 iPhone 16e can do at all.</p>

<p>If you need any one reason to choose a Pixel 9a over other Pixel phones, it's the battery life. Google Tensor processors have never been very efficient and that has resulted in poor battery life, but big thermal changes and an even bigger battery make the Pixel 9a <strong>the</strong> Pixel phone to get for battery life.</p><p>Android Central's Michael Hicks and Brady Snyder both said they were able to get around 2 days of use out of a single charge, something that's absolutely <em>never</em> been true of any Pixel phone to date. Most Pixel A-series phones struggled to last just one day, much less into the second at all.</p><p>That's all while packing the exact same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> processor as all the more expensive Pixel 9 series phones. Yes, that even includes the $1700 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<p>If you need any proof that "different strokes for different folks" is the truth, look no further than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/10/google-pixel-9a-review/">9to5Google's review</a> of the Pixel 9a. Abner Li says, "Google has created my new favorite phone design," citing the almost-flat, camera-bar-less design as the reason.</p><p>This design change, coupled with the matte glass back and the flat side rails, makes it much nicer to hold than the mainline Pixel 9 series, according to Abner. "The Pixel 9a feels like you’re just holding a screen" might just be my favorite quote from the review, as it's easily the most positive thing I've heard from anyone regarding the Pixel 9a's incredibly flat and sterile design.</p><p>What might be more interesting is Abner's love for the uniformity of the design. "It results in such a clean form however you’re handling, like when fishing out of your pocket or bag, or gripping." Despite that uniformity, the matte glass on the back feels different enough from the shiny glass on the front that "you won’t mistake the two materials." Plus, matte glass isn't a fingerprint magnet like the shiny glass on other Pixel 9's.</p><p>I far prefer the rounder design of the Pixel 8a and love the camera bar on older Pixel phones, but it's clear that some people simply like different things. Will that be you? Let us know!</p>

<p>Great performance isn't common in a $500 phone these days, but Google has bucked that trend since the Google Pixel 6a with its Tensor G1 processor. Now that we're on Tensor G4, Google has worked out the thermal issues and ensured that this is still class-leading performance in most cases. At the least, the Tensor G4 is a much better fit for the $500 Pixel 9a than it is in the $999 Pixel 9 Pro, as Michael Hicks pointed out in our review.</p><p>But don't just take our word for it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html">Engadget's review</a> echoes the same sentiments, citing multicore performance on par with the more expensive Pixel 9 series. The only lament made is the reduced amount of RAM, which means power users will likely be less happy with the Pixel 9a than the mainline series, which features 4GB of RAM more than the 9a.</p><p>There's also a possibility that some AI features in the future might not make it to the Pixel 9a, as we've seen older phones skip newer AI features due to lack of RAM. Ironically, Google's lowest-spec phone features as much RAM as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">most expensive iPhone</a> so, at the very least, we don't expect to see the Pixel 9a fall behind iPhones in terms of great software features.</p>

<p>Another great reason to choose the Pixel 9a is longevity. The Pixel 9a gets seven years of OS updates and security patches, "leaving behind most mid-range phones with two or three OS versions at most" as Michael puts it in our review.</p><p>Most of the time, lower-cost phones aren't worth holding on to for a long time because they ship with lower-performance processors that simply don't do well after a few years. The processor in the Pixel 9a is not only fast enough to last for several years, but Google guarantees updates through 2032. That's simply not the norm on other phones.</p>

<p>Howdy all, I'm the guy who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">reviewed the Pixel 9a</a> (Michael Hicks) and I'm taking over this live blog for the next few hours! Do you have questions for Brady and I about the 9a? You can email michael.hicks@futurenet.com with your questions or concerns and assuming the spam filter doesn't eat them, I'm happy to answer them here.</p><p>For starters, let's talk software. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9a-missing-android-15-feature-drop-at-launch/">Android Police</a> covered the fact that the Pixel 9a is missing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel Drop features</a> like Modes, and that you'll probably have to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> for a major 9a update.</p><p>On the one hand, I'll point out that the Pixel 9 series launched with Android <em>14</em>, so a missing feature drop doesn't feel that bad to me. On the other hand, the Pixel 9a is <em>never</em> going to get some Gemini Nano features like Pixel Screenshots because of its 8GB of RAM. So if you're someone who closely follows every Pixel Drop and tests every new AI feature, the Pixel 9a might not be the right fit for you!</p>

<p>Looking over other sites' Pixel 9a reviews, the harshest comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Techradar</a>, which gave it a 3/5, said it's "so dang ugly" compared to other Pixels, and claimed that despite the larger battery, it doesn't actually last longer than the Pixel 9 or 9 Pro.</p><p>I guess to decide that the 9a battery was no big deal, they did a rundown test and found that both the 9a and 9 both lasted about 13 hours while streaming content. But that's not really indicative of real-world use, and in that case, I found that it really does last about a day and a half with active use, while past Pixels were much more likely to require a daily top-off. Other reviews I've read agree that the battery boost is real.</p><p>As for the phone being "ugly as sin," I mean, <strong>every</strong> phone these days is a "flat slab of plastic broken by a round camera bump." I certainly agreed in my review that this design is pretty boring, and that I miss my Pixel 9's camera bar. But out of the reasons not to buy a Pixel 9a, I'd argue that ugliness isn't really one of them. It just looks like any other Android phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wEWwJ6NYwrrgQcJTyvhFLk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Pixel-Studio" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in hand, showing the Pixel Studio app creating a logo from a text prompt." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEWwJ6NYwrrgQcJTyvhFLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's talk more about AI. As I said in my review, if your experience with AI is using Gemini Live, Pixel Studio, or any other app that relies on <em>cloud</em>-based processing, then using the Pixel 9a is no different from a Pixel 9 or 9 Pro. I ran queries on multiple Pixels at once, and the 9a took the same amount of time.</p><p>The bigger issue is that the Pixel 9a uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">"Gemini Nano XXS"</a> because of its 8GB of RAM, limiting features like Pixel Screenshots that require on-device AI. Even though it has the same Tensor G4 and powerful NPU as its siblings, the Pixel 9a just isn't able to think for itself — or maybe just not well enough for Google to unlock the feature for consumers.</p><p>In the long run, a Pixel 9 Pro with 16GB of RAM will probably be able to handle future on-device AI tricks years down the line, but a Pixel 9a, 10a, and so on may be permanently shut out. For AI fans, that may be a bigger deal than missing out on a telephoto lens or other Pro perks.</p>

<p>Is the Google Pixel 9a the best mid-range phone of the year? If you let your budget creep up to $599, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is a tough challenger because of its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, 12GB/256GB memory, LTPO display, <em>much</em>-faster charging at 80W, and 50MP telephoto lens with 2X optical zoom.</p><p>I'd personally choose the Pixel 9a, simply because it's about an ounce lighter and I'd prioritize compact comfort and a lower price. It also gets three more years of OS updates, though I don't know how many people use A-series phones for more than four years anyway.</p><p>Otherwise, most of the other phones in this price range like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing 3a Pro</a>, or Motorola Edge can't match the Pixel 9a for specs or AI insights.</p>

<p>AC's parent company has a testing suite (Future Labs) that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Tom's Guide</a> used for more concrete Pixel 9a display quality testing than my typical eyeball tests in its review.</p><p>They found that the Pixel 9a hit 2,076 peak brightness, about double what the iPhone 16e offers and nearly double the OnePlus 13R and Nothing 3a Pro. Most importantly, it easily beat the Pixel 8a (1,378 nits), though it lost to the Pixel 9 (2,390).</p><p>The 9a also hit an impressive 94.2% DCI-P3, though Tom's Guide found it "doesn’t quite reach the same "iridescence" or color accuracy as the Pixel 9.</p><p>In my testing, I couldn't really tell the Pixel 9 and 9a displays apart that clearly, but I <em>could</em> tell that the 9a display was exceptionally bright for a phone in this price range, and this objectively proves it. If you're like me, and like to take your phone on runs in sunny weather, the 9a is a great fit.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a camera may be downgraded compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, but when I looked at my 9a camera samples (I threw a few of them above), the colors are genuinely accurate to real life, without the overprocessing I expected.</p><p>People will be excited that the Pixel 9a added Add Me for AI trickery, but I'm a bigger fan of Macro Focus. Get a couple of inches away from a subject, and the viewfinder will show a little green flower symbol and automatically switch to this mode, determining the subject and putting that in focus while the rest blurs out. It's a nice upgrade for Pixel 8a users who upgrade.</p><p>The Pixel 9a has its downsides — the lack of optical zoom and struggles with low light, and a general lack of detail compared to more expensive phones — but this is still a Pixel phone, which means you can expect a certain level of quality.</p>

<p>A couple of Pixel 9a reviews and posts — including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-9a-review-a-value-packed-phone-just-at-the-right-time/">CNET</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-9a/">Wired</a>, and The Verge — have referenced the recent threats of tariffs, saying that the $499 Pixel 9a is coming at "the right time" and hoping that price doesn't change. Google told CNET that "there are no changes to the pricing and availability of the Pixel 9A" related to tariffs, at least for now.</p><p>Without diving into the complicated politics and worsening trade fight between the U.S. and China, it's fair to say that the Pixel 9a should remain at $499 in the short term, but that most tech brands will pass off tariff costs to the consumer if things <em>do</em> escalate.</p><p>So aside from the fact that carriers and the Google Store are offering good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Pixel 9a pre-order deals</a>, you may want to buy a 9a now, simply to lock in that affordable price.</p>

<p>Ready to chuckle at Google? Here's the "replacement Pixel 9a" that Google just sent to Brady.</p><p>Some background: He's been testing the Pixel 9a as well, and he's had issues with the under-display fingerprint sensor refusing to acknowledge his biometrics, even after rescanning them. Google said it must be a defective unit and promised to send him a new Pixel 9a. Instead, he got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, which was definitely a shipping error but <em>feels</em> like Google is trying to subtly tell us something 😂.</p><p>In all seriousness, I haven't had any issues with the fingerprint sensor, and glancing over a dozen other Pixel 9a reviews, no one else has mentioned it. So it's entirely possible that it <em>is</em> a rare hardware error rather than anything to worry about. But if you end up having problems, send it back to Google and you might get an accidental $600 upgrade.</p>

<p>Let's talk <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/what-color-google-pixel-9a-should-you-buy">Pixel 9a colors</a>. Google sent me the Porcelain Pixel 9a, and hoo boy is it the worst of the four. Obsidian (black) is inoffensive and makes the camera sensor blend in more seamlessly, while this off-white Porcelain model only makes the 9a's slab look more apparent.</p><p>Google sent Brady the Iris model, which I think must indicate that they like him better than me. If I were to buy a 9a, I'd choose Iris because the soft blue gives it a bit of personality without being quite as gaudy as Peony — which is kind of fun but trends a bit too close to cotton candy coloring for my personal tastes.</p>

<p>One of the big questions with the Pixel 9a was with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">last-gen Exynos modem</a>, which is slightly older than the 5400 found in the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The challenge with "reviewing" a modem is that it's highly situational. My Bay Area coverage is fairly comprehensive so that the Pixel 9a rarely struggled with cellular connectivity or excess battery drain throughout my testing period; nor did Brady experience any issues yet. But if you've had problems with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, it's fair to assume that the 9a will have similar issues.</p><p>You also get Wi-Fi 6E support; I find that more than sufficient but people with Wi-Fi 7 routers will disagree.</p>

<p>Hey all, it's Brady Snyder taking over, and I've spent the better part of two weeks testing my Google Pixel 9a review unit in comparison to its biggest competitors — including the Pixel 9, Pixel 8a, Pixel 7a, and Nothing Phone 3a Pro. To start, I want to talk about how the Pixel 9a shakes up against the Pixel 9, which only costs slightly more after deals and promotions.</p><p>You're going to hear a lot about how the Pixel 9a has 8GB of RAM, which is four gigabytes fewer than the Google Pixel 9. That means it should perform worse than the Pixel 9, right? Wrong. I was stunned that the Pixel 9a consistently performs better than the Pixel 9 in synthetic benchmark tests, like Geekbench 6.</p>

<p>That means if you don't care about new AI features — like Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes, which are missing — the Pixel 9a is a more than capable daily driver.</p><p>You can check out my full breakdown of how these two phones compare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google did something great with this year's Pixel 9a — it is offering storage upgrades in more colors for the first time. On paper, you'll see that the Google Pixel starts at $499 for 128GB of storage, and can be upgraded to 256GB of storage for an extra $100. They're the same storage configurations as last year.</p><p>What's different? This year, you aren't stuck buying the Obsidian (Black) colorway if you want extra storage space. With both the Pixel 7a and Pixel 8a, the 256GB storage option was only available for the Obsidian color, limiting your options. Now, you can get the Pixel 9a in 256GB in either the Iris or Obsidian colorways.</p><p>The Porcelain and Peony colors are still only available as 128GB models, but this slight expansion is a good start for Google's A-series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VPAaa9HeDidGkJhtGSoLtf" name="Pixel-9a-Gemini-Live" alt="The Gemini Live video streaming on the Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VPAaa9HeDidGkJhtGSoLtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a's memory limitations mean that it can only run Gemini Nano XXS, a smaller and less powerful AI model than the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The good news is that these shortcomings won't affect the Pixel 9a's off-device AI capabilities, like with Gemini Live. The Pixel 9a gets the same Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing experience as all the other Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series phones, which is impressive at the $499 price point.</p>

<p>More importantly, Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing is completely free on the Pixel 9a. Phones from other brands, including older Pixel and Galaxy models, won't get the features free-of-charge. They'll need to pay $20 per month for the Google One AI Premium plan. The Pixel 9a's inclusion of all the latest Gemini Live features is yet another reason why it pays to opt for Google's midranger over the competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yryPdtTP8jE4d6K7ZBuygX" name="Pixel9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-3" alt="The Pixel 9a in Iris beside the Pixel 8a in Aloe and Pixel 7a in Bay." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yryPdtTP8jE4d6K7ZBuygX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plenty of testers, including those at Android Central, have praised the Pixel 9a's new pOLED screen on the Google Pixel 9a, and for good reason. It's the brightest A-series phone ever, topping out at 2,700 nits of peak brightness. If that wasn't enough, it also happens to sport the exact same resolution as the regular Pixel 9. The bezels are bigger on the Pixel 9a, but that fades away pretty quickly when you start using the device.</p><p>However, the bigger deal might be that the Pixel 9a now has a 6.3-inch screen for the first time. The Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a both had 6.1-inch displays, which made them a smaller and more compact offering. Now, the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 have the same exact screen size, further reducing the differences between models. Do you think Google should've stuck with a more compact form factor for the A-series?</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a's controversial design has been well-chronicled, and I can't decide whether I love it or hate it. One thing's for sure — if Google wanted to go for a flat back, it should've made the Pixel 9a <em>completely</em> flat. Instead, the company split the middle, creating a phone that's nearly flat with a slight protrusion for the cameras coming out of the polycarbonate plastic back.</p><p>This causes a few real-world issues. I've noticed that the tiny crack between the glass camera covering and the plastic trim quickly becomes a dust magnet, capturing all the lint in your pocket. Additionally, the Pixel 9a's rear camera covering seems more prone to getting covered in dust or scratches due to the design. For reference, while the Pixel 9's camera bar protrudes from the phone's back glass, the camera glass is actually slightly recessed in that aluminum bar.</p><p>It's something to consider before buying a Pixel 9a, but I don't think it should be a dealbreaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP" name="Pixel-9a-Overheating" alt="The Google Pixel 9a overheating." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overheating has been an all-too-common problem on past Google Pixel phones, but what about on the new Pixel 9a? Like the other Tensor G4-powered phones, the Pixel 9a usually operates fine even in tough conditions. However, that's not to say it won't ever overheat. I happen to live in Phoenix, Arizona, which is an absolutely grueling climate for anything with a battery.</p><p>Today, it's 97-degrees Fahrenheit, and I made the mistake of leaving my Pixel 9a in direct sunlight for about 10 to 15 minutes. The screen was off, but the phone ended up shutting down completely and restarting after that span. To be fair, my M2 MacBook Air crashed less than a minute afterward, so this isn't a Pixel 9a problem. It is something to keep in mind if you live in an unusually-hot climate, though.</p>

<p>After thoroughly testing the Google Pixel 9a, the impressive new feature that stands out to me is Macro Focus. To be clear, the feature isn't new, appearing on the rest of the Pixel 9 series and even Pixel phones older than that. However, the Pixel 9a represents the first time an A-series phone gets to use Macro Focus.</p><p>Google now uses the main, 48MP camera for Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a. Previously, the Pixel 8a used the 13MP ultrawide lens to create pseudo-macro shots that didn't turn out that amazing. Meanwhile, the experience with Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a couldn't be more different. It's not a gimmick — it really provides a stunning level of detail, down to the hairs on a tomato plant.</p>

<p>Hours deep into Google Pixel 9a launch day, there still are plenty of ways to get your hands on a new phone quickly. In fact, the Pixel 9a is available for in-store pickup at select Google Store locations today, including at Google's NYC Williamsburg and Chelsea stores. Depending on your location, you could be looking at delivery dates for all Pixel 9a colors around April 16 or April 17 — about a week away.</p><p>Google Store is also offering a limited-time promotion that'll net you $100 store credit toward your next purchase when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9a" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">buy an unlocked Pixel 9a</a>.</p>

A "component quality issue" delayed its launch by weeks, and early reports about an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-past-gen-exynos-modem-confirmation">outdated Exynos modem</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">limited Gemini Nano tools</a> had us concerned it would fall short of the A-series' usual quality.</p><p>That's why I focused my Pixel 9a review period on stress-testing its apparent weak points. I tested the modem's performance and drain in remote areas, put Gemini through its paces, and checked for any Tensor performance issues with overheating.</p><p>My ultimate perspective? The Pixel 9a has kept up the A-series legacy as a solid value flagship. I did notice compromises in terms of camera quality and long-term AI viability, but they're reasonable cutbacks that only power users won't accept.</p><p>And the revamped Pixel 9a battery life is good enough to even make Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro owners jealous.</p>

<p>After a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-does-the-right-thing-by-delaying-pixel-9a-pre-orders">delayed launch</a>, the Google Pixel 9a hits shelves on April 10 in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, followed by 27 other countries on April 14–16. You will find the Pixel 9a at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a?hl=en-US">Google Store</a>, carrier sites, and retailers like Best Buy.</p><p>The 8 GB/128 GB variant costs $499 / £499 / €549 / CA$679 / Rs 49,999; we don't have an official price for the 8GB/256GB model yet, though T-Mobile prices it at $599.</p><p>As with most Pixel A-series phones, the Google Pixel 9a has the same processor, display, and storage as the mainline Pixel 9 but with other cost-cutting differences. If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9 differences</a> are too stark, you may want to consider an upgrade.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a has the same machine-cut, flat-sided aesthetic as most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iPhones these days. Its only claim to fame is the ultra-slim, teardrop camera sensor that's a bit <em>too</em> subtle, squeezed into the corner of a flat, matte slab.</p><p>The classic Pixel camera housing catches on pockets but keeps your phone steady on flat surfaces. I was worried the left-aligned 9a sensor would bring back the imbalanced wobble so common with other brands, but it doesn't! It's easy to browse and tap the 9a on a desk or wireless charger, and it's much simpler to slide it into my jeans pocket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-camera-bar" alt="Close-up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEQmVWxQzVzvRRiGuWPDaA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google justified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">removing its trademark camera bar</a> by explaining it was necessary to "eliminate battery anxiety" with more capacity and make the 9a vapor chamber larger for better thermals.</p><p>This naturally made the 9a thicker, so they had to slim down the display and camera sensors to keep it at the same 8.9mm thickness as the Pixel 8a. Frankly, that's <em>not</em> very slim, and the 8a has softer edges to ease the grip a bit.</p>

<p>Removing the camera bar was the right decision: Battery life is the trademark feature the 9a needed, the cooling chamber seems to be effective, and it offsets the extra weight. The trade-off is that the thicker 9a widens your grip a bit, which takes a little getting used to.</p><p>Still, it's lighter and easier to hold than most 6.7-inch budget phones; the 9a isn't a "small phone," but it falls into a decent sweet spot.</p><p>I also appreciate that the Pixel 9a has IP68 dust and water resistance, a slight bump in the usual IP67 standard. Unfortunately, Google stuck with Gorilla Glass 3 for protection, saving Victus 2 for the mainline Pixel 9s. I don't have any scratches yet, but it's only a matter of time without a screen protector.</p><p>Caseless daredevils will enjoy the Pixel 9a's matte finish that doesn't show fingerprints (at least on my Porcelain model). I also appreciated that the volume rocker and power button have a more subtle <em>click</em> than the Pixel 8a when pressed.</p>

<p>Google essentially transplanted the Pixel 9 display onto the Pixel 9a. You get the same 6.3-inch size, FHD resolution, non-LTPO 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits of brightness outdoors or 1,800 nits with HDR.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, no phone hits its peak brightness score outside of cherry-picked pixels and settings trickery. However, that 1,800 high-brightness mode (HBM) score is legitimate: the 9a is comfortably readable with decent color saturation in direct California sunlight, while the Pixel 8a (1,400 nits) is dimmer and less pleasant to use outdoors.</p><p>Compare the Pixel 9a against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> (1,600 nits HBM) or Galaxy A56 (1,200), and it's clear that it's the mid-range phone to beat for outdoor use.</p>

<p>Despite the 9a's tradeoffs in other areas, it's visually uncompromised from the Pixel 9 — except for its lesser Gorilla Glass protection, slightly thicker bezels, and 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. I watched vivid YouTube nature videos side-by-side on the Pixel 9 and 9a, and I couldn't see any clear difference in color accuracy or contrast.</p><p>Unless you're used to QHD+ resolution or have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, you should be perfectly satisfied with the 9a display experience.

<p>The classic A-series appeal is getting a "flagship" chip in a mid-range phone. Tensor chips have fallen behind the top Snapdragon and Dimensity chips for raw power — though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC-made G5 may change that</a> — but the Tensor G4 feels like a much better fit for a $499 phone than a $999 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>Past A-series phones showed subtle Tensor downgrades or thermal issues in post-launch teardowns, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The redesign to squeeze in proper vapor cooling paid off in the benchmarks: the Pixel 9a is the slowest of the three phones, but not by a significant margin, and its graphical performance is right in the mix despite having 4–8GB less RAM.</p><p>This year's Snapdragon flagships may crush the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, but when it comes to mid-range phones, the Tensor G4 easily destroys the competition for browsing, gaming, and AI.</p><p>My colleagues resented that the Pixel 9 & 9 Pro default to 128GB UFS 3.1 storage, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> option for faster data transfer and game loading. That's a fair complaint for flagships, but this storage level is a reasonable default for mid-tier phones.</p><p>Otherwise, the hardware perks I've liked on other Pixels apply here, particularly the subtle but strong haptics and fairly rich stereo sound whenever I'm not using wireless earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNnzDF9vqkG5X65LDkvq23" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-6" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in the hand showing the Android Central homepage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNnzDF9vqkG5X65LDkvq23.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of specific 9a downgrades, the 8GB of memory has little noticeable impact on day-to-day browsing or Android gaming, aside from some occasional lag while editing photos. However, it <em>does</em> restrict a few Gemini Nano-powered features that require <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>, which I'll address in the software section.</p><p>You also get Wi-Fi 6e, though the 9a adds more antennas with 2x2 MIMO. Whether I used wireless or cellular over the Exynos modem, I didn't notice any connectivity issues, dropped calls, or slow downloads over Google Fi. Your mileage may vary based on your network and region; if you're at all concerned, snag a Pixel 9 for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and a newer modem.</p><p>As a final point, my colleague Brady Snyder has had issues with the 9a under-display fingerprint sensor, even after rescanning his prints. I haven't had a single failed reading all week, but I've included his grievance since it's a familiar refrain for the last few generations of Pixel fingerprint sensors.</p>

<p>Battery life is the star of the Pixel 9a show. Google estimates 30+ hours, a 6-hour boost over the 8a. We called last year's A-series "disappointing" for battery life, while the Pixel 9a <em>easily</em> lasts a day with heavy gaming, streaming, camera, and AI use, with juice to spare.</p><p>Both Brady and I found that we could stretch the 9a to two days with more casual use and decent standby battery life. Your mileage will vary if you toggle the Smooth Display option, but unlike with the 8a, it won't wreck your battery life if you <em>do</em> turn it on.</p><p>Many other budget phones have 5,000mAh+ capacity but much larger displays and less efficient chipsets than the Tensor G4. I wonder if people who buy phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review" target="_blank">Moto G Power 2025</a> will like the 9a's compact endurance or if they'll find it too expensive.</p><p>The Pixel 9a's longevity mitigates its problem with slow 23W charging. Because it'll easily last a full day and night with capacity to spare, it might not matter that it takes about 20 minutes to hit 25%, 46 minutes to 50%, or 105 minutes to hit 100% with a 30W charger. Pixel 9 charging is barely any faster, so you're not missing out on anything.</p><p>I rarely use wireless charging, but let's be frank: at 7.5W, it's only suited for overnight charging where speed doesn't matter. Otherwise, it's so slow as to be almost pointless.</p>

<p>His results mirrored my own. I found that the Pixel 9a captures vivid colors where other phones (like the 8a) tend to oversaturate, but that you need bright conditions and to get close to your subject to capture enough detail.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed the Macro Focus shots, as shown above. It usually does a good job of recognizing what should remain in focus or be blurred out, and the viewfinder will automatically switch to this mode when you get close enough to your subject, making it easy to use.</p><p>Generally speaking, the Pixel 9a outperforms almost any mid-range phone for camera quality, even if you can see its obvious shortcomings compared to a Pixel 9 Pro with better optical zoom, a larger sensor that captures more light, and more pro settings.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a claims the top spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> list. One cheaper alternative is the Samsung Galaxy A56, which has a dimmer 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED with better Victus+ protection. It gets six years of OS updates, and its 5,000mAh battery is paired with faster 45W charging. But its Exynos 1580 chip isn't as powerful as the Tensor G4.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R costs $100 more for a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip with more raw power paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB UFS 4.0 storage, plus a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED, 6,000mAh battery with 80W charging, and a 50MP telephoto lens. This is a true value flagship, but again, it's a bit expensive, quite heavy, and only gets four years of OS updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> is another alternative. At $459, you get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, dual 50MP sensors with a 3X periscope lens for good camera quality, a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display, and six years of support. But you also get a slower Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, Wi-Fi 6, a heavy design with a bulky camera island, and IP64 water resistance.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Google Pixel 9a if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best possible battery life paired with Pixel smarts.</li><li>You see Gemini AI as an exciting novelty (but maybe not a daily necessity).</li><li>Google's trademark software support and camera processing appeal to you.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Google Pixel 9a if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You care about Wi-Fi 7, Gemini Nano, or telephoto lenses.</li><li>You want a larger display or blazing charging speeds (especially wireless).</li><li>You want the best possible benchmarks or pro camera tools.</li></ul>
<p>I don't know what Google fixed with its component quality delay, but it seems to have worked.</p><p>I'll continue to test the Google Pixel 9a over the next couple of months to see if I missed any obvious pain points, but so far, I haven't had any issues, and Brady's only complaint with his 9a loaner is with the fingerprint sensor and low-light photography.</p><p>It's easy to take the A-Series for granted, but it's pretty darn rare to get a $499 phone with a "flagship" chip and excellent AI-backed photography. Now that we get epic battery life too, the Pixel 9a is tough competition for any mid-range phone. I still kinda miss the camera bar, but I can live with that.</p>

Google ditched the 64MP primary sensor on the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a for a 48MP wide camera on the Pixel 9a. By now, you might be wondering why Google went with a smaller primary camera sensor with fewer megapixels and how it performs compared to previous-generation Pixels.</p><p>As it turns out, Google switched to a different main camera in part to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">the Pixel 9's almost-flush camera system</a> possible. "Pixel 9a has an all-new rear main camera that enables the new industrial design and new Macro Focus," the company told Android Central.</p><p>After two weeks of testing the Pixel 9a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and Pixel 7a side-by-side, I can confidently say that the latest camera hardware isn't a noticeable downgrade from the older models. You might notice a slight dip in detail in certain situations, specifically in unfavorable lighting conditions. But you'd need to zoom in to notice, and it's a minuscule drop compared to all the other Pixel 9a camera improvements.</p><p>Notably, the Google Pixel 9a appears to reverse a recent trend with Pixel cameras that oversaturated colors at the expense of accuracy. The Pixel 9a is the most color-accurate Google phone I've tested in at least a few generations, and that should be the main takeaway here. Let's dive in and explore how the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> fare in head-to-head rear camera tests.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-main-camera"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Main camera</span></h2>
<p>First, let's start out with some specs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is equipped with a 48MP, f/1.7 primary camera with a 1/2-inch image sensor size. By comparison, both the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a have a 64MP, f/1.89 primary camera with a 1/1.73-inch image sensor size. The change in megapixel count shouldn't concern you at all (the Pixel 9 has a 50MP camera, for reference), but the smaller image sensor size on the Pixel 9a was initially concerning.</p><p>Image sensor size directly correlates to image quality because bigger sensors can take in more light and color information, leading to more detailed shots. However, it isn't the only thing that leads to great smartphone photos — other things like computational photography, color science, and image processing also play a huge role.</p><p>In the image gallery of camera sample comparisons below, you'll see that there isn't a noticeable drop-off in detail between the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a in daylight.</p>

<p>In terms of detail and quality, the Pixel 9a matches or beats the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a in every test. What really caught my eye was the differences in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr">HDR and color science</a> in photos captured with the Pixel 9a. Whether it's related to the camera sensor itself, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">upgraded Tensor G4 chip</a>, or software, it leads to photos that more accurately represent the landscape you're trying to capture.</p><p>I live in the Arizona desert, an environment that Google Pixel cameras of all price points have struggled to capture accurately. Google's preference for vibrant and colorful photos has often oversaturated these kinds of shots. For instance, in some examples above captured with the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a, the sky is too deep of a blue, or the sand is too deep of an orange.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9a accurately depicts the sand in the photos above as a tan color rather than a clay color. The sky and water are often less vibrant when captured with the Pixel 9a as opposed to older models, but that's for the best. It is the more accurate representation of the environment and could mark a breakthrough for Google.</p><p>I came away incredibly pleased with the fresh take on color science with the Pixel 9a. It's improved not only compared to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a but also compared to the regular Pixel 9.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-ultrawide-macro-photography"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Ultrawide & macro photography</span></h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a's main camera shares specifications with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main camera</a>, which could mean it's the exact same sensor. Regardless, this leads to the Pixel 9a getting the same Macro Focus feature as the Pixel 9 series (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">first added to the Pixel 7 Pro</a>). It intelligently tries to identify and isolate objects that are close to the camera lens, around five centimeters away, using a mix of hardware and software.</p><p>Google has a handful of excellent camera features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, but Macro Focus on the Pixel 9a might be my favorite one yet, and that's a high compliment. The feature isn't perfect—it occasionally blurs a small part of the intended object or not enough of the background. That being said, Macro Focus produces the best macro shots on a phone without a dedicated macro lens.</p>

<p>As you can see in the photos above, the Pixel 9a does a better job at blurring the background than both the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a. It also provides much more detail than older A-series Pixel phones. My favorite Macro Focus shot captured the individual hairs (technically called trichomes) on a tomato plant, as you can see below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="p4iNBBs7tCcLEMDLvNzt6M" name="Pixel-9a-camera-samples-misc-3" alt="A photo captured with the Google Pixel 9a's main camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4iNBBs7tCcLEMDLvNzt6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultrawide camera on the Pixel 9a is the exact same one featured on both the Pixel 8a and the Pixel 7a. It's a 13MP ultrawide lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. Naturally, the Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a produce ultrawide shots with similar levels of detail.</p><p>Once again, the Pixel 9a's improved color science creates a photo that's drastically more accurate than the Pixel 8a despite using the same hardware.</p>

<p>With the primary and ultrawide lenses, you can take photos at optical quality at both 0.5x and 1x zoom. Any further zoom than that will be using digital zoom, with Super Res Zoom available at up to 8x. By contrast, the Pixel 9, which also has two lenses, is able to capture optical quality images at 2x zoom.</p><p>Although its omission is understandable, given the Pixel 9a's price point, it's hard to live without optical-quality zoom at higher levels.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a-low-light-capture"><span>Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a: Low-light capture</span></h2>
<p>It's relatively unsurprising that the Pixel 9a turns in good photos with favorable lighting conditions, but how does it fare when the sun starts to set? This is the area where the Pixel 9a's smaller sensor might start to hurt it compared to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a. The results do confirm that the Pixel 9a has ever-so-slightly less detail in night shots than the prior two generations, but not enough to be meaningful.</p>

<p>Specifically, you start to notice the small dip in detail when looking at something far off in a photo. In the first example photo, you can see the yellow pedestrian crossing sign looks a bit more blurry than the equivalent shots captured by the Pixel 8a and Pixel 7a.</p><p>A similar situation occurs with the barbecue restaurant's lighted sign in the fifth photo. These signs aren't as crisp and clear when captured by the Pixel 9a, but you have to zoom in to notice.</p><p>Night shots were the most hit-or-miss aspect of the Pixel 9a camera system, with some photos turning out perfect and others looking grainy or over-smoothened in processing. Still, you can say that of almost every budget phone's camera system, so this isn't a huge knock on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>If all you care about is raw detail, I could see the argument for preferring the Pixel 8a's main camera sensor. Personally, I think the Pixel 9a's improved color science and Macro Focus mode more than make up for any tiny loss in clarity you might notice.</p>

<p>I was very skeptical of the Google Pixel 9a's camera performance, as the lower megapixel count and smaller sensor size could've led to a drastic drop in detail compared to previous A-series Pixels. However, that didn't turn out to be the case. I've criticized recent Google Pixel cameras for being too vibrant and inaccurate in terms of color science in the past, so it's a big deal to me that this is improved with the Pixel 9a.</p><p>As you can see in the final gallery below, the Pixel 9a can take great shots in a number of situations, performing better the more light there is available.</p>

<p>So, if you're in the market for a Pixel 9a and get spooked by the seemingly-worse camera system, there isn't any reason to panic. The Google Pixel 9a produces photos that are better holistically than both the Pixel 8a and the Pixel 7a. Due to the Pixel 8a's extremely poor color accuracy, the Pixel 9a's camera will be a noticeable improvement year-over-year.</p>

<hr>
<p>MediaTek announces a brand new SoC designed to "raise the bar" of flagship smartphone performance.</p><p>In a press release, the Taiwanese OEM states the new 3nm process Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC takes what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the original 9400</a> did and builds upon it. To begin, the company explains its core structure, which features a Big Core design. With one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz, 3x Cortex-X4 cores, and 4x Cortex-A720 cores, MediaTek claims this chip will propel Android UX experiences.</p><p>The Dimensity 9400 Plus chip features integration with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU. MediaTek states this GPU enables "PC-level features to smartphones with opacity micromap support for realistic effects." In short, the Dimensity 9400 Plus should help bring a more lifelike experience to vegetation, character hair, and animal feathers. These upgrades bring a 40% power efficiency boost to MediaTek's latest chip.</p><p>Additionally, this GPU is said to "double" the effective FPS for phones and boost the chip's power efficiency by 50% for game developers. MediaTek appears confident that this GPU will help reduce gaming lag for users who are playing over longer periods.</p>

<p>As you might expect, MediaTek isn't holding back with its AI advancements with the Dimensity 9400 Plus. The post states the latest upgraded chip brings "exceptional edge-AI performance." Thanks to the NPU 890, the 9400 Plus supports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a> LLM for on-device assistance. MediaTek states its chip is "the first" to incorporate support for R1's four technologies: Mixture of-Experts, Multi-Head Latent Attention, Multi-Token Prediction, and FP8.</p><p>Incorporating these is said to boost the AI's "reasoning speeds." The OEM also worked to improve the chip's generative AI models by 20% over the O.G. 9400.</p><p>In a statement, a MediaTek member said, "The MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ will allow developers to deliver innovative, personalized AI experiences on-device, offering a number of speed and privacy benefits." The chip's built-in Dimensity Agentic AI Engine gives developers an entry point into "sophisticated" agentic AI apps.</p>

<p>There's more to the Dimensity 9400 Plus, such as its focus on enhancing the video recording experience for future users. MediaTek says its chip features Imagiq 1090 for HDR video recording "across the entire zoom range." The company pairs this with its Smooth Zoom technology for "seamless capture" of moving subjects.</p><p>Extra specs include the chip's inclusion of BeiDou satellite connection, which is 60% faster for users looking to utilize its capabilities with your cell signal drops. Phone-to-phone direct Bluetooth connections expand to 8km, which is roughly four times greater than the Dimensity 9400. Consumers will also be able to take advantage of 5G/4G dual-SIM and even greater Wi-Fi coverage.</p><p>MediaTek says its Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC will be available by Q2 2025 for the next wave of smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi announces its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for those creating apps for its upcoming upgrade.</li><li>The preview will provide developers with the tools needed to develop their apps to sort of issues, but it's only accepting the Xiaomi 15 and 14T Pro models.</li><li>Google recently achieved "Platform Stability" with Android 16, meaning its on track to deliver the next major OS in Q2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is in the early stages of Android 16 development, and those creating apps can get a head start, too.</p><p>The Chinese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta">announced</a> the start of its Android 16 Developer Preview Program for early app development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://locationtrackinghub.com/global-android-16-based-hyperos-2-beta/">Location Tracking Hub</a>). Similar to Google, Xiaomi is encouraging interested developers to take part in its preview program, which provides all the tools they will need to "improve the compatibility" and develop their Android 16-supported apps. Interested parties are restricted to a pair of phones to start.</p><p>Xiaomi states its developer preview is accepting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">the 14T Pro</a>.</p><p>The announcement post states developers can get started in one of two ways: a local update or a fastboot update. For the former, devs must ensure their Xiaomi 15 is running OS2.0.109.0.VOCMIXM or higher. Owners of a 14T Pro need to have installed OS2.0.103.0.VNNMIXM or higher. The company has provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta#:~:text=use%20it%20immediately.-,How%20to%20upgrade%EF%BC%9A,-Method%201%3A%20Local">complete guide</a> on "how to" get started with the developer preview.</p><p>Xiaomi's post didn't tease any new features, so it's unclear if developers can expect to see anything new before a more public beta for users drops.</p>

<p>We're nearing the full release of a much earlier Android OS upgrade from Google as Android 16 reached "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Platform Stability</a>." The update in late March marked a major milestone for the next software update as Google progresses with a rapid timeline for the future of Android. Platform Stability means all in-app behaviors have been finalized, and developers are given one last call for final changes to their apps.</p><p>April will hold any last-minute adjustments from Google and developers before it drops in users' hands. Google said, "We’re putting additional energy into working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible." Android 16 is expected to launch by the end of June.</p><p>So, it's no surprise that Xiaomi is getting started on a developer preview of its own while it toils away at its HyperOS Android 16-skin.</p><p>Other OEMs have also started working on their Android 16 versions, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-users-get-android-16-beta-2">OnePlus and its flagship 13 model</a>. Consumers with that device are getting their first glimpse of Android 16 as the company prepares for a rapid launch.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus 13 owners are in for a new experience as the company just announced that it is making Android 16 Beta 2 available to developers and advanced users.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">detailed community post</a>, the company said that it is giving users early access to the latest Android experience. This is the first time that OnePlus has made a beta version of a new OS available to its users. With this release, it "hope(s) to empower app developers and early adopters in our community to build even better software experiences."</p><p>It should be noted that while this is Android 16 Beta 2 (Pixel phones are currently on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Beta 3</a>), this is the first Android 16 beta version available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH" name="Android-16-logo-orange-oneplus-13-01" alt="An orange and blue Android 16 logo on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5yuQ8rnGKn9nvTuvdqmggH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But before you get all excited, it is important to know that this upgrade isn't for new or inexperienced users who are unfamiliar with unstable software versions. And it also isn't for folks who use the OnePlus 13 as their primary device for daily tasks.</p><p>As the community post points out, there are notable bugs and issues that users will come across once they've upgraded to the Android 16 Beta 2. Some of them are that the device may restart when answering a call using Bluetooth headsets, users can encounter lag and display issues in the camera viewfinder and thumbnail in certain scenarios, the phone's camera crashes when switching between different camera modes, specifically the Macro mode and Ultra Steady mode.</p><p>That said, there are other issues that you may come across, making the device lag more than usual.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i" name="oneplus-13-multitasking" alt="Quickly juggling multiple apps on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For those who intend to go ahead with the upgrade, the company cautions users that "<em>there is a risk of bricking your phone"</em><strong> </strong>if they do not follow the upgrade manual to the T.  So it is advised that you back up all the important files on your phone before attempting to upgrade the software.</p><p>Other things to keep in mind during this upgrade are that the phone needs to have at least 30% battery and storage space of more than 4GB. Additionally, the current software version must be <em><strong>15.0.0.703 or below</strong></em> to upgrade to Android 16 Beta 2. "If you're on a higher version, you'll need to <strong>downgrade</strong> first," OnePlus added. Lastly, OnePlus 13 phones on T-Mobile and Verizon carriers are not compatible with the Android 16 Beta 2.</p><p>If you're someone who checks all the above boxes and is ready to give the beta a test drive, then be sure to follow this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1825773890316533761">upgrade guide</a> carefully to be one of the first people to experience Android 16 Beta 2 on OnePlus phones.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's security updates page no longer lists the Galaxy S20 series, meaning its software support has officially come to a close.</li><li>After receiving a "Quarterly" extension in 2024, the S20 flagship trio will no longer be updated; however, the S20 FE can stay a little longer.</li><li>Samsung has shifted to a seven-year support cycle for its phones, but that promise might not embody that sentiment to the core.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While many people coveted the Galaxy S20 series, April marks the end of it in the eyes of Samsung.</p><p>The end of OS and security update support for the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra was made apparent in an updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb">Samsung security updates</a> page (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/08/galaxy-s20-series-out-of-updates/">9to5Google</a>). The once-flagship trio are no longer listed on the company's Monthly, Quarterly, or Biannual update cadence sections. This comes after the Galaxy S20 series was moved from Monthly to Quarterly a year ago during Samsung's software extension era.</p><p>After downloading the March 2025 security patch, users with these phones will (for sure) no longer see an update from Samsung. The publication highlights the possibility of another security update; however, that will likely only be in the most extreme cases for severe vulnerabilities.</p><p>While the S20 trio exits, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review">Galaxy S20 FE</a> (and its 5G variant) remains. The company's security page lists the device under its Quarterly update section. The FE variant is likely in for two more updates, one in Q2 and another in Q3, before it bids farewell, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG" name="galaxy-s20-ultra-lock-screen-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAYPidDdg6gUw4k6UMoksG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S20 series should've come to a close a year ago; however, Samsung announced it would move the devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">from Monthly to Quarterly patches</a> in April 2024. After originally launching in 2020, the Korean OEM promised four years of software support for the trio. The phones would receive three major OS upgrades (Android 10 to 13) and four years of security updates.</p><p>With that, 2024 should've been the end — but Samsung saw otherwise for a selection of devices with quite a short support cycle. Aside from the S20 series and its FE model, Samsung extended support for the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, too. Of course, this only concerned security patches, as none of these devices grabbed Android 14.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">like the Galaxy S24 series</a>, Samsung has moved toward seven years of software support. The Galaxy S25 also received this treatment; however, there's more to unravel for its predecessors as "seven years of support" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">isn't what most users think</a>. In reality, while the S24 will receive Android 21 (in 2031, potentially), the device will likely have to miss out on major One UI features.</p><p>Samsung EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">major toll its AI takes</a> on a phone's hardware in One UI 7. As such, many of its past-gen phones will not receive the next upgrade's Personal Data Engine, as it's far too reliant on the current hardware provided by the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p>

What if the AI assistant in your glasses could help you find them because it <em>remembers</em> where you last placed it? Whether this sounds creepy or not, it's certainly a new kind of superpower, and it's being made possible by an upcoming pair of Android XR smart glasses.</p><p>At TED 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/google-glasses-android-xr-translation">Good Good Good</a>), Google's head of augmented reality and extended reality, Shahram Izadi, debuted a pair of smart glasses that can do just this. We've seen these glasses hinted at before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">during Google I/O</a>, but this is the first time they were shown off live on stage.</p><p>The glasses are powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, Google's latest branch of Android that promises to make eXtended Reality (XR) — the overarching term that includes Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) — as prolific as Wear OS or Android Auto devices. It's possible these are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung HAEAN</a> smart glasses, but Google representatives didn't give a product name at the presentation.</p>

<p>During the presentation, Google product manager Nishtha Bhatia asked Gemini where she had left her hotel room key card, to which the AI promptly responded, "The hotel key card is to the left of the music record" on the shelf behind her. It's not known how long these glasses will be able to record footage during the day or how far this memory feature can go, but it's a killer app for both AI and smart glasses, to say the least.</p><p>The implications of virtual memory can be extraordinarily far-reaching. I think of my own grandparents who suffered from dementia and couldn't remember simple things throughout the day. Glasses like these would profoundly impact their lives, helping to significantly improve their quality of life had they been around to see this.</p><p>Previously, Google showed off this "superpower" during Google I/O 2024 while running an early version of Project Astra on a phone. You can view the original Project Astra demonstration, including the memory feature at timestamp 1:20 in the video below.</p>

<p>Izadi said "These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps," meaning the upcoming smart glasses project from Google will almost certainly only feature light onboard processing to ensure battery longevity. Project Astra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">is launching publicly soon</a> and will likely continue to run on your phone while a pair of smart glasses film the world around you.</p><p>The glasses shown at TED 2025 included a display in at least one of the lenses, although that particular functionality was only shown off briefly for a live translation demo where words were displayed on the lenses. We learned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">back in August 2023</a> that Google was working on several different pairs of smart glasses, including a pair with a single display and another pair with two displays — one in each lens.</p><p>This all comes as news surrounding next-generation smart glasses has been heating up. Meta is said to be debuting a next-gen Ray-Ban branded pair of smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">with a single display</a> this year, including a wristband <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">that allows phoneless interaction</a> with what you see on the glasses display.</p>

<p>We haven't heard of Google working on a similar wristband, which means the company will likely rely heavily on Gemini to control most of the interaction. I saw Project Astra firsthand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">at Google I/O last year</a> and came away impressed with the AI's capabilities to understand spatial relationships and interpret what it sees through a camera.</p><p>Google will be using this exact functionality in their smart glasses when they debut, although it's not known if this particular pair will be part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-from-android-xr-in-2025">2025 Android XR lineup</a> or if we'll need to wait for next year to see them hit shelves.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s foldables have been a bit underwhelming lately, but 2025 could finally bring some big upgrades.</li><li>The Z Fold 7 might get an improved under-display camera and a tougher, more durable screen with new materials.</li><li>It might feature a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover display, up from the Z Fold 6’s 7.6-inch and 6.3-inch screens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s foldable crowd hasn’t exactly been blown away by the slow drip of upgrades. However, it’s looking like things might finally take a real turn in 2025.</p><p>A new report says that Samsung’s foldables might be in for a major glow-up in 2025. According to @TheGalox_ on X, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> could show up with an upgraded under-display camera and a tougher screen built with some fresh layered materials.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold7 | What's new?• One UI 8 out of the box• Upgraded Under Display Camera• Stronger Display with new layers• Bigger at 8" inside & 6.5" outside • New 200mp main camera • Thinner body at 4.5mm unfolded • Improved water & dust resistance • Smaller crease… pic.twitter.com/1zzVMwDJNE<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1909739032264728931">April 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223826994201&navType=by" target="_blank">buzz</a> that Samsung has been struggling to fine-tune its Under Display Camera tech both in terms of performance and keeping costs in check. So while the Z Fold 7 is still expected to pack a UDC, Samsung is reportedly already eyeing other options for future models.</p>
<h2 id="under-display-camera-last-hurrah-2">Under Display Camera – last hurrah?</h2>
<p>Funny enough, Samsung and Apple might be on the same page for once: both seem to be pumping the brakes on under-display cameras. If the rumors are right, the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and future flagships could ditch UDC entirely.</p><p>@TheGalox_ also backed up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-one-ui-8-preloaded/" target="_blank">recent report</a> claiming both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are set to ship with One UI 8 right out of the box.</p><p>Even though Samsung fans weren’t too thrilled with how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> (Android 15) turned out, there’s a lot more hope riding on the next version of its custom UI.</p><p>Samsung seems to be moving pretty fast with its next software update, and it lines up with Android 16’s expected rollout. Google is aiming to drop the big update around June, after a round of beta testing.</p><p>The tipster also spilled some details about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 getting a size boost. Rumor has it the main foldable screen could stretch to 8 inches, with the cover display hitting 6.5 inches.</p><p>For comparison, the Z Fold 6 sports a 7.6-inch inner screen and a 6.3-inch outer one.</p><p>There's also a good chance the next model could come with an upgraded main camera, possibly hitting 200MP. That’s a major jump from the 50MP sensor in the current version.</p>
<h2 id="performance-and-durability-upgrades-2">Performance and durability upgrades</h2>
<p>Inside, the next foldable is expected to pack the faster Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. As for durability, the rumor points to a higher IP rating for better dust and water resistance. For comparison, the current Z Fold 6 has an IP48 rating, so the new model could come with even tougher protection against the elements.</p><p>The new device might have a slimmer design, possibly as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded. There’s also talk of a smoother fold, with less of a noticeable crease on the inside screen.</p><p>On top of that, a bigger vapor chamber is expected, which would help keep things cool during heavy tasks like gaming, improving long-term performance.</p>

<hr>
<p>While we await Samsung's personal robot reveal, the company is highlighting a new partnership to expand its AI capabilities later this summer.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-google-cloud-expand-partnership-bring-gemini-ballie-home-ai-companion-robot-by-samsung/">press release</a>, Samsung announced a new partnership with Google Cloud, which will bring the Gemini model to the personal home companion, Ballie. Samsung's executive vice president of the visual display business, Yongjae Kim, said, "By pairing Gemini’s powerful multimodal reasoning with Samsung’s AI capabilities in Ballie, we’re leveraging the power of open collaboration to unlock a new era of personalized AI companion."</p><p>For consumers, the post says Ballie will leverage Gemini's multimodal software alongside Samsung's language models to "process and understand a variety of inputs." Ballie is said to understand/process audio and the user's voice. Additionally, the AI companion can process visual data from its camera and sensor data from its environment.</p><p>With Gemini and Samsung's software, Ballie's behavior and responses are expected to "adapt in real-time."</p>
<h2 id="ballie-has-your-back-2">Ballie has your back</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk" name="samsung-ballie-house-roaming" alt="An image of Samsung's upcoming yellow Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor by a sofa." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZ7Ro2xyyD6yFS2E5uMgYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung states this partnership with Google should move Ballie into a personal position, allowing users to seek help for a variety of subjects. The post highlights Ballie's ability to help users with fashion choices in the morning. Samsung gives the following example: "Hey Ballie, how do I look?" The AI robot will reportedly examine you through its camera before offering a set of "styling recommendations," which could include accessories or an entirely new top.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ballie features health and wellness assistance. If a user is tired, Samsung says it can express this to the AI robot. Ballie will then use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's Search engine abilities</a> to find how best to improve its users' energy levels.</p><p>Samsung confirms Ballie is preparing to launch "this summer" in the U.S. and South Korea. While the post highlights more personal AI assistance, the little yellow ball will also aid in smart home tasks like adjusting your lights, answering the door, setting reminders, and more. Samsung states it's still finalizing product specifications, so more concrete information about Ballie will be made available at a later time.</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/projectors/home-robot-ballie/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">sign up for Ballie updates</a> to stay in the loop.</p><p>Samsung first teased Ballie in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">a promo video five years ago,</a> during CES 2020. We got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">surprising update about it</a> earlier this year in January from Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, who said Ballie is preparing to launch in the U.S. and South Korea. However, Han Jong-hee stated the robot would see a "first half" of 2025 launch, which remains to be seen. If true, then Ballie would have to debut sometime between now and June.</p>

As exciting as that was, it didn't lead to a consistent user experience, so it's understandable that brands have tried to focus on that area in the last three years. Samsung in particular doesn't make many changes to One UI, eschewing constant change for familiarity. <br><br>That's what makes the One UI 7 update that much more notable; this is Samsung's biggest UI overhaul in a while, and it delivers an overall aesthetic that's cleaner, more modern, and with better customizability than ever before. Samsung clearly had issues managing the scale of the changes — most of its flagships still haven't picked up the Android 15-based update — but it is undeniable that One UI 7 heralds a new era of Samsung's software vision. <br><br>I started out with TouchWiz Nature UX 2.0 on the Galaxy S4, and used every subsequent version of Samsung's interface released over the last decade, including all One UI iterations. Here's what I think of One UI 7, and why I believe it is a pivotal update for Samsung's devices.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-gets-a-much-needed-ui-overhaul"><span>One UI 7 gets a much-needed UI overhaul</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UwMjVfTLSekVMKi5UTRGS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung overhauled the interface with One UI 7, and it is a positive move overall. The interface now looks cleaner and has better colors throughout, and it is cohesive. Samsung tweaked the design of the icons as well, and they have better gradation and look a little more elegant. There's better customizability in this area as well, with One UI 7 allowing you to change the size of icons and disable text labels (finally).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8y95DFkNxAKAQWLSiL2Y6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Widgets are cleaner too, and the changes to the design make using One UI 7 that much more enjoyable. That said, Samsung maintained the right balance; while the UI looks modern, it's still immediately familiar. Samsung didn't make wholesale changes to how you  interact with the interface, instead updating elements that started showing their age.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQocE8cZrRGBY5dEnE2qY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the design tweaks are motivated by iOS, and there's no getting around that — most Android brands are guilty of doing this. Having said that, the implementation is quite different to what you get on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and Samsung did a good job "borrowing" some of these utilities and integrating them into its own interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBuK2kmYnx8tuK7Wn8EkK6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A smaller update has to do with the battery; the icon in the status bar has a cleaner pill-sized design, but what I like the most is that it houses the percentage within the icon. This was a bugbear on One UI 6.1.1 as the percentage sat outside the icon, so it's good to see Samsung making this move.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vgD7GKCtitfmccLASo3ZX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another small tweak has to do with enlarged folders. This is something that ColorOS and MagicOS do really well, and Samsung is now aiming to follow suit. With bigger folders, you don't need to go into a folder to launch an app that's located inside, and it is highly convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43e7yMFvxHxZY2QZdL2GX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a new Game Booster that lets you tweak settings in individual titles to maximize efficiency or performance, and it makes a difference. Galaxy AI continues to be a differentiator, and Samsung is building out a decent set of utilities in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgiErQzYCdKBPFMeCw7XX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UI has better optimization, and that in turns means you get better fluidity even on mid-range devices like the Galaxy A56, where this has been a constant problem with previous iterations. That said, it doesn't quite have the same level of fluidity as ColorOS on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> or even Xiaomi's latest software running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, but it is a decent change in the context of Samsung phones.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-has-a-split-notification-pane"><span>One UI 7 has a split notification pane</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyjtVvD8GaKPQdHvbRoWT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference in One UI 7 has to do with the notification pane; Samsung now uses a split shade with the toggles sitting on one side, and the notifications on the other. This is similar to iOS' Control Center, and most Chinese brands are also using a similar system. The pane isn't fully opaque, and it does a good job highlighting the background colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZehJq5GU2mToGa2htS8iT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, you can switch back to a unified pane if that's what you prefer. While that's what I usually do on most Android phones, I found myself liking the split pane quite a bit; you get a greater number of controls in the toggles section, and a pull-down gesture anywhere on the screen surfaces the notification shade — to get to the toggles, you'll need to pull down from the top right corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The split pane shows volume control in addition to the standard brightness slider, and you get the usual smart home device controls and Modes (what Routines is now dubbed). You can switch between notifications and toggles by swiping right and left, and Samsung did all the right things in this regard.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-actually-added-a-vertically-scrolling-app-drawer"><span>Samsung actually added a vertically-scrolling app drawer</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L8Ao2eEm4nNu7kfcU5EzN6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about One UI 7 is the introduction of a vertically-scrolling app drawer. Samsung was the only holdout to still use a horizontal app drawer, and it was constantly frustrating whenever I used one of its phones. I had to use Good Lock to switch to a vertically-scrolling drawer, and that was usually one of the first things I changed on Samsung's devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2H7fp6DmjohkCg5HUdAoY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With One UI 7 though, you don't need to go that route; the drawer scrolls vertically as standard, and it is a minor change that makes a big difference in usability — particularly if you're like me and have plenty of apps installed. Another positive change is the positioning of the search bar within the drawer; it is now located at the bottom, and that makes it easier to pull up.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-now-bar-provides-contextual-info-in-one-ui-7"><span>Now Bar provides contextual info in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuXshukwQzpSUFBdhaT2a6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like every other manufacturer, Samsung is emulating iOS' Dynamic Island, but because the Korean brand has to be different, its implementation is unlike that of any other device. The feature is dubbed Now Bar, and is basically shows things like media controls, timer, recorder, navigation, and other ongoing actions in a pill-sized box that sits at the bottom of the lock screen.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can interact with these actions without having to wake the screen, and I used it to good effect to control music playback in YouTube Music. Samsung has a secondary option called Live Notifications that sit in the status bar, and they do a similar thing — you can control music playback and other actions by selecting the icon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nSi9J5EderDC8UUvbERKG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most devices, these notifications aren't centered around the camera cutout, but sit to a side in the status bar. ColorOS does a better job handling these notifications, and Samsung needs to tweak the design a little bit in this area.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-overview-menu-is-much-better-in-one-ui-7"><span>The Overview menu is much better in One UI 7</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDfiPkx4rzrYxPEYAKq9Q6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also changed the overview menu, and it has much better usability. Instead of one card dominating the view, you get a rolodex-like design that lets you preview cards in the background, and it is a much-needed change. The scrolling action when going through the recents menu is smoother as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Samsung hasn't changed the option to launch split-screen mode via the Overview menu. You can still press on an app icon and choose to go into split-screen mode effortlessly, and this is another small area where One UI has an advantage over its Android rivals.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-gets-a-brand-new-camera-interface"><span>One UI 7 gets a brand-new camera interface</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsstohWf2ccfqGsDMnTo56.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the rest of the interface, Samsung cleaned up the camera UI, and it is much better organized. The shooting modes have been moved to the bottom of the viewfinder, and it's easier to switch between modes with your thumb. Most of the toggles and filters are hidden behind a settings button, and this ensures the interface isn't anywhere as cluttered.</p>
<p>Alongside better controls, you get good editing tools, and like every other brand, Samsung is leveraging AI to be the differentiator.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-battery-controls-higher-drain"><span>Better battery controls, higher drain</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YryCTAUTmQMYWbTXM9oHZ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the One UI 7 beta builds in the past, and there was a noticeable decrease in battery life over One UI 6.1.1 on the S24+. This is still the case when I used the stable One UI 7 build on the Galaxy A56; the phone didn't last quite as long as its immediate rivals with equivalent batteries, so it's clear that Samsung needs to do additional tweaks to deliver better battery efficiency.</p>
<p>Samsung lags behind every other Android brand when it comes to battery tech, both in terms of charging and willingness to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide tech</a> to deliver better density. But what I like is that battery protections are better in One UI 7; you can now set a charging limit and customize it between 80% to 95%, giving you much greater flexibility.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-is-slowly-making-its-way-to-the-best-samsung-phones"><span>One UI 7 is slowly making its way to the best Samsung phones</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d6iA7G4eDKNXdcXW3ZGnX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d6iA7G4eDKNXdcXW3ZGnX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is usually good with updates, but that just hasn't been the case with One UI 7. As of April 9, my Galaxy S24+ still hasn't picked up the stable One UI 7 build, and it is the only 2024 flagship to not make the switch to Android 15. Samsung clearly had challenges in getting the Android 15 build out the door, and it will only take longer for the brand's budget and mid-range devices to switch to the latest version of Android.</p>
<p>With Google accelerating the Android 16 launch, Samsung's delay means most of its devices will pick up Android 15 just as the next version of Android becomes available.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-ui-7-is-a-great-overall-update"><span>One UI 7 is a great overall update</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kdJBmAimRUQpAsC3QQQhE6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdJBmAimRUQpAsC3QQQhE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The definition of a good update is when a brand introduces meaningful additions while still retaining the core feature-set, and Samsung did a great job nailing that balance with One UI 7. The changes to the design bring a level of vibrancy and dynamism to the interface, and it has better fluidity on mid-range devices. <br><br>The fundamentals are unchanged, so if you're used to call recording in the dialer, Samsung Internet, Samsung Messages, and the brand's unique customization options, those are still just as good as previous iterations of the interface. Ultimately, the only problem with One UI 7 is just how long it is taking to show up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>. But having used it for a while now, I can say that it is worth the wait.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding a new version of Gemini to Android Studio that's specifically designed for businesses.</li><li>The exclusive tier prevents Google from saving company code, which won't be used for AI model training.</li><li>Google will also protect companies from IP claims against code created with the help of Gemini in Android Studio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is introducing a new version of Gemini in Android Studio tailored for businesses that need AI coding help, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/gemini-in-android-studio-for-business.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today. The upgraded offering, available with Gemini Code Assist Standard or Enterprise subscriptions, adds security and intellectual property (IP) protections to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features already available.</p><p>The feature set includes many Gemini in Android Studio staples, like build and sync error support, Gemini-powered App Quality Insights, and Compose Preview Generation. On a larger scale, Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/reported-changes-to-android-development-arent-really-a-change">Android Studio</a> is supposed to help app developers work through the process of creating and maintaining an Android app. This version in particular is intended to address some of the concerns business owners and enterprises might have using AI to help with their apps.</p><p>These tools can be customized to match a company's internal codebase by linking to GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repositories.</p><p>Notably, unlike other Gemini offerings, no code created with Gemini in Android Studio for businesses is stored with Google. Additionally, code isn't used to train new AI models. Using the Private Google Access, VPC Service Controls, and Enterprise Access Controls security features, businesses can completely control how their code is used and safeguarded.</p>

<p>Corporate IT departments may be pleased to learn that Gemini in Android Studio for businesses meets the following industry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">security certifications</a>:</p>
<ul><li>SOC 1/2/3, ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)</li><li>27017 (Cloud Security)</li><li>27018 (Protection of PII)</li><li>27701 (Privacy Information Management)</li></ul>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Google is providing companies with peace-of-mind with IP indemnification.</p><p>"Organizations will benefit from generative AI IP indemnification, safeguarding their organizations against third parties claiming copyright infringement related to the AI-generated code," Google explains. "This added layer of protection is the same indemnification policy we provide to Google Cloud customers using our generative AI APIs, and allows their developers to leverage the power of AI with greater confidence and reduced risk."</p><p>Companies interested in trying out this enterprise-grade version of Gemini in Android Studio can download the Android Studio Narwhal build from the Canary release channel. They'll also need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adds-free-gemini-code-assist-tier-with-180-000-monthly-code-completions">active, eligible Gemini Code Assist license</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There's a rising trend of minimalist phones, with more and more of these hybrid oddities coming out recently. Unlike dumbphones, modern minimal phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-light-phone-3-is-here-with-miniature-features-massive-usd799-price-tag">Light Phone 3</a> and Minimal Phone come with Android and support a wide variety of the latest mobile apps.</p><p>So, what keeps them minimal? None of these minimalist devices have colored displays, making them non-intrusive and less distracting. They also have a limited OS and functionality, but not to the extent of dumbphones. Some of them don't even use a touch screen, like the Light Phone 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt MP02</a>, favoring old-school keypads for input instead.</p><p>I find that this new-school variety of minimal phones is more appropriate for the current world as opposed to a dumbphone like the Nokia 2780.</p>
<h2 id="dumbphones-are-much-too-limited-for-today-2">Dumbphones are much too limited for today</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZUXh3ryJrZtUCQvi5xC4XU" name="Light-Phone-3-1" alt="The Light Phone III in lifestyle photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZUXh3ryJrZtUCQvi5xC4XU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Light Phone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why would anyone want a "less smart" phone, you ask? We're always distracted by our smartphones these days, and issues like doom-scrolling seriously kill motivation and focus. There is a small niche of people who don't want to be immersed in social media and be connected all the time, everywhere they go.</p><p>There are also other niches of older, more senior individuals who find modern flagships to be too complex, as well as kids who are much too young to have a full-fledged Android or iOS smartphone. Many people also like to have a secondary basic phone for times when they need to take a break from the internet and social media.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone">Dumbphones</a> are just nice for these groups of people, but they are extremely limited in their capabilities as they don't come with Android. While this is by design, the modern world demands a more balanced approach for such users.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-phones-offer-a-more-balanced-approach-2">Minimalist phones offer a more balanced approach</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4351px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9" name="minimal-phone-lifestyle-2" alt="Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MC6mD7F22YUeAT2rj5jLa9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4351" height="2447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Minimal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the Minimal Phone, for example. It started out as a concept device based on E Ink devices and Blackberry phones. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/minimal-phone-concept">passing the design phase in January 2024</a>, the Minimal Phone finally started shipping on April 3, 2025 and can be purchased for $399.99. It's affordable, comes with Android 14, and has all the most desirable functions, such as a mic, speakers, a headphone jack, USB-C charging, GPS, and connectivity via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and cellular.</p><p>The Minimal Phone even has a camera, and you can install apps like WhatsApp, Uber, and Venmo on it. But it's nowhere near as interactive or distracting as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> because the B&W display lacks color and has no touchscreen. Since it uses an E Ink display, it has amazing battery life, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-readers and e-paper tablets</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NopNgUTd3FtGP9etuqavbG" name="Punkt-MP02-lifestyle" alt="Punkt.

<p>In fact, minimalist phones don't even sacrifice durability. The Punkt MP02 sports a regular TFT display, albeit still devoid of color, and what's more impressive is that it has an IP52 splash and dust-resistant rating.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-have-connectivity-but-still-disconnect-2">You can have connectivity but still disconnect</h2>
<p>Minimalist phones are all about intentional connectivity and balance. They offer peace of mind and the option to be on the grid — when you choose to do so. Unlike dumbphones, you can access a vast range of apps and tools, so you're not cut off entirely.</p><p>Despite the added functionality, minimalist phones still manage to disconnect from the fast pace of life. You don't get bombarded with information all the time, and you only log on to social media and the internet on your terms.</p><p>The muted monochrome screen brings solace to the chaos and busyness of feature-rich smartphones with all the bells and whistles imaginable. You're not tempted to constantly watch reels or TikTok videos. It's also very kind to your eyes, contributing to a more comfortable and relaxed user experience.</p><p>I truly believe that this is the right formula for a non-intrusive, uncomplex phone in 2025 as opposed to a dumbphone. It's a great way to slow down and take a breather without handicapping yourself from crucial tools important for everyday life.</p>

Sometimes, you'll get a great new feature that becomes an indispensable part of your everyday life. Other times, your favorite feature might get removed, never to see the light of day until 10 years later when something old becomes new again.</p><p>Case in point is widgets, a major feature of Android 1.0 that saw a significant decline in popularity after Google got rid of lock screen widgets in Android 5. But, as expected, what's old is new again. With the release of Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, lock screen widgets are becoming cool again. So much so, in fact, that Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/widgets-take-center-stage-with-samsung-oneui7.html">latest Android Developers blog post</a> focuses on how important widgets are for user engagement. Imagine that.</p><p>We first saw the groundwork being laid for lock screen widgets in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-lock-screen-widgets-spotted">beta build of Android 14</a>, followed by a full rollout of the feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> last September. More phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-widgets-to-phone-lock-screens-with-android-16-qpr1">will be getting the feature</a> with a quarterly update of Android 16, but Samsung is beating everyone else to the punch by including it on every device that has access to One UI 7 this year.</p>

<p>Google's renewed interest in widgets really started to pop on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> last year when it launched a redesigned Pixel Weather app, which prominently featured widgets of all kinds. These widgets weren't just gorgeous looking; they also made it easy to see and understand a plethora of data at a glance.</p><p>While you can't break these widgets out of the app and place them individually on your home screen or lock screen (classic Google), many other apps are starting to take widgets more seriously, and Google Play is adapting. Developers can now show their app widgets right on the Play Store listing, and users can search specifically for apps that include widgets by using a handy filter.</p><p>I use widgets every single day to quickly take notes or access individual notes, control media playback with a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> widget, search Google with text or visually with the Google widget, check my weekly meal plan with Our Groceries, quickly start by Roborock robot vacuum routines with a tap, and scroll through my calendar without having to find the app first.</p>

<p>But what I'm really interested in now is relearning how to use lock screen widgets again. These died in the Android 5 days when biometrics were becoming more commonplace as people stopped using their lock screens in favor of unlocking straight to the home screen. Things have changed, though, and we've learned to like our lock screens again.</p><p>Having separate widgets on the lock screen gives us one more surface to custom-tailor our day, and I know exactly what's going to be on there. That dedicated YouTube Music widget will always be on the lock screen, so I don't have to wonder if the OS is smart enough to know what I want.</p><p>A dedicated flashlight button alongside a handful of smart home toggles will await a single press from my thumb for activation, and a quick glance at the Strava health data from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will keep me motivated to get moving. Oh, and don't forget the quick voice memo button in Google Keep that makes it handy to take a note at any time.</p><p>Meanwhile, my home screen will be reserved for more sensitive data like actual, scrollable notes, a quick glance at the latest emails and messages that just came in, as well as a little photo frame filled with my favorite memories. Widgets are wonderful, and I'm beyond delighted to see Google start caring about them again, especially in a day in age when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/good-lock-one-ui-7-update-is-great">Good Lock</a> makes it easy to fully customize the living crap out of my home and lock screens!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages is rolling out a built-in “Unsubscribe” button to give you an easy way to shut down those automated texts for good.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-unsubscribe-button-3542411/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a fresh new feature popping up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. It's a little prompt at the end of spammy texts that says, “unsubscribe to stop receiving messages.” Once you tap it, you’ll get a quick pop-up asking why you’re opting out.</p><p>Google Messages has been on top of spam control for a while now. When a shady-looking text comes in, the app drops a little option letting you block the sender or report them on the spot. Tap it, and you’ll get a quick popup asking if you want to include a report before making it final.</p><p>The updated interface introduces a straightforward "Unsubscribe" button. When you tap it, a quick explanation pops up, letting you know it'll send a "Stop" message to the sender, telling them to back off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.20%;"><img id="NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL" name="Google-Messages-new-unsubscribe-option" alt="Google Messages' new unsubscribe option to stop spam texts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NY54MzNproMrgohLPq7FeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="522" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you do get the option, you’ll be asked to pick from five reasons for opting out: “not signed up,” “too many messages,” “no longer interested,” “spam,” or “other. It gives you a bit more control over why you’re saying goodbye to those texts.</p>
<h2 id="oops-changed-your-mind-2">Oops, changed your mind?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve unsubscribed, you’ll see a “unsubscribe request sent” notice right under the “Stop” message. Furthermore, a “Start” button will pop up in the bottom-right corner, giving you the option to resubscribe to those automated texts if you change your mind later.</p><p>Google also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/release-notes#march_25_2025" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that this feature is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-will-help-you-thwart-ads-and-spam-in-a-future-update">rolling out for RCS Business Messages</a>, and it's already being tested with users in the Google Messages beta program. At the moment, it’s focused on a few regions, including the U.S., UK, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Mexico, and Spain.</p><p>It’s pretty surprising that a feature this simple has taken so long to roll out. But if you haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry since it’s still being rolled out.</p>

<ul><li>A new leak revealed the alleged prices of Google's next flagship lineup.</li><li>It claims that the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL will see a $100 price hike this time around, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may drop to $1,600.</li><li>The Pixel line (standard Pixel, two Pro models, and one foldable) will allegedly remain the same until 2028.</li><li>The Google Pixel A-series will also be sold at the same price, $499 through 2028.</li></ul>

<p>Google Pixel 10 series rumors have been popping up a lot lately, with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked"> official renders </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">specs</a> leaking way ahead of time. But the latest leak comes from “sources familiar with Google’s plans," both for the Pixel 10 model and the phones to come in the future.</p><p>A lengthy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/author/alexander-maxham"> report </a>by Android Headlines claims that some models' pricing will change every year for the Google Pixel flagship series, while the others will stay at the same price point, at least until 2028.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-front-back" alt="A leaked look at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold rendering, showcasing its full internal display and rear panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDmQwNgra4KCpxoDJ4CWEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, the publication claims that the next flagship model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>, will see some price changes. While the standard and smaller Pro models will hold the same prices from the previous year, it looks like the Pixel Pro XL will see a $ $100 price bump. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will allegedly get a $200 reduction in its price, bringing its price tag to $1600, which is in line with a previous rumor we spotted earlier this month.</p><p>Next up is the A-series, or Google's budget devices. Android Headlines claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> will be sold at the same $499 price point as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>. Furthermore, the company will reportedly stick to the same price until 2028 with the Pixel 12a.</p><p>Ultimately, it looks like Google has no plans to switch up its lineup any time soon, even though we feel future Pixel A and base Pixel models should be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">merged into one phone</a>, bringing a device somewhere in the middle with the best of both worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm" name="Google-pixel-9a-pixel-9-3" alt="The Pixel 9a and Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FLdumVShuzvyLrfbXuMHm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thus, as for Google's flagship phone plans for the future, the report states that Google will stick to releasing a base model, two Pro phones, a foldable, and a budget device every single year up until 2028.</p><p>This contradicts some rumors that the tech giant would let go of the smaller Pro model sometime in the future. However, according to Android Headlines, this won't happen at least for the next three years.</p><p>Lastly, sources privy to Google's plans told the publication that as the years go by, Google's foldables will also start getting cheaper. “The Pixel Fold model will actually drop in price by the time we get to 2028," Android Headlines stated. It further goes to say that the 2027 Pixel Pro Fold model will see a lower price point of $1500, as the news site assumes Google could be using less expensive hardware for these phones.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1juga19/comment/mm235rh">Comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>However, these are still leaks and are subject to a lot of changes in the future. Considering U.S. tariffs are at play even when it comes to electronics, it is hard to say how many of these claims are actually true.</p><p>In a separate Reddit post, someone  from Android Headlines said that they've seen the pricing for Pixel 10, 11, 12, and 13 series, but “it’s all subject to change” and that “everything is a rumor until the company announces it lol.”</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out Loss of Pulse Detection to Pixel Watch 3 owners in the U.S. starting today.</li><li>The feature, which is opt-in, will automatically check if your pulse is detected and call emergency services if it can't be found.</li><li>This life-saving tool will take a couple of weeks to become available for all Pixel Watch 3 users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is now rolling out Loss of Pulse Detection, a new safety feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, to U.S. users. The feature was originally marketed as a Pixel Watch 3 feature last year, and became available in other regions, but required FDA approval before it could work in the U.S.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">earned that approval in February 2025</a>, and Loss of Pulse Detection will become available in the country starting today, with a full rollout lasting a few weeks.</p><p>After earning FDA approval, the company announced Loss of Pulse Detection for U.S. users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">as part of the March Pixel Feature Drop</a>. Originally, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-fda/" target="_blank">said</a> it would "begin rolling it out in the U.S. at the end of March." That deadline passed, but now the feature is shipping as of April 8, 2025.</p><p>Loss of Pulse Detection is a critical safety feature that Google explains can "detect when you’ve experienced a loss of pulse" and "automatically prompt a call to emergency services for potentially life-saving care if you’re unresponsive." It adds a new element to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-extra-step-for-emergency-sos-on-the-pixel-watch-is-now-available">Emergency SOS</a>, which can be used to call emergency services quickly from your smartwatch.</p>

<p>Loss of Pulse Detection is opt-in, so you'll need to manually enable it when the feature becomes available on your device. To do so, open the <strong>Google Pixel Watch app</strong> on your phone and tap <strong>Safety and Emergency</strong>. Then, press <strong>Loss of Pulse Detection</strong>, and follow the on-screen prompts to enable the safety tool. After that, the feature will monitor your heart rate and try to detect when and if your pulse can't be found.</p><p>Prior to launching in the U.S., Loss of Pulse Detection has been available in 14 countries. The feature first arrived on Pixel Watch 3 for users in the EU last year.</p><p>It's rolling out starting today, but may take "a couple" of weeks before it arrives on all U.S. Pixel Watch 3 devices. The announcement comes as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-pixel-watch-models">Google releases the April 2025 update</a> for all Pixel Watch models.</p>

<p>Curiously, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">isn't the first time</a> we've heard rumors of the Galaxy S25 Edge's supposed launch date. Originally, there was speculation that the phone would debut in April; however, rumors quickly refuted that, stating Samsung may seek a May or June release. The report earlier this month stated the company had reportedly provided such launch details to telecom providers in South Korea to prepare them.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks">listing in the Netherlands</a> showed the S25 Edge would've launched on April 15, but the strange delay has seemingly cropped up without much insight into why. With current rumors alleging a late May," perhaps a June launch is more likely for consumers in other regions, like the U.S.</p><p>Additional rumors state the phone measures ~5.8mm in thickness with a 6.7-inch display. While unconfirmed, there's strong speculation that Samsung could provide the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the S25 Edge like its flagship trio. Elsewhere, rumors may have given us an idea about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s25-edge-might-surprise-with-higher-prices-for-certain-models">phone's pricing range</a> for its models. It seems consumers should brace for 12GB of RAM paired with 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>However, the prices could vary for each. A report states the 256GB option could debut between €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400). This could jump slightly for the 512GB as it could receive a €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520) starting price. Users may also have a choice between Titanium Icy Blue, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Silver for colors.</p>

<ul><li>Google is going after businesses that try to cheat the system with fake five-star reviews.</li><li>In its recent report, Google said it has trained Gemini to detect businesses that try to cheat the system by buying fake five-star reviews.</li><li>Additionally, it is issuing warnings to repeat offenders within the Google Maps app while temporarily disabling reviews for some.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be going after businesses and establishments that have fake five-star reviews with the help of Gemini.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-business-profiles-ai-fake-reviews/#:~:text=Our%20progress%20in%202024,that%20repeatedly%20violated%20our%20policies.">Keyword</a> blog, Google explained how AI was able to track down over 10,000 listings managed by a group of "bad actors who impersonated real locksmiths to take over unclaimed Business Profiles and overcharge unsuspecting customers."</p><p>People rely on Google Maps for all sorts of information, from helping with navigation to looking up the best businesses in their area. When you look up a new restaurant you'd want to explore, you'd first check its reviews to see how it compares to the rest and trust that these reviews have been penned down by genuine people who've visited the place.</p><p>This is why Google has been after businesses trying to trick customers into visiting their locations with fake five-star reviews from people who have not been to the establishments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh" name="Google-Maps-Fake-reviews-alert" alt="Alerts on Google Maps disabling reviews for a business" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d8zfTTjiAXzmvpsXrYWzFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It even seems to have trained a specific Gemini model that will also detect businesses that suddenly change their category. For instance if a cafe turned into a plumbing service, Gemini will identify it as a potentially suspicious profile.</p><p>"This new model has already helped us block thousands of suspicious Business Profile edits this year," the company said in the post.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini is now able to detect fake reviews on establishments several months after the user posted the original review. The tech giant stated that Gemini can "now revisit reviews more frequently to identify new abuse patterns. "</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-google-maps-03.jpg" alt="Viewing Google Maps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4's smaller cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERpQEgeCnpxkoeG283bSR6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, on the business front, the company is issuing alerts to business profiles in the U.S., U.K., and India when fake engagements or reviews are detected. This will be in the form of a banner alert within the app that states, "Google recently removed suspicious five-star reviews" from their profiles.</p><p>Lastly, if certain users are repeat offenders of fake engagement, Google says it will either temporarily disable their ability to post reviews or temporarily hide reviews for that establishment.</p><p>Google stated that in 2024, Gemini detected over 240 million policy-violating reviews, 70 million edits to places on Maps, and 12 million fake Business Profiles. These profiles were either blocked or removed, and posting restrictions were placed on over 900,000 accounts for repeated policy violations.</p>

<p>Easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market today, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a versatile device with a powerful Snapdragon chipset, pocketable form factor, and seven-year software promise. Buy the phone at Samsung today and you'll be eligible for up to $750 of trade-in credit or $150 off if you select No Trade-in. You'll also get access to a few exclusive color variants that you can't find anywhere else!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f741uakaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f62fb152-f14e-49d8-be7f-83a9fa7c0feb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 256GB: $1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While we wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> to arrive later this year, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is one of the best clamshell-style phones that money can buy, coming complete with a custom Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, two vibrant AMOLED displays, and all of the latest Gemini and Galaxy AI software features. You&apos;ll also get seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed, and as we note in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, a nearly-invisible display crease. </p><p>If you&apos;re interested in going the trade-in route with this deal, it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung is being pretty generous with the old or broken phones that it accepts. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5 will get you the max $750 off, while older phones dating back to the Galaxy S22 Ultra will land you a stellar $500 discount. Buying from Samsung also gets you a few free entertainment services, such as six months of SiriusXM, three months of Peacock Premium, and more. </p><p>Again, if you prefer using the latest and greatest technology, I&apos;d probably wait to see what preorder deals are announced when the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is revealed (presumably in July or August). But if you simply want an awesome flip phone ASAP, this Samsung deal presents a unique opportunity. </p>

<ul><li>The Onyx Boox Page is receiving a version 4.0 update that refines the screen-touching experience for readers.</li><li>Boox rolls in a host of Library and NeoReader updates, too, that add customization to the Library View" and "List" settings.</li><li>The update is rolling out with a 338MB download size.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Boox is rolling out an update for its 2024 e-reader that packs bug fixes as well as new updates to improve its reading experience.</p><p>The update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Onyx Boox Page</a> was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich this morning (Apr. 8), marked as v4.0. Users looking to update should begin noticing it today; however, it arrives as a 338MB download. Boox provided its entire changelog, which begins with a few System updates. The company is improving the system UI interfaces and the operation feedback prompts.</p><p>For the latter, Boox says this should make screen-touching "more intuitive and accurate." Additionally, users will find the option to enable and disable "full refresh" when returning to the home screen. Boox states users can find it by heading into <strong>Settings > Display > Full Refresh When Back to Home Screen</strong>.</p><p>The Library and NeoReader pick up a few updates, too. The patch notes detail the ability to now "customize the top function bar of the Library." Users can re-order its provided function <strong>Library Settings > Library List Settings</strong>. "Library View" gains an easy switch button in the lower right-hand corner of the library. Additionally, Boox has added customizable Reading Themes, letting users change the font, margin, spacing, and background color.</p><p>A more "intuitive" reading progress bar arrives in the version 4.0 update alongside support for "independent settings" regarding titles, body text fonts, and supplementary fonts of reflowable documents.</p>
<h2 id="additional-boox-page-updates-2">Additional Boox Page Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="kQGvK4tHVLdfJMuauuTxqa" name="onyx-boox-page-version-4-patch-notes-start" alt="A photo of the changelog for version 4.0 for the Boox Page e-reader." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kQGvK4tHVLdfJMuauuTxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li>Optimized OCR function, OCR now works in the background while you read PDFs</li><li>Optimized word lookup experience, you can prioritize Word Lookup or Translation (Selection) in Neoreader > Settings > Dictionary Settings</li><li>Optimized display of Traditional/Japanese symbols</li><li>Adjusted the Refresh entry of Neoreader to the first-level bottom menu for easier refresh mode customization</li><li>Fixed some known issues and improved system stability</li></ul>
<p>The update has started rolling out, so users should be aware and check their device accordingly. Boox warns that the Page e-reader will go through a brief optimization period after the patch. This may lead to increased heat and power consumption; however those issues should subside after a couple of days.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Boox Page</a> is a pretty decent e-reader with a 7-inch E Ink display. Users are confined to its black and white screen, which makes doing anything else (watching videos or a light game) a little hard to deal with. The reading experience is made quite easy as the Page features dual page-turning buttons on the front. There's also the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Boox Note Air 3</a> with a 10.3-inch display that takes reading files, emails, and books to another level.</p>

<p>So what do Samsung phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> have? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Samsung Good Lock</a>. No, that's not me misspelling "good luck, Samsung." That's the name for Samsung's epic software and UI customization suite, which debuted in South Korea in 2016 and has since expanded in scope and presence worldwide.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">One UI 7 rolls out</a> to more Galaxy phones this month, users will find that Good Lock has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">completely redesigned</a> from the ground up for Samsung's latest Android release. The old, confusing UI elements are gone, replaced with a single list of all Good Lock modules that makes it far easier to find what you want.</p><p>Samsung is the only company that offers anything like Good Lock. Some companies offer several different UI customization elements — things like optional split notification shades or ways to tweak UI colors — but Samsung Good Lock lets you change, tweak, and even add massively helpful features and new functionality to the phone you already love.</p><p>It's the best reason to buy a Samsung phone, and Samsung only has a few more steps to take to make Good Lock a one-stop shop for phone customization.</p>

<h2 id="something-for-almost-everyone-2">Something for (almost) everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fqzNnL3N3pbAXo48sMCB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-02" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fqzNnL3N3pbAXo48sMCB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung Good Lock is the company's attempt to please everyone with options and settings that most other phones (including its own) don't offer. From the complete customization of the quick toggles and other UI elements, multiple multitasking UI choices, unique home screen customization, and even accessibility features not found elsewhere, Good Lock is hard to beat.</p><p>But it's also more challenging to find than it should be. Good Lock is still only available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock">on the Samsung Galaxy App Store</a> (for now). That means not only do customers need to know about Good Lock's existence beforehand, but they also need to understand that the Galaxy App Store is different from the Google Play Store.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">announced</a> that Good Lock would be coming to the Play Store with One UI 7, so it's only a matter of time as the update has just begun rolling out at the time of writing.</p><p>At the very least, Samsung should include the Good Lock launcher preinstalled on every Galaxy Phone, as it only takes up a paltry 34 MB of space as of One UI 7. This would make it much easier for users to customize their phones out of the box without having to research it and would give Samsung a wow factor that most people likely don't know exists.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung should include the Good Lock launcher on every Galaxy phone instead of requiring users to find it on the Galaxy App Store.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the improved UI in the One UI 7 release makes finding what you want in Good Lock easy. That's quite a change from the old style, which includes weird names like QuickStar, Nice Shot, MultiStar, RegiStar, and plenty more. Some of the names make a lot more sense — Camera Assistant and Routines+ are pretty self-explanatory — and I think it would do Samsung some good to rename the weird ones into something more basic.</p><p>The new UI now includes a row of UI chips up top. These little buttons help you find settings like wallpaper, notifications, keyboard, lock screen, and others. I'd love to see Samsung add a proper search to Good Lock so we can quickly find settings throughout the suite of modules Good Lock offers, as that would offer a complete solution to finding what you want.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Good Lock 3.0 is a huge upgrade over its predecessors, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly, I want to see some modules reach their full potential, particularly the newest one, Display Assistant. This new module was teased as giving users "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-labs-display-assistant-test">total display control</a>" but that's not actually true. The main feature revolves around giving users the ability to change the refresh rate per-app, so you can set some apps to 120Hz while others can be restricted to a lower rate to save battery.</p><p>And while Samsung gives you the option to force high brightness for longer — even if your phone starts to get very hot — it doesn't give users the option to disable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. Every phone from Motorola and OnePlus offers this option, while some phones from brands like Honor, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo also offer this, all without having to install an additional app to do it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-samsung-galaxy-phone-first-things">first thing I do when I get a Samsung Galaxy phone</a> is download Good Lock, then install the <strong>Home Up</strong> module. This module lets you customize not only your home screen but, most importantly for me, the multitasking UI. I absolutely <strong>abhor</strong> the stock Android multitasking UI and rank it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">among the absolute worst multitasking UIs</a> in existence. Samsung's default UI isn't much better, but Good Lock makes quick work of that.</p><p>I prefer to use the grid format UI for multitasking as it places six apps at my fingertips at all times. You can find this in the Task Changer section of the Home Up module in Good Lock, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Head to the Home Screen section of the Home Up module and turn on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">DIY Home Screen</a> for an experience customization junkies are sure to love.</p><p>Once you're done there, grab the <strong>QuickStar</strong> module and customize the quick toggles and notification area to your liking. I love a dense quick toggle pane as it gives me the option to quickly choose from 10-12 settings with a single tap, while the default offers just 8. It also lets you turn off some of those annoying status icons like NFC or VoLTE that don't do anything for anyone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The first thing I swap out is the multitasking UI, followed by customizing the notification shade and quick toggles.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Next, check out both the <strong>NotiStar</strong> and <strong>Nice Catch</strong> modules. NotiStar gives you an easy way to see your notification history so you can <em>finally</em> figure out what notification you accidentally swiped away. I don't know about you, but this scenario happens to me all the time and it drives me crazy, but NotiStar completely fixes the issue. Nice Catch gives you even more ways to dive into notification history, including toast notifications, phantom vibrations, and more.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>Camera Assistant</strong> can help people who have specific problems with Samsung cameras. Don't like Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">aggressive HDR algorithms</a>? Turn it off! Have issues with the software taking too long to actually take the picture after you press the shutter button? Enable quick tap shutter!</p><p>There are even options to adjust lens distortion correction, picture softening, auto lens switching, or even to prioritize focusing on a subject over capture speed. It's mostly a little something for everyone, even if it may not encompass <em>every</em> little nook and cranny.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-waiting-for-2">What are you waiting for?</h2>
<p>After nearly 10 years of Good Lock's existence, it's great to see Samsung's renewed interest in building out the feature to make it the ultimate customization suite. No other brand offers something like Good Lock, even if a handful of its features are included on some others phones without an additional download.</p><p>Samsung only has a few things it could do to improve the app, mainly revolving around surfacing the app itself as well as making it easier to find specific settings. Most Good Lock modules have been built out quite a bit, but the company could offer a few more options that would really seal the deal. More display accessibility options are an absolute must, while things like the ability to add labels on quick toggle icons would be nice.</p><p>If you've got a Samsung Galaxy phone and haven't tried Good Lock, what are you waiting for? It's the best reason to own a Samsung phone and a fantastic way to make the phone feel more like <em>your phone</em> rather than just another smartphone.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google introduced an AI-based Scam Detection feature for Pixel phones as part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">feature drop</a> last month. The popular feature is now being introduced to Pixel Watch models as well, the search giant announced.</p><p>In a recent Pixel Watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/336738887/scam-detection-is-now-available-on-pixel-watch-in-call?hl=en&sjid=14283440370990026999-NC">community post</a>, Google announced that it is rolling out this feature to Pixel Watch 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> models for the U.S. region. It promises users protection from scammers’ calls just by glancing at their wrist, provided they are connected to a Pixel 9 series phone and above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC" name="google-pixel-march-feature-drop-suspicious-texts" alt="Google is rolling out scam detection measures for texts and calls on the Pixel 9 and 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This Scam Detection feature identifies conversation patterns widely used by scammers, “right as they happen.” With the feature enabled, Pixel Watch owners will receive an alert mid-call of a scam, which will be received by the Bluetooth signal as the smartwatch will be paired with the aforementioned Pixel phones.</p><p>Setting up Scam Detection is also fairly simple as users need to be on the latest version of their Phone app to enable the feature. Opening the Phone app, navigating to its Settings, and turning on Scam Detection should make it up and running.</p>

<p>After enabling the feature, an audible beep can be heard at the start of the call, and it is an indication that the feature is currently ongoing in the background. Google further notes that if the scale of the scam call is high, users will be alerted with a notification, sound, and vibration, which can be dismissed or users can end the call right on their wrists.</p><p>Users have to bear in mind that the feature to work flawlessly on Pixel Watch Bluetooth connection is required, as mentioned. However, Scam Detection for direct calls over LTE on the watch itself is not supported. The feature has begun rolling out as noted is for the U.S. region starting this week, and it is in English language only, and it is unclear whether it expands to other regions anytime soon.</p>

<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta reportedly contains insight into a trio of updates inbound for its video and voice calling experience.</li><li>Video calls are seemingly preparing to receive a disable camera option before answering alongside emoji reactions.</li><li>Voice calls are being tested with a mute button that users can toggle before picking up a call.</li><li>WhatsApp recently dropped an AI update that lets users get more creative with their avatars and one that brings music to their statuses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has reportedly begun testing for a host of new call features that'll affect those using voice and video.</p><p>The development of the new features was spotted in a recent WhatsApp beta on Android by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-10-16-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, which detailed three major additions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/whatsapp-testing-new-call-features-mute-button-camera-toggle-emoji-reactions/">SammyGuru</a>). The beta starts with an upcoming feature for video calls that aims to add a layer of privacy for users. The APK dive spotted a "turn off your video" option during the video call acceptance screen.</p><p>The post states this will let WhatsApp users "handle unfamiliar contacts" more easily since their face won't be revealed outright when answering. Previously, users were required to answer a video call before the ability to disable their camera appeared. Additionally, WhatsApp was spotted working on "emoji reactions" for video calls, specifically. The beta shows six emojis available in the sub-menu with the share screen and send message options.</p><p>If all goes well, users should see a thumbs up, heart, laughing, shocked, tearful, and prayer emoji. What the beta doesn't tease is how these emojis will appear. WhatsApp could have them float up on the screen during the video call or appear in some other flashy fashion — but nothing concrete was shown.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:981px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.16%;"><img id="PyRb4uqLCwkzUP9ibGjEZN" name="whatsapp-video-voice-call-features-additions-spotted" alt="WhatsApp is working on a disable camera button for video calls before answering, emoji reactions, and a mute voice option when receiving voice calls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyRb4uqLCwkzUP9ibGjEZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="981" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final addition concerns standard voice calls, as WhatsApp is working on a mute button. The post states a mute button was located in the alert within Android's notification panel when receiving a call. A user could preemptively mute their microphone before answering the call.</p><p>WABetaInfo discovered these additions in v2.25.10.16 of the WhatsApp beta on Android quite recently. As of now, there's no telling when these updates could arrive for stable users.</p><p>That's not an issue, as WhatsApp users just started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-gains-upgraded-ai-avatars-adding-music-to-statuses">receiving an update</a> yesterday (Apr. 7), which brought AI avatars via the "imagine" prompt through Meta AI. Users can upload a selfie of themselves and tell the AI to imagine them with new hair or perhaps an entirely different outfit. What's more, the platform also rolled out the ability for users to add music to their shared status. Users will find a new music note icon before sharing that lets them search for song titles and artists.</p><p>On the other hand, WhatsApp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-chat-themes-and-new-backgrounds">debuted Chat Themes</a> for users looking to bring a little more pop to their chats. The platform offered a selection of default themes while also giving users a chance to make their own.</p>

<p>Given the current economic situation, it's no wonder that many folks are switching wireless carriers to save money on their phone bill. Fortunately, we're currently in the golden age of MVNOs, and there is no shortage of excellent wireless deals to check out today. Keep reading for a selection of my favorites from this month.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO</a> (mobile virtual network operator) is an alternative carrier that utilizes the vast networks of larger companies — such as Verizon, T-Mobile, or AT&T — so you get the same great coverage for cheap, without the hassle of a complicated contract or loads of hidden fees. Some of these companies might even sell you one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> at a serious discount. If you aren't totally sold on the prospect, it's also worth noting that many of the best MVNO carriers also offer free trials with zero hassle or commitment whatsoever. In other words, if you want to save some cash on your phone bill, there's almost no reason not to try an MVNO.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-switch-to-an-mvno-2">Should I switch to an MVNO?</h2>
<p>Most MVNOs provide the same great coverage as a mainstream carrier at a much lower cost, but of course, they aren't for everyone. Many companies will deprioritize you when the network becomes busy, and you may miss out on some international perks. In many cases, these alternative carriers are also digital-only, which means you won't get the convenience of a company with a local retail presence. </p><p>That said, if none of those things is a problem to you and you're sick of paying hundreds on your wireless bill every month, it might be time to switch!</p>

<p>So, you’re looking for an affordable phone that has premium features. It sounds like an impossible feat but it isn’t. There really are tons of great Android phones that don’t cost an arm and a leg but still rival some of the best phones out there when it comes to processing power, cameras, and even AI integration. Sure, you’ll make a few concessions whether it’s relating to materials, battery life, storage, or some other aspect. But for many users, these phones will do just fine.</p><p>Two models worth considering are the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Google Pixel 9a, both of which only recently just launched and thus are probably on your radar. Here, we’ll help you choose between them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-model-holding-cropped16-9" alt="A deep blue Moto G Stylus 5G 2025 in the hands of a model with a city backdrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just launched in April 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a> comes in funky Pantone colors like Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web and boasts a leather-inspired finish. Equipped with a 6.7-inch pOLED Super HD AMOLED screen with 2,712 x 1,220 resolution and adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, you’ll get up to 3,000 nits brightness for comfortable viewing even in bright sunlight.</p><p>The ultra-thin and lightweight phone has a 5,000 mAh battery that can last for 40+ hours: that’s almost two full days! When you need to recharge, it supports both 68W TurboPower wired charging (with an optional adapter) and 15W wireless charging. With a 68W charger, you can get another full day of use after just a 15-minute charge, so it’s worth the investment to get one.</p><p>The phone is durable, too, meeting IP68 certification for water- and dust-resistance, along with MIL-STD-810H standards. A nice inclusion is that it comes with a built-in stylus, which makes things like taking notes, navigating webpages, sketching, and even using AI features seamlessly. The stylus boasts improved responsiveness as well, compared to last year’s model.</p><p>Choose either 128GB or 256GB storage but you’re locked there unless you use the cloud as there’s no memory card slot for adding more on-board. The 5G phone has dual SIMs, NFC, GPS, and Bluetooth 5.4 along with dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and two mics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-on-grass" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a laying back-up on a mossy surface next to a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Google Pixel 9a, also arriving in early April, compare? It’s pretty similar. It comes in Iris, Peony, Porcelain, or Obsidian with a composite matte back and satin metal finish. The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Actua OLED screen is smaller at 6.3 inches boasting a lesser 2,424 x 1,080 resolution, 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits brightness. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Michael L. Hicks says in his early hands-on</a> that it’s the first hard-edges, no-camera-bar Pixel he has seen to date. There’s no camera bar, however, a design choice to make room for a larger battery. Indeed, he admits it’s very rare to see a battery this large in a phone so thin, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>Also thin and lightweight, though it’s a smidge lighter, the Google Pixel 9a has a 5,100mAh battery, the largest yet for a Pixel phone, along with a larger vapor chamber for keeping it cool while multitasking or especially gaming. You’ll get an impressive 30+ hours of use per charge, but you can extend this to up to 100 hours, or just over four days, using Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports both fast and wireless charging as well, but at a much slower rate of 23W and 7.5W, respectively.</p><p>There’s no stylus with this phone, but it does offer the same IP68 rating along with a fingerprint-resistant design. It, too, comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage, which is non-expandable.</p><p>As a 5G phone as well, you’ll get the same NFC, GPS, dual SIM, and stereo speakers with a pair of mics (no Dolby Atmos support), and it offers Bluetooth 5.3 instead. There are some useful inclusions with this phone, however, so you can get more from it out of the box. This includes a three-month subscription to Google One for additional cloud storage, three months of access to YouTube Premium, and six months of Fitbit Premium, ideal to use alongside an accessory like the Google Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="WDSd35TFNTjnorKUaZhtA4" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-option-table-cropped-16-9" alt="A deep blue Motorola G Stylus 5G 2025 with its stylus beside it on a white table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDSd35TFNTjnorKUaZhtA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, it’s time to get busy with these two phones. What can they do?</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes out of the box with Android 15 and comes with two OS updates and three years of bi-monthly security patches. So it will last you for some time, but not as long as the Google Pixel 9a.</p><p>Running on a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, you’ll get 8GB RAM with the RAM Boost feature that can use reserve storage as RAM. Historically, however, we have found this feature to be finicky and typically not worth leveraging.</p><p>You’ll find Google’s AI features and Moto AI processing, mainly for use with the camera. Thanks to the included stylus, this phone is great for both productivity and creativity. There’s nothing particularly groundbreaking about this phone, but it has all the usuals you’d expect in a Moto device like Moto Secure, Family Space, and Moto Unplugged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>The Google Pixel 9a is an AI user’s dream thanks to deep integration with Google Gemini, which you’ll find in the entire Pixel 9 series as well as older models. Google also supports this phone with a whopping seven years of OS and security updates along with frequent Pixel Drops, so you’ll get a lot bang for your buck. It comes out of the box with the latest Android 15 OS.</p><p>The Google Tensor G4 processor affords a smooth experience alongside Titan M2 security, though benchmarks have historically shown that it falls short of Snapdragon-powered phones. It has the same 8GB RAM and adds useful features Pixel owners have come to love, like Pixel Call Assist, Clear Calling, Call Screen, and Hold for Me.</p><p>There are also useful safety features like car crash detection that will call emergency services for you, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, VPN by Google, and the option to auto-lock the device should it be lost or stolen. There’s also built-in anti-malware and anti-phishing features, so you can be assured that you’re getting an iron-clad experience.</p><p>The big differentiator here is that Google has built Gemini right into the phone, so you get access to the AI assistant to help with just about any task, question, or activity you’re performing.</p>

<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the cameras. The Moto G Stylus 2025 has a 50MP main camera with a Sony LYTIA 700C sensor and OIS complemented by a 13MP rear ultra-wide camera with macro vision and a 32MP front camera. There’s also a 3-in-1 light sensor in the rear camera. It can also shoot 4K videos with features like slow motion.</p><p>There are tons of camera features, like ultra-res, portrait, pro, 360° panorama, night vision, RAW, HDR, tilt-shift, and even a scan option, powered by Adobe Scan. Leveraging Moto AI processing, you can also enjoy features like auto smile capture, Google Lens, and more.</p><p>The stylus has a neat feature called Sketch to Image whereby you can use AI to bring your drawings to life in Moto Note. Additionally, AI is used through the photo enhancement engine, which analyzes frames to help preserve details and yield the best possible results. Google Photos AI, meanwhile, further helps you fine-tune your images. You can also leverage the stylus to use features like Google’s Circle to Search, which is available on this phone, too.</p><p>We haven’t yet had the chance to try the cameras but can bring more insights soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-close-up" alt="A close-up of the new camera module on the Google Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9a has a 48MP wide main camera, 13MP ultra-wide, and 13MP front camera, so you might not get selfies that are as good. The real magic comes with Google's incredible photo editing features.</p><p>Along with night sight, macro focus, and long exposure, you can play around with features like Add Me, which allows the photographer to add themselves to a group shot after the fact; Best Take, Face Unblur, and Magic Editor for removing distracting elements from a photo, repositioning subjects, and more. There are also features like Super Res Zoom.</p><p>We’re reviewing this phone right now, so stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>It’s a truly tough decision between the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Google Pixel 9a. Both are new phones and affordable options in the line. They boast similar specs with some minor differences. The Moto G Stylus 2025 is cheaper, but you’re missing out on the deep Google AI integration.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 is the bigger phone with the included stylus that’s a no-brainer for those who love to use one (though you could buy one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">the best stylus</a> separately to use with the Google Pixel 9a if you really wanted to). Both phones are equally durable and both offer fantastic battery life.</p><p>Based on specs alone, the Moto G Stylus 2025 has better cameras, but the Google Pixel 9a can’t be beat when it comes to photo editing and being able to correct otherwise throwaway shots or capturing images you might not otherwise be able to get (like a group shot without having to ask a passer-by to take it).</p><p>Historically, Google Pixel phones are reliable and excel in virtually every department, and the Google Pixel 9a is no exception. It’s not a massive step down from the more expensive Google Pixel 9, which offers faster charging, improved cameras, and more RAM. Considering the price, that’s a pretty enticing value proposition.</p><p>Because of this heavy integration with AI, all the add-ons you get, and the lengthy support of seven years, we’d go with the Google Pixel 9a over the Moto G Stylus 2025. But, if you want the stylus, you love Moto phones, need a bigger screen, and want to enjoy ultra-fast recharging, the Moto G Stylus 2025 isn’t a bad choice by any means.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus series from Motorola has been our go-to recommendation if you need an Android phone with a bundled stylus. It's not on the same level as a Galaxy S25 Ultra but you're also paying less than half the price. 2024's Moto G Sylus 5G was a fantastic offering for the price, and Motorola has made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">the 2025 model</a> even better for the exact same $399 price tag.</p><p>If you're trying to decide between the Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, we've got you covered. The new model does come with a host of improvements that makes a good phone even better, and offers stiff competition to something like the Samsung Galaxy A36 at the same price. But with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">2024 Moto G Stylus</a> retailing for a lot less, that could still be a good alternative if you're looking to save big. Let's compare both and see which is best for you.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbAsngyouuToAza7PW3Kyf" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-15.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbAsngyouuToAza7PW3Kyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4185" height="2354" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Moto G Stylus 2025 retains the same vegan-leather back panel that we all love. The design closely resembles what we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, making the new Stylus look nearly identical to them with the four cutouts in the camera island. The colors are one way of telling them apart as the 2025 Moto G Stylus comes in Pantone Gibraltar Sea and Pantone Surf the Web, both different shades of blue. This might be disappointing to some since the 2024 Moto G Stylus came in Caramel Latte and Scarlet Wave shades.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 has the same 6.7-inch display size as the older model, but this pOLED panel now sports a higher 3,000 nits of brightness. It's a full-HD resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate, which checks all the boxes.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has nearly the same dimensions and weight as the new phone, so it won't feel much different. The vegan leather back offers good grip and gives it a classy look. In fact, we thought it looked way more premium than its asking price, and that's always a good thing. We found the display to be fantastic too with good legibility outdoors, despite the peak brightness of 1,200 nits. It too is a pOLED panel with a full-HD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj" name="motorola-g-stylus-5g-2025-deep-blue-model-holding-cropped16-9" alt="A deep blue Moto G Stylus 5G 2025 in the hands of a model with a city backdrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9fdXF9xNJZbbuxhXqF7oj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes with 8GB RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 SoC, which on paper, should be slightly faster than the Gen 1 chip in the 2024 model. NFC is present and you get wide 5G compatibility with all the major U.S. carriers. Performance of the new Moto G Stylus should be similar to what we experienced with the 2024 model, which is to say, quite good.</p><p>The phone has the same battery capacity as the older one, but charging is way quicker. The Moto G Stylus 2025 features a 5,000mAh battery with 68W TurboPower fast charging and 15W wireless charging. The only catch is that the wired charger needs to be bought separately. The Type-C port is still the USB 2.0 standard but the wireless connectivity has been upgraded to Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>The camera sensor sizes of both phones are the same, but the 2025 Moto G Stylus uses a Sony LYTIA 700C 50MP sensor which should deliver better low-light images. The secondary camera is a 13MP ultrawide with macro capabilities. The third cutout on the back is actually a 3-in-1 light sensor for more accurate light metering in photos. You get a 32MP camera in the front. The phone can record up to 4K 30fps videos with the front and rear main cameras.</p>

<p>The 2024 Moto G Stylus launched at $399 on May 9, 2024, and the Moto G Stylus 5G costs exactly the same at launch. You can now find the 2024 model for as low as $250 on places like Amazon. This makes it incredibly good value since you're getting some premium features at bargain prices.</p><p>We found the performance to be more than adequate too thanks to the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC and 8GB of RAM. There's 128GB or 256GB of storage, depending on which region you buy it from. This storage is also expandable, which is a rare sight these days.</p><p>We found the battery life to be excellent as well. The 5,000mAh capacity didn't give us the two-day run we expected, but it's good enough to last at least one full day with heavy use. Charging speed is decently quick at 30W, and you get 15W wireless charging too.</p><p>The cameras on the Moto G Stylus 2024 really surprised us as we weren't expecting a whole lot. The sensor resolution of all the cameras is the same as the 2025 model, and so are most of the capabilities.</p>

<p>The software experience should be nearly identical on both phones. The 2024 Moto G Stylus shipped with Android 14 along with Motorola's Hello UX customizations. You have acces to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app </a>and other smart features like AI wallpaper. There's only one OS upgrade planned for this phone though so it won't go beyond Android 15.</p><p>The 2025 Moto G Stylus ships with Android 15, and Motorola has pledged two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates. Our one big gripe with the 2024 model was the annoying Glance lockscreen program, which we hope has been done away with on the new iteration.</p><p>The built-in stylus is one of the main draws for this phone, and it works well. We're yet to test it on the 2025 model but it doesn't seem like Motorola has given it any major upgrades. It's a handy tool to have for quickly taking notes, annotating on screenshots, doing digital signatures, sketching, and so on.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 is easily the better phone compared to the 2024 model. The display is brighter, it chargers faster, it has better ingress protection and durability ratings, it supports newer wireless standards, and the main camera should perform a notch better.</p><p>At $400 though, there's also the Samsung Galaxy A36 to consider which has roughly the same specs but with six years (vs. two) of OS upgrades, and a more premium glass back design.</p><p>If you're not too fussed about the upgraded features in the 2025 Moto G Stylus, the 2024 model is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentrahttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phonesl.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> at nearly $250. But it only supports up to Android 15, and then you won't get any more OS updates. This, plus the significant bump in durability, are solid reasons why the Moto G Stylus 2025 is worth upgrading to.</p>

<ul><li>All Pixel Watch models seem to be receiving BP1A.250305.019.W7 build firmware as part of the new April Wear OS update.</li><li>While the changelog from Google is yet to go live, the update appears to be addressing issues such as delayed notifications and battery-draining problems that arose from the March update.</li><li>While it is an April update, it is believed to be still incorporating the March security patch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is releasing fresh updates for its Pixel Watch models, which seem to be the monthly update that focuses mostly on bug fixes while maintaining the security patch from March.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/pixel-watch-april-2025-update/">9to5Google</a>, the search giant has started rolling out this year's April update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> alongside the older Pixel Watch 2 and the original Pixel Watch. It is believed to be based on the Wear OS 5.1 update, which was rolled out last month. The Android 15-based update bearing <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W7</strong> has started appearing on the aforementioned Pixel Watch models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication also points out that, unlike last month's updates, which divided the build numbers among smartwatches — with the latest one, all Pixel Watch models are said to be now running the same builds. While the changelog of the April update is yet to go live on Google's community page, the firmware for the above-mentioned Pixel Watch models is already live on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota-watch">Google Developers site</a>.</p><p>9to5 further notes that the update is primarily focused on bug fixes and users would still be staying on the March security patch. These bug fixes are likely to address the delayed notifications issue and battery draining problems, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">surfaced from the March update</a>, and the company promised to roll out a fix soon. We should be knowing more of the firmware when Google releases the full changelog this week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch, Watch 2, and Watch 3 owners can either download and manually install the firmware or head over to the smartwatch's <em><strong>Settings> System> System Updates </strong></em>and wait for the OTA update to arrive.</p><p>On the other hand, after releasing monthly minor updates over the years, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">announced</a> that it would be bringing substantial quarterly updates from now on and it started with the Wear OS 5.1 update in March and the next one is likely geared up for this June.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's next-gen phone to encourage productivity and creativity is finally arriving for U.S.-based consumers.</p><p>The Motorola G Stylus (2025) was announced in a press release early today (Apr. 8) with an enhanced stylus experience and a "striking" design. Leading off the launch is a 6.7-inch Super HD pOLED screen with a max 120Hz refresh rate. Motorola highlights the 2025 G Stylus display's 3,000nits of brightness, which it claims will keep its visuals high even in bright scenarios.</p><p>Keeping your G Stylus strong and durable is the military standard MIL-STD-810H rating, as well as IP68 water protection. Motorola states its focus on improving the phone's durability should help shield it from falls (~1.5 meters) and from being submerged in water (~1.5 meters up to 30 mins).</p><p>The back of the G Stylus 2025 features a premium leather finish around its camera array. This square housing consists of a 50MP Sony Lytia 700C sensor with OIS, a 13MP ultrawide lens (with macro lens integration), and a 3-in-1 light sensor. Motorola highlights its camera support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, which delivers the "Photo Enhancement Engine."</p><p>The post states this feature works "automatically" to blend exposures and "preserve" your photo's rich colors and fine details. Additionally, the G Stylus 2025 contains AI features in Google Photos, which the company states may come in handy.</p>

<p>As it says in the name, the stylus that Motorola's next-gen phone comes with has been outfitted with improvements to pair well with Sketch to Image and Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. The company says users can opt to use the provided stylus to circle, highlight, or "tap text or images" to utilize Circle to Search's capabilities. Regarding Sketch to Image, potential G Stylus 2025 users can leverage the pen and Moto Note to put a new spin on their handmade doodles.</p><p>Elsewhere, the stylus' upgrades include a 6.4x boost in responsiveness when compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">the 2024 model</a>.</p><p>Empowering your daily tasks on the G Stylus is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 SoC. Additionally, users will find a 5,000mAh battery that will supposedly deliver roughly 40 hours of use on a single charge. Of course, its true usage times may vary depending on use, so be aware. The battery is paired with a 68W wired TurboPower charger and 15W wireless charging. Its wired charging method is said to give users "enough power for the day" on just a 15-minute charge cycle.</p><p>Other specs include Android 15, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. Motorola expresses its inclusion of Moto Secure and ThinkShield to help protect users. The device has also been granted 2 major OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates.</p>

I recently tested its sub-brand LaCie's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-pro5-ssd-thunderbolt-5-fastest-ssd-ive-ever-used"> Thunderbolt 5-enabled rugged SSD</a> and came away thinking my high-end gaming machine (with an RTX 5090) is the bottleneck in realizing the drive's true potential, and the One Touch SSDs are a great alternative if you don't need Thunderbolt storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2672px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.85%;"><img id="fPHUFwWJx3fxcXNfRCqJM5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPHUFwWJx3fxcXNfRCqJM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2672" height="1145" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seagate's latest product is just as interesting, if targeted at a niche. The brand partnered with MiHoYo to launch the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD, and it looks incredible. I'm liking the sudden influx of accessories based on the game — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-genshin-impact-charging-accessories">UGREEN sent me a massive Genshin Impact package</a> containing uniquely-styled power banks and chargers — and Seagate's SSD combines a great visual aesthetic with 24/7 reliability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gub3KPwDqBW3A3JxXGiYK5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gub3KPwDqBW3A3JxXGiYK5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seagate is using Cyno as the inspiration, and the etched design clearly differentiates the SSD. The vivid purple color scheme is fabulous, and the side along with the back have etched runic patterns that add to its overall flamboyance. While most external SSDs look quite good in their own right, the Genshin Impact drive is definitely in a league of its own when it comes to the design, and I don't believe I've used a drive that stands out quite as much.</p>

<p>The SSD connects via USB-C 3.2, and there's a tiny LED indicator that lights up when it's active. Adding to the vibrancy of the drive is a purple LED light bar on the other end, and I appreciate the attention to detail Seagate lavished on the SSD. I used dozens of gaming-themed accessories in the past that amounted to nothing more than a logo or a decal, but Seagate put in the work to customize the SSD extensively.</p>

<p>The drive is a little wider than most external SSDs, but it's still easily portable, and at 65g, it doesn't make any noticeable difference in your bag. Seagate bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and while it is on the shorter side, there are no issues when connecting the drive to phones, tablets, and handhelds like the Steam Deck.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="W2kigpMCZxQE6MtwEJAfN5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2kigpMCZxQE6MtwEJAfN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the SSD to move data to and from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and it did a rock-solid job with data transfers. The only quibble is that the bundled cable was too short to connect to my gaming machine, so I used a USB 4 cable instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BR8WC9mbXZvtn42xdQmJL5" name="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD" alt="Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BR8WC9mbXZvtn42xdQmJL5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, I didn't see any problems moving over data from Windows. The drive uses exFAT out of the box to ensure it can be used with the widest range of devices, but you can easily format it should you wish to switch to NTFS. The drive is just as fast as other external SSDs I tested, going up to 980MB/s with reads and 300MB/s writes.</p>

<p>Although most external SSDs I use have 4TB of storage, Seagate is selling the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD in a single 1TB variant. It's still decent enough storage for most users, but if you're looking at this as an external SSD to store games, there isn't much in the way of headroom — a 2TB option would have been ideal.</p>

<p>Overall, Seagate did a magnificent job with the Genshin Impact Limited Edition External SSD, and the only real limitation with the drive has to do with availability. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/?sku=STMU1000402">sold exclusively on Seagate's U.S. website</a>, and at $139, it has a sizeable premium — the 1TB variant of the One Touch SSD can be bought for as low as $84. But if you're a Genshin Impact fan and want an SSD that stands out, this is obviously the one to get. Seagate says it will only sell the drive until quantities last, so if you like the look of this SSD, you'll need to act now.</p>

<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 users are in for a unique set of AI capabilities. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introduces-real-time-visual-ai-galaxy-s25-series-gemini-live-update/?utm_source=pr_media&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general">announced</a> in a press release that starting today (April 7) that through a new software update, the Galaxy S25 series will be able to have real-time visual conversations on their phones with Gemini Live.</p><p>Users will now be able to trigger Gemini Live with just a click of a button and have a full blown interactive video conversation with it. To summon the AI assistant, "Just press and hold the side button to show Gemini Live what you see while simultaneously interacting with it in a live conversation."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q6fHRLDQ9WnHw8QUnK6U6Z" name="Samsung-Galaxy-s25-Gemini-live" alt="Samsung Introduces Real-Time Visual AI on Galaxy S25 Series With Gemini Live Update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q6fHRLDQ9WnHw8QUnK6U6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is specifically useful for when you need help picking out an outfit for a date night or reorganizing a closet based on Mary Kondo's method. Gemini Live could be your stylist without you needing to spend the money on hiring one. And here's how its done, "simply point the camera to the object and users can get suggestions on how to categorize items and optimize space, or share their screen while browsing online retailers to receive personalized style advice."</p><p>With this ability, your phone becomes more of your sidekick when your bestie isn't answering the call. This will create a whole new outlook for how we use AI in this day and age."With this new visual capability, the Galaxy S25 series brings next-generation AI experiences to life, setting new standards for how users engage with the world through their devices,” said  Jay Kim, executive vice president in the presser.</p>

<p>This ability will start rolling out to Galaxy S25 series users at no additional cost through a software update. However, Android Central folks who own one of these devices are yet to see an update on their end, hinting that this could be rolling out in phases.</p><p>Google has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series">rolled out</a> this feature to the Pixel series 9. Gemini Live's new video streaming and screen-sharing features are now reaching all users with the latest flagship phones.</p><p>In other news, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">has finally started rolling out </a>its most awaited software update, the One UI 7 to some users in Korea. The first ones to get this update patch are Galaxy S24, Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6 users who were using beta and non-beta versions of the Android 15 operating system. This 5.2GB update comes with new features, improvements, and Galaxy AI tricks that everyone has been waiting for. As for the people in the U.S., they will start seeing an update rollout on April 10, according to the company's announcement.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few years, I've written about how Chromebooks are the perfect devices for Arm processors. No, I'm not talking about the ones that we already have, I'm talking about the ones that are found in a lot of fantastic Windows laptops. Which includes Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">Snapdragon X Elite</a>, which debuted in late 2023.</p><p>I was hopeful that, <em>eventually,</em> Chromebook makers would get around to at least offering <em>something</em> with a flagship Arm SoC; as it turns out, we are, just not from Qualcomm. Instead, MediaTek is swooping in with its recent announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced" target="_blank">Kompanio Ultra</a>, designed specifically "for the next generation of Chromebook Plus devices."</p><p>There are a couple of big selling points for processors using this architecture, as opposed to x86. Having a Chromebook that is both powerful and battery-efficient is pretty much the dream. As it currently stands, you can pick one or the other, but very few of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> manage to achieve both.</p>
<h2 id="what-matters-most-2">What matters most</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB" name="android-tablet-ui-on-surface-pro-11" alt="Android tablet UI on Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5013" height="2820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Arm-powered laptops are usually lighter and more compact, making them perfect for students. This is partially why Lenovo's Chromebook Duet line remains a fan favorite. It's compact and powerful (enough) while also being pretty affordable compared to other tablets and laptops.</p><p>While I love the Duet, especially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Duet 11</a>, it still doesn't scratch the itch for me in the same way that my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a> does. To be clear, these are not competitors in anything other than form factor, as the Surface starts at $999 for the base model Snapdragon X Plus or $1,499 for the X Elite. Meanwhile, the Duet 11 retails for $399 in its base configuration, which happens to include a keyboard folio cover and a stylus, two things you'll have to pay extra for with the Surface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.20%;"><img id="PBT65PjvTomAXKKZrkDTYk" name="mediatek-kompanio-ultra-infographic" alt="The MediaTek Kompanio Ultra delivers the 50 TOPS NPU for quicker generative AI processes on Chromebooks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBT65PjvTomAXKKZrkDTYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1587" height="876" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That being said, when introducing the Kompanio Ultra, MediaTek hit all of the important talking points for someone who wants a powerful and efficient device. Battery life is rated for up to 20 hours on a single charge, thanks in part to it consuming up to "50% less power vs. competition."</p><p>The Ultra even supports LPDDR5X memory, is built on a 3nm process, and features an "all-big-core CPU structure." As a result, MediaTek claims the Ultra will provide "up to 18% faster CPU performance" while making it possible to play the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> at a stable 60fps. Oh, and for you AI enthusiasts, the Ultra's NPU 890 has you covered with its 50 TOPS NPU for "greater on-device generative AI processes."</p>
<h2 id="chromebook-plus-expansion-2">Chromebook Plus expansion</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o4zf8xncr7Eii4ZVaJ3BmZ" name="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 with lid closed" alt="Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 with lid closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o4zf8xncr7Eii4ZVaJ3BmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, it seems that MediaTek absolutely nailed it, and now we just have to wait for new Chromebooks to arrive. This leads me to something that's arguably just as important as getting flagship Arm chips, and that's an expansion to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Chromebook Plus</a> requirements.</p><p>This part of the announcement kind of flew under the radar and wasn't even something that I immediately noticed when going through the press materials. Until now, Chromebook Plus models have been required to rely on either an Intel Core i3 12th Gen or higher or an AMD Ryzen 3 5000 series or higher.</p><p>Which has left some very good options from receiving the Chromebook Plus branding on the lid. This includes the Chromebook Duet 11, which technically meets all of Google's requirements except for the Kompanio 838 processor. As such, the Duet 11 is <em>just</em> a Chromebook and not a "Plus."</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-refresh-2">Time for a refresh</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="PBrVPSGcUJo6SGJDDWgCK9" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review-3.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBrVPSGcUJo6SGJDDWgCK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is huge, as it could spawn a wave of new and exciting Chromebooks, all powered by MediaTek. I don't want to put the cart before the horse just yet, but so far, things are looking promising. I just still can't help but wonder why Qualcomm stood by and did nothing, only to let MediaTek reap the rewards.</p><p>Funnily enough, maybe the here existence of this article will result in Qualcomm announcing a new chip for Chromebooks in the coming weeks. Hey, apparently, it worked after I wrote about whether we were witnessing a slow death for Chromebooks, so it could work for Qualcomm, too, right?</p>

<hr>
<p>Meta is kicking off its multimodal Llama 4 series with two fresh models: the lean-and-mean Scout and the powerhouse Maverick. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/" target="_blank">says</a> these new models are beating the competition pretty much across the board in early tests.</p><p>Maverick is the series' all-around workhorse, built to handle both text and visuals and is ideal for things like smart assistants and chat interfaces. On the flip side, Scout is the lighter, sharper one. It’s the one you want when you’re knee-deep in documents, untangling complex requests, or piecing together logic in massive codebases.</p><p>Llama 4 Scout and Maverick are now up for grabs on Llama.com and through Meta’s partners, including Hugging Face. Meta is also baking the new models into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI</a> assistant, which is already rolling out across apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, Messenger, and Instagram in 40 countries. That said, the multimodal features are U.S.-only and English-only for the time being.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mcZuz4FUtYqRxDw9mDJpPB" name="Llama-4-series" alt="Llama 4 series models comparative chart" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mcZuz4FUtYqRxDw9mDJpPB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="moe-power-2">MoE power</h2>
<p>Meta says Llama 4 is a big step forward under the hood. It’s the company's first time using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) setup. This makes things run smoother and faster, both when training the model and answering your questions. Basically, MoE works by breaking down heavy tasks into smaller chunks and handing them off to specialized mini-networks.</p><p>Scout packs 17 billion active parameters spread across 16 expert modules. According to Meta's specs, this setup outperforms Google’s Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and the open-source Mistral 3.1 on a bunch of common benchmarks, while keeping a lean profile that lets it run smoothly on just one Nvidia H100 GPU.</p><p>Scout shines when it comes to tasks like squeezing down huge amounts of text and making logical calls within big codebases. One standout feature is its massive context window, handling up to 10 million tokens. This means Scout can handle both text and visual data on a massive scale.</p>
<h2 id="maverick-s-strength-2">Maverick’s strength</h2>
<p>Meta gives Maverick the same accolade, saying it stacks up well against OpenAI’s GPT-4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-stable-version-of-gemini-2-0-flash-is-rolling-out-now-in-the-gemini-app">Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash</a>. What’s impressive is that it delivers similar results to DeepSeek-V3 for coding and logic, but with fewer than half the active parameters.</p><p>Maverick has 17 billion parameters spread across 128 expert networks. That said, Maverick doesn’t quite match up to Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 when it comes to top-tier performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.31%;"><img id="82GbRzU79w98x2MzqKbEfC" name="Llama-4-Maverick-benchmarks" alt="Llama 4 Maverick benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/82GbRzU79w98x2MzqKbEfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1638" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta has also teased the Llama 4 Behemoth, which is still in training. When it’s ready, the company expects it to be one of the smartest LLMs out there.</p><p>Behemoth packs 288 billion active parameters across 16 experts, with a total parameter count nearing two trillion. Early tests show Behemoth outshines GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Pro in STEM tasks, especially when it comes to solving math problems. However, it still hasn’t surpassed Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> in overall performance.</p><p>Essentially, everything in Meta’s apps that taps into AI is getting smarter, thanks to more advanced logic in the system. This means you’ll see sharper responses, better image generation, and ads that hit closer to the mark.</p>

I've always enjoyed using the Apple Watch for the consistency, but the ScanWatch Nova has a much better design, and I like the hybrid nature; it isn't a full-fledged smartwatch, so it lasts well over two weeks on average. <br><br>Honor's latest wearable — the Watch 5 Ultra — aims to strike a good balance in this regard. It is a smartwatch similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and other options in this category, but it misses out on Wear OS 5; Honor is instead using a lightweight variant of its Magic OS skin. While this means you don't get the ability to install any apps outside of those bundled with the watch, the upside is battery life — the Watch 5 Ultra easily lasts up to two weeks between charges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uviVgJKy5XbvPEyZb22XMU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Wearing the Honor Watch 5 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uviVgJKy5XbvPEyZb22XMU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ultra moniker is misleading here, as the Watch 5 Ultra doesn't quite have the same level of software polish or allure as the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. That said, it is much more affordable, coming in at €279 ($306) once it goes on sale in the coming weeks. The biggest downside to the watch is the lack of Wear OS, but Honor did a decent enough job with the bundled utilities, and it gets a lot right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pfJbY2JgwUnEaWh5WmDTGU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra rotating crown with a colorful background in the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfJbY2JgwUnEaWh5WmDTGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the smartwatch is the design; Honor really outdid itself in this area, and the Watch 5 Ultra clearly looks the part of a high-end smartwatch. The case itself is made out of a titanium alloy, and the octagonal design gives it an added flair — it stands out quite a bit from the usual sea of Android smartwatches. The use of a titanium alloy means it isn't quite as heavy while still offering excellent durability, and I have zero issues on the design side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PfxpP4jzNiBhqphw9ziQGU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra default band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfxpP4jzNiBhqphw9ziQGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor sells the smartwatch with a fluoroelastomer band as standard, and it has a good range of adjustability. The band is comfortable to wear, and doesn't add too much weight overall, and if you need to, you can easily switch it out — the smartwatch uses standard 22mm lugs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="czCouA6NuirWGveD6GP5FU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Wearing the Honor Watch 5 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/czCouA6NuirWGveD6GP5FU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The angular design of the Watch 5 Ultra contrasts well with the button on the right that doubles as the rotating crown, and the red accent distinguishes the otherwise understated design a little. The crown makes it easy to interact with the interface, and there's a second button on the right that is configurable; it launches workouts by default.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fhv9x6qeQmitjfLamBZw9U" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhv9x6qeQmitjfLamBZw9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining characteristic of the smartwatch is the massive 46mm size; it adds to its presence in a considerable way, and makes it look considerably bigger than its rivals. That said, the upside is that you have a sizeable 1.5-inch AMOLED panel that goes up to 60Hz, and it gets bright in outdoor use. What's notable is the use of LTPO tech to deliver better battery life, and this definitely makes a difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UmtCKYSbDcSUrnVQsbB7JU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UmtCKYSbDcSUrnVQsbB7JU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had no issues whatsoever while using the watch outdoors, and while the customizability isn't quite as extensive as what you get with Wear OS — you can't install custom faces — the selection included out of the box is exhaustive, so I didn't feel like I was missing out in this area. The bezels are relatively thin as well, and this also goes a long way in creating that upmarket look.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JuEiAi9zeprrNLXFRhi9JU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra next to Withings ScanWatch Nova" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JuEiAi9zeprrNLXFRhi9JU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the watch is huge, it isn't particularly heavy at 51g — the ScanWatch Nova is heavier — but you still get a good heft. There's just a single sizing option, and you miss out on cellular connectivity as well. That said, if you want a bigger smartwatch with a differentiated design, the Watch 5 Ultra ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<p>But it's the software where the Watch 5 Ultra runs into severe limitations. Honor did a good job with the lightweight interface, and it has good fluidity, but it is pretty basic, and you can't get the likes of Spotify or Uber on the smartwatch. That said, there are no issues with the basics; the Watch 5 Ultra did a great job mirroring notifications to my wrist, and the built-in speaker is quite good — you can make calls and even listen to music locally. Honor Health has a decent interface too, and it's easy to tweak settings via your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ENhyAR9LcUYQdZ5XQMUNDU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra next to Xiaomi 15 Ultra with Honor Health running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ENhyAR9LcUYQdZ5XQMUNDU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The watch does a good job with activity monitoring as well; it has over 100 exercises, and delivers useful insights like VO2Max while running. In a similar vein, it tracks heart rate, blood oxygen and stress levels, and the data is pretty consistent. I didn't really see any issues with the accuracy of the activity or health monitoring, and while I didn't use the feature, the smartwatch can be used when diving up to 40m.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="McT5uUp8bUHb55fBYFZuAU" name="Honor Watch 5 Ultra" alt="Honor Watch 5 Ultra's settings page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/McT5uUp8bUHb55fBYFZuAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the software is pretty basic, the battery life is anything but — the Watch 5 Ultra easily managed to last over two weeks without any issues. With the always-on mode enabled alongside continuous heart rate monitoring, I got a week's worth of use, which is a terrific showing. The best part is that you can use any Qi charging mat to charge the smartwatch; Honor bundles a custom charger, but it has standard Qi as well, and this makes it highly convenient on the go.</p>

<p>Overall, the Watch 5 Ultra definitely has a lot going for it. The styling combined with the titanium-backed chassis allows it to stand out, and the 1.5-inch AMOLED panel is one of the best you'll see in this category. It does a great job with activity and health monitoring, and while you don't get all the software extras, the battery life is a major bonus over other Android smartwatches. It is on the costlier side when you consider the feature-set, but if you want a bigger smartwatch that excels at the basics, the Watch 5 Ultra has you covered.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced today that it will be integrating Gemini's multimodal capabilities into AI Mode on Google Search.</li><li>This will help expand Search's capabilities by answering comprehensive questions in one go.</li><li>Google Search's AI Mode becomes available to more "Labs" users in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-multimodal-search/">announced</a> today that it will give<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI Mode</a> on Google Search more powers to perform its tasks. In a press release the company said that it is expanding its Gemini Capabilities to AI Mode on Google search, with the help of Google Lens.</p><p>"This experience brings together powerful visual search capabilities in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens </a>with a custom version of Gemini, so you can easily ask complex questions about what you see," Google stated.</p><p>It allows users who have access to AI Mode to be able to snap a photo or record a video and ask the chatbot a comprehensive question about what they see. For instance, users can ask exploratory and open-ended questions in AI mode, along with more complicated tasks — "like comparing two products, exploring how-tos or planning a trip," the Keyword added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF" name="AI-Mode-Google-Search-Lens" alt="AI-mode-multimodal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXBH2Hn49YAQcsTHszYWxF.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Mode gets this ability from Gemini’s multimodal capabilities. The tech giant added that once this mode is enabled, it can understand every scene in an image, including the different materials, colors or shapes, and arrangements of multiple objects, as seen in the gif above. For example, AI mode is able to read the titles of the books, capture the theme and commonalities of these books, and suggest similar high-rated books to the user.</p><p>It uses a “query fan-out” technique, just like the text-based search option and AI Mode, then issues multiple queries about the image as a whole and the objects within the image. It is important to note that AI Mode will be made available on both mobile and desktop search versions. However, it remains unclear if it's the same for the Lens feature, as the gif shows only a phone using this new capability.</p>

<p>That said, Google started testing the AI Mode only last month and has since received positive feedback from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers who were able to try it out. Users felt that AI Mode was able to quickly answer their complex and nuanced questions and also gave them a lot more information about a certain topic than a general Google Search.</p><p>Lastly, Google added that it's constantly testing to improve AI Mode based on feedback that comes from users in "Labs." AI Mode is now available on both Android and iOS via the Google app for those with a Google One AI Premium subscription.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's new features are arriving on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series starting today.</li><li>The live video streaming and screen sharing features can be unlocked with a Gemini Advanced subscription.</li><li>These features will expand to all Gemini Advanced users on more Android devices in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's slow rollout of Gemini Live's new video streaming and screen sharing features is now reaching all users of the newest Google and Samsung smartphones. Starting today, April 7, owners of the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series can use the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features with a Gemini Advanced subscription. The company announced the expanded availability in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-android-tips/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Although the tools are starting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineups, they'll later be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-lives-new-video-streaming-and-screen-sharing-to-work-on-any-android-device">available on any Android device</a> that can run the Gemini app. In theory, that means Gemini Live with video streaming and screen sharing should work on Android phone, tablet, or foldable running Android 10.0 or higher.</p><p>The big requirement is the Gemini Advanced subscription, which is available through the Google One AI Premium plan for $20 per month.</p><p>With the new features, users will see two buttons added to the Gemini Live user-interface following the update. There's a camera icon on the left that starts a live video stream, and the stream supports both the front and rear cameras. The button to the right of it is for screen sharing, which only supports sharing the entire screen.</p>

<p>Google provides a few examples of how Gemini Live's live video capabilities can be used, such as for help organizing a drawer or fixing a record player.</p>

<p>For the screen sharing function, Google suggests using Gemini Live to help shop for a particular outfit online.

<p><em><strong>A lot of people ask:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I need to buy a new phone and a particular model caught my eye. Should I buy it or not?</strong></em></p>
<p>A variation of this question is the one I get most often. There are so many phones to choose from, some are obviously going to be better than others, and there is the whole value proposition to look at; you don't want to spend more than you need to or spend it on the wrong thing.</p><p>This question is also one that's impossible for someone else to answer. Good thing it's easy for <em>you</em> to answer, provided you take a bit and consider all you options.</p>
<p>I know, I know, this sounds like a cop-out or a non-answer to a legitimate question. I promise it's not. I have spent more hours than I can count dealing with all aspects of technology and have a good idea of what is good and what isn't, but I don't know what you need and can never know what you want unless you tell me.</p><p>Part of the answer is easier to answer because there are some phones you just shouldn't buy if you need something reliable. If it's made by a company nobody has ever heard of or one we've heard a lot of bad things about, don't consider it. Likewise, read what people who did buy one have to say; if everyone hates it, skip it.</p>

<p>I also tell everyone that being an early adopter often means you end up with a lemon. Never buy the first generation of any new technology if you need something you can depend on; let the people who want one for fun have the first dance. Gen one foldables and their janky busted screens fit nicely here. A few generations later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">they're fine, dependable products</a>.</p><p>That leaves what you <em>should</em> buy. And here's where you have to answer your own question.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-versus-what-you-want-versus-what-you-can-afford-2">What you need versus what you want versus what you can afford</h2>

<p>Once you know these three things, your choices will be narrowed down quite a bit. the trick is being truthful to yourself so you make the right decision.</p><p>I (technically, my wife) was in this situation not too long ago. She needed a phone and she needed it now. She also needed it to be reliable enough to use every day all day, and we didn't have a mountain of money to spend at the time. She decided on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, and I thought that was a smart decision. It's not fancy, it <em>is</em> reliable, and the price was right.</p>
<p>Of course, she <em>wanted</em> more; something a little more fancy or a little more high-end would have made her happy. But knowing what was needed (a basic, reliable phone with acceptable battery life) and what was priced right (we got a great deal thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> promotion) helped me make the right decision. We can put a few dollars back and get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">something she wants</a> later.</p><p>This was a phone emergency, replacing something that was damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>You have to do the same thing. Something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A phone</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel A</a> phone might be a good fit at the right price. Maybe you need to step down and buy an ultra-budget phone (or you just want to save money because you're frugal like that). Or maybe you can splurge and get the latest from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus</a>.</p><p>The point is that only you really know the answer here. Make sure whatever you buy is exactly what you need, with as much of what you want and can afford thrown in.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus president Louis Lee teased what will replace the Alert Slider on the 13T: the new "shortcut key."</li><li>The key is said to be "very practical" while also paying homage to the Alert Slider by including various notification modes.</li><li>The 13T was previously teased to arrive with a 6.3-inch flat display and (potentially) a 6,000mAh battery when it launches later in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is continuing to tease its next smartphone launch by giving users some early details about a new feature.</p><p>Over the weekend, OnePlus president <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/Pm85QiJQd?pagetype=profilefeed">Louis Lee teased</a> what consumers can expect from the OnePlus 13 Mini, otherwise known as the OnePlus 13T (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/07/oneplus-13t-alert-slider-button-flat-display-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). In a post on Weibo, Lee stated the OnePlus 13T had been "upgraded;" however, this change will see the company's famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-alert-slider">Alert Slider</a> disappear (once again), replaced by a "shortcut key."</p><p>Lee didn't get too descriptive about this new physical button, but he mentions (machine-translated) the shortcut key lets users "easily switch between options in a series of operations, which is very practical." The shortcut key pays tribute to the Alert Slider by supporting different notification modes: silent, vibrating, and ringing. There is more to this new button, which Lee states will be revealed "at a later date."</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee builds hype for the OnePlus 13T's display. The post highlights OnePlus user feedback by stating it questioned users who enjoy small-screen phones. The information received reportedly influenced the Chinese OEM's decision behind the 13T's small, flat display. Lee claims, "Everyone who has used it likes it very much."</p>

<p>You could say the Alert Slider is an iconic part of the OnePlus design, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-wants-to-change-alert-slider-and-fans-arent-having-it">many others may agree with you</a>. The OEM's CEO, Pete Lau, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">announced</a> in March that it was moving away from the button, opting for a new option that's more personalized. There was quite an uproar on the company's official forums from long-time users who've come to love the unique piece of utility. However, OnePlus seems to feel otherwise as Lau stated the new button (shortcut key) is “incredibly intuitive” and “future-ready.”</p><p>While Lau expressed love for the Alert Slider, there were also concerns that it would eventually be reduced to "minimal functionality." The Alert Slider is reportedly non-reprogrammable due to certain limitations.</p><p>In other news, April held a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-exec-teases-the-oneplus-13t-will-be-a-tiny-phone-with-a-big-battery">teasers from a OnePlus exec</a> who stated the 13T will feature a 6.3-inch display with a large battery. Nothing's confirmed; however, it's been rumored that the phone could sport a 6,000mAh battery, similar to its flagship sibling.
