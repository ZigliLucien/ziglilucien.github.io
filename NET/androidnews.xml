Bose discontinued its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/bose-sleepbuds-ii-review">Sleepbuds</a> without a replacement, and Philips did the same. That leaves only a handful of reputable brands making high-quality sleep earbuds in 2025.</p><p>One of those brands is Soundcore, a subdivision of Anker, whose Sleep A10 and Sleep A20 are <em>both</em> on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-sleep-headphones">best sleep earbuds list</a>. Now, the company is taking pre-orders on Kickstarter for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.soundcore.com/sleep-a30-smart-anc-earbuds-for-sleeping" target="_blank">next-generation Sleep A30</a>. For the first time, the Soundcore Sleep A30 feature active noise-canceling, but also come along with a $50 price hike compared to the prior model.</p><p>I've been testing (and sleeping with) the Soundcore Sleep A30 for a week, and they knock it out of the park. As a side sleeper, I was impressed with how the Sleep A30 earbuds managed to comfortably stay in my ears most nights with zero pressure or discomfort the morning after. The sound quality and active noise-canceling are great considering the earbuds' size, too.</p><p>However, a steep retail price of $230 means that interested buyers should consider whether the Sleep A30 can double as everyday or workout earbuds to make the investment worthwhile.</p><h2 id="comfort-is-top-notch-with-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Comfort is top-notch with the Soundcore Sleep A30</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-9" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFqoLXFFpCjdYAnHpqCd87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Above all else, comfort is the most important aspect of sleep earbuds. They need to be designed to be compatible with a variety of sleeping positions and preferences, and they're especially tricky for side sleepers like me. Sleep earbuds that are too bulky and protrude from your ear canal too much will cause discomfort as soon as your head hits the pillow.</p><p>Soundcore's Sleep A10 and A20 were already outstanding in this regard, as they kept an ultra-low profile. That gets better with the Sleep A30, as these earbuds are 7% smaller than the older models. This was immediately noticeable because after twisting the buds into my ears, they sit nearly flush. While lying on my side, I quickly forgot the earbuds were in my ears at all.</p><p>Something that shocked me while testing the Soundcore Sleep A30 was how well they fit securely in my ears without creating pressure or congestion. Usually, when I wear earbuds to sleep, they either fall out during the night or cause a ton of congestion after waking up. Neither happened while testing the Sleep A30 — I never felt discomfort, and the earbuds only fell out on one occasion.</p><p>Some of this can be attributed to the Sleep A30's small form factor, and the rest results from excellent ventilation.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-3" alt="The wingtip sizes and instructions that come with the Soundcore Sleep A30." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ek2bCEYwGta8yAJTKCLpU7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-2" alt="The silicone and memory foam eartips that come with the Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwNfGbXtcgAJQvTCQyjeA7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I used the medium silicone eartip on the left earbud and the small silicone eartip on the right, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-best-fit-your-true-wireless-earbuds">plenty of customizable tips included</a> in the box. You get four sizes of silicone eartips and three sizes of foam eartips, plus three sets of wings. Between the flexible wings that help lock the earbuds in place and the variety of tip sizes and materials, just about everyone should find a Sleep A30 combination that works for them.</p><p>Soundcore explains that the silicone eartips will probably be more comfortable, while the foam eartips have better sound isolation and a firmer fit. If you can deal with the slight hassle, I'd consider wearing the silicone ones to sleep and workout, with the foam ones being best for daily wear.</p><h2 id="sound-quality-and-anc-are-better-than-you-d-probably-expect-2">Sound quality and ANC are better than you'd probably expect</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-8" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQdgAtaPekcccXfoATp8h7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, sound quality isn't the main goal for sleep earbuds. These aren't going to replace my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, AirPods Pro 2, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> in terms of sound quality, but the Sleep A30 held their own. There wasn't an overemphasis on any part of the soundstage — you can make out the lows, mids, and highs.</p><p>You do get booming bass with the right song, simply because the passive sound isolation is so good that the vibrations stay mostly trapped within your ear canal. There is a sense of warmth in the Sleep A30's sound signature, but I didn't mind it, especially considering their intended purpose. The volume is also excellent, allowing you to sleep at 50% or below comfortably, which is great for battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-7" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7SGqeTuArWSmtKm2qnWno7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over Bluetooth, you get 6.5 hours of playback with ANC on for each earbud, and a total of 35 hours with the charging case, according to Soundcore. This was about what I experienced during firsthand testing. After a full night of Bluetooth listening, my Sleep A30 earbuds were dead or almost dead when I woke up. In local mode, while listening to white noise or nature sounds downloaded to the earbuds themselves, that bumps to nine hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>This is all with active noise-canceling enabled, so you can presumably squeeze out some extra battery life by flipping that toggle off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-App" alt="The Soundcore app showing the Sleep A30 settings and screenshots." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MXL4vLzSCyfYiEFSygGFic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-5-review">The app is solid</a>, with controls for ANC, sleep sounds, alarms, AI features, and more. However, you'll probably use it more than you'd like. The on-earbuds controls leave a bit to be desired. A double-tap of the right earbud is supposed to toggle ANC on or off, but these taps can be unreliable. You might find yourself tapping a bunch before the earbuds will recognize it, or just give up and use the app instead.</p><p>The sleep alarms were particularly helpful, as they wake you up more gently than a traditional alarm. Still, they are contingent on your earbuds lasting the entire night on a single charge, so I didn't feel comfortable using the Sleep A30 as my only alarm.</p><p>Active noise-canceling worked as expected, blocking out most sounds without causing discomfort. That said, the Sleep A30 are so good at passive sound isolation that I found I didn't need ANC on most nights, especially while playing music or sounds. This feature could be handy for someone with a specific need to block out sound, like a person living in a noisy shared space.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-soundcore-sleep-a30-2">Should you buy the Soundcore Sleep A30?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7" name="Anker-Soundcore-Sleep-A30-1" alt="The Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUde53R5WDY5wD6FvppnZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Soundcore Sleep A30 are really good, but if you already own a pair of Sleep A10 or Sleep A20, you might not need to upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">Active noise-canceling</a> is the key differentiator here, and people who don't need ANC might prefer to save a few bucks by going with the cheaper Sleep A10 or A20 instead.</p><p>Keeping that in mind, you can make the Sleep A30 a great value despite its $230 retail price if you commit to using them for multiple purposes. A dedicated pair of sleep earbuds is a tough sell at that price, but one that can handle workouts and everyday wear is a much easier one.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-oracle-mkii-review">Oracle MKII</a> showcased what it can deliver in the mid-range, and it built on that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Prestige LTD</a>, a high-end offering with a unique tuning.</p><p>But it's the Monarch series that defines the brand; the Monarch MKIII was introduced at the end of 2023, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii">retails for $999 on Linsoul Audio</a>. Like the Fiio FX15, the Monarch MKIII uses a tribrid configuration of drivers that includes dual dynamic drivers, six Knowles balanced armature drivers, and two Sonion EST drivers within each shell. Combine that with Thieaudio's sound signature, and the Monarch MKIII continue to be a phenomenal choice in 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSGjg3Dpknxbg8gEu6UsZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Thieaudio wanted to differentiate just about every facet of the Monarch MKIII, starting with the design. The IEMs are sold in a standard resin shell, for an additional $100, you can heavily customize the design. There are six shell colors available, and 14 different faceplate options, giving you extensive customizability that you just don't see with other IEMs in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="GgiiXJFtT7n3xjGcE2CiPK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgiiXJFtT7n3xjGcE2CiPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4885" height="2752" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only downside to going with a customized design is that it takes anywhere between two weeks to a month to get the product, but that isn't too bad considering you get a unique style. I got the standard variant, and while it doesn't stand out quite as much as the custom colors, it still looks quite good.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="GKdPBLk5GRSF3e43QHprPK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKdPBLk5GRSF3e43QHprPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4995" height="2814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The shell is made out of a resin material, and you get the usual stainless steel sound tube. Build quality is excellent, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the Monarch MKIII. Fit is quite good too, but the IEM is on the bigger side as these things go, so you may see issues with the fit if you're got smaller ears. That said, it has a contoured design that ensures it stays in place once you wear it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="j5eioYz9efirKD2aStm2TK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j5eioYz9efirKD2aStm2TK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5021" height="2828" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You get a selection of foam and silicone ear tips with the Monarch MKIII, and it isn't any different to what's included with other Thieaudio IEMs, which is a shame. Fiio does a much better job in this regard, with its high-end FX15 coming with double the number of accessories.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PaDKWVvxgM5Frz9rDtW7ZK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PaDKWVvxgM5Frz9rDtW7ZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4985" height="2808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You should still get a decent fit from the options included in the package, and Thieaudio's bundled cable is of a good quality. It connects to the buds via the standard 2-pin connector, and there's an interchangeable plug at the other end that lets you switch between 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 4.4mm with relative ease.</p><p>I like the case Thieaudio provides with its products; it has a durable design and does a good job safeguarding the IEMs and the cable. The packaging itself is suitably high-end, and Thieaudio did a good job in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="US55d6PFknVqToMvXEpFcK" name="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII" alt="Thieaudio Monarch MKIII review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/US55d6PFknVqToMvXEpFcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The standout with the Monarch MKIII is the sound; Thieaudio deserves credit for creating a dynamic sound that shines across various genres.

The mid-range has clean articulation, and vocals shine in particular. Instrument separation is good as well, and ensemble music — like orchestral pieces — sounds great on the IEMs.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

There are 11 presets as standard, and you can customize the lighting via Edifier's ConneX mobile app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bi5qo2QrQZDNtXGMgysGJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The LED lighting doesn't look tacky in the least, and if anything, it gives the QR65 a futuristic design that looks great on a desk. The design itself is clean, and other than Edifier branding, you don't get any logos on the front fascia. The brand includes stands in the package that let you angle the QR65, and this is a welcome addition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2YQdmzdvr2BWBMZobmz7j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The metallic stands look good and complement the look of the QR65, and a minor quibble in this regard is that they have a tagline etched onto the front that says A Passion for Sound. The only other issue I have with the QR65 is that it doesn't come with a remote. I used the remote extensively to control the R1280DBs, and that would have been nice in this scenario as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdMFTGUXeGkXM6ZsUkEgLj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The QR65 doesn't take up that much room on a desk, and as is the case with powered monitors, you get an active speaker (the one on the right), and the left is a passive unit. The right unit has physical controls, including a multifunction button that lets you cycle through connection modes. You also get a volume knob, and an LED brightness knob that lets you adjust the intensity of the lighting or disable it entirely if that isn't to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWcrVQ8v4BKzpkRwUt7kCj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's decent connectivity at the back; you have standard RCA in as well as USB-A, and as I was connecting the QR65 to my Windows gaming rig, I used the latter. What I particularly like is that it has a subwoofer out, and this is handy — I connected the QR65 to an Edifier T5 subwoofer, and it made a huge difference.</p><p>Another differentiator is the ability to connect to your phone via Bluetooth; the QR65 has a Bluetooth 5.3 modem, and I was able to pair it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and several dozen devices in the course of the last 12 months. It even has LDAC integration, so you're able to stream music at up to 96kHz/24-bit over Bluetooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guoaj4WVn2a5D8GCZLmrYj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest plus point of the QR65 is the inclusion of an integrated GaN charger. The rear of the right satellite houses two USB-C ports as well as a USB-A port, and you get 65W of charging potential over the USB PD standard. This feature is the reason why I used the QR65 on my desk for the better part of a year — it's just so much more convenient to charge devices this way.</p><p>The USB-A port goes up to 60W on its own, and the USB-C1 and C2 ports hit 65W individually. They have the standard PD power profiles: 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3a (27W), 12V/3A (36W), and 20V/3.25A (65W). You get the total 65W power budget when both USB-C ports are in use, with the power split into 20W and 45W. I had no issues charging devices with the QR65, and Edifier deserves credit for bundling this feature into its active monitors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j" name="Edifier QR65" alt="Edifier QR65 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPfHnKeFpQ3stzHsHqrr2j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the audio, each unit of the QR65 houses a 1.25-inch tweeter with 15W power alongside a 20W 2.75-inch woofer, with the total RMS power at 70W. There isn't much in the way of sub-bass with these monitors, but that's a given considering the size of the drivers. Other than that, you get a balanced sound with clean mid-bass articulation, natural mids, and good treble.</p><p>Although the sound is quite good in its own right, you'll need to connect a subwoofer to make the most of the QR65's potential. Other than that, Edifier did everything right with the QR65; the monitors have an elegant design, good sound, and 65W GaN charging is the icing on the cake.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="af9b05d4-dbd4-47f4-94ad-d3b7a14f50b0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XueYA98mZruqyxK7Njegse.jpg' alt="Edifier QR65 Active Monitor Speakers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Edifier QR65</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The QR65 is a great studio monitor in its own right, and the inclusion of a 65W GaN charger gives it much greater versatility. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

These features don’t just block the tricks; they also alert you when something shady is going on.</p><p>With Android 16, Google is beefing up your phone’s defenses with the addition of the “Mobile network security” setting. It’ll flag sketchy stuff, like unencrypted connections or networks fishing for your device ID, both common stingray tricks. You’ll also be able to shut off 2G entirely, cutting off one of the easiest ways for snoops to get in.</p><h2 id="stingrays-aren-t-just-for-law-enforcement-2">Stingrays aren’t just for law enforcement</h2><p>While law enforcement agencies have used them for surveillance, they’re not off-limits to shady individuals either.

Supported devices now get a toggle for “network notifications."</p><p>Flip it on, and your phone will alert you if it connects to an unencrypted network or if that network tries to grab your device's unique identifiers.

These phones could show up with some notable differences when compared to their predecessors, according to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-specs"> Android Headlines. </a></p><p>To begin, the Pixel 10 Pro is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display, while the larger XL variant may come with a 6.8-inch display, both of which are reportedly set to sport a 120Hz refresh rate and 3000 nits of peak brightness, similar to their predecessors.  The publication notes that the display as well as the rear glass panel will be protected by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="nvHXow64HatxQTMuokcibb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvHXow64HatxQTMuokcibb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the chip powering these devices, the publication says it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Google's Tensor G5</a>, a notch higher than the G4 Tensor chip that powered the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review"> Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL</a>, backed by 16 GB RAM. Both Pro models could see a higher battery capacity, with the Pixel 10 Pro getting 4,870 mAh capacity, and the Pro XL could show up with a large 5,200 mAh battery, the largest yet for a Google Pixel phone.</p><p>The website further notes that the Pro and Pro XL models will achieve higher charging speeds due to their Qi2 compatibility, with 29W and 39W, respectively, in addition to 15W wireless charging speeds.</p><p>As for the phone's camera, both models are not expected to receive any major camera changes, with the same 50MP primary sensor, 48MP ultrawide lens, 48MP telephoto lens, and a 42MP selfie camera. However, despite similar lenses, the devices are expected to capture higher-quality images, as the website alleges, because the telephoto and ultrawide cameras could see higher apertures, which would allow for brighter and more detailed macro photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-5K1-1420x799" alt="The leaked render of the Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzxQjbFTwGSk3GxfBwxru7.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google might change things up with the phone's storage, the leak suggests that the Pixel 10 Pro will sport 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will skip the 128GB model, and offer 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB — signaling Google's move to offer a premium experience on the XL variant.</p><p>Earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor">rumors</a> suggest that these phones will show up in four colorways: Obsidian, Green, Sterling (Grey), and Porcelain (White).</p><p>However, these are still leaks, and it remains unclear if these specs will show up on the actual device.

Apple say its has two billion. Are these numbers real?</strong></em></p><p>Man, what a cool question. As someone who loves Android <em>and</em> numbers/math, I love it! Thanks so much for asking.</p><p>First, the easy answer: yes, those numbers are real. Google and Apple know they can't just lie about things that are verifiable because the hit to their reputation would be rough, at least for a little while.</p><p>They don't mean what you probably think they mean, though. If you pay attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-android-3-billion-active-devices">what they are saying,</a> you'll notice they never actually say three billion people; they say devices. And the way devices are counted is a little squirrelly, too.</p><p>For the deeper answer, you have to start with what Android is. Android is a trademarked, privately built operating system owned by Google. It is built using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>, the base code given away free for everyone. It's also open source, meaning that you can download the code and build it yourself.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because of its licenses, most changes made to the original AOSP do not have to be open source or have the new code made available. Android is just that: software made using open-source code with changes done by Google, and then further changed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-beta-could-show-up-on-older-galaxy-devices-this-month">companies like Samsung</a>. To use the name Android, you must <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/docs/distribute/googleplay/promote/brand.html" target="_blank">follow all of Google's rules</a>.</p><p>One of those rules is allowing access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a>. For that, the software has to meet a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">bunch of other requirements</a> concerning interoperability, so an app that works for one device should work the same with another. As long as they are the same type of device, that is.</p><p>Remember, an Android device doesn't have to be a phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">Wearables</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablets</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">media streamers,</a> and more can also be powered by Android, and that means they also have access to Google's Play Store and other apps.</p><p>Finally, you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They also run Android in a way, and they are counted when it comes to the more than three billion devices tag.</p><p>How they get counted is what <em>really</em> matters.</p><h2 id="monthly-active-devices-2">Monthly active devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-google-play-store.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro using the Google Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRz7VjmQNEZpKTLXgLv98A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your Android-powered devices regularly communicate with the Play Store if it's turned on and connected to the internet. Besides the analytics that Google loves to collect, they check for updates and work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> to keep bad apps away from the device.</p><p>As long as a device communicates with the Play Store at least once every 30 days, it is counted as an active device. That means it is part of that 3 billion+ statistic. An old phone you have lying around that only gets powered on occasionally will be counted as active for the month(s) it has been turned on at least once. The same goes for a TV box in a spare room you rarely use or a tablet you never pick up.</p><p>This also means that you are <strong>one</strong> user, but your devices are counted individually. I have two Android phones, one for work-related breaking of software and one for me to use. I also have an Android tablet, two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> TV boxes, three Chromebooks, and a smartwatch. I'm one user with eight devices that get counted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If everyone were like me, that would mean that the three billion devices are used by <em>only</em> 375 million separate people. Of course, not everyone has eight devices; some have one, and some have more than eight.</p><p>I'm not able to find any verifiable numbers concerning actual <em>users</em> and not devices. What I've seen ranges from four to seven billion people, but without the methodology showing how the numbers were reached, what they tell me is useless. And I'm not going to guess.</p><p>I can say that there aren't 3 billion+ people out there with an Android phone, though.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The lawmakers, Representative John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi, have apparently pushed the U.S. Commerce Department to look into OnePlus after alleging the devices are collecting user information "without explicit user consent."</p><p>According to the two Representatives, this investigation would "determine" the types of information being collected by OnePlus devices, which could involve "transfers of sensitive personal information and screenshots."</p><p>These lawmakers explain that this interest in an investigation is the result of an "analysis" by a commercial company. It's been reported that the information provided "indicates" potential unwanted data collection by OnePlus devices, which is then sent to China-owned servers.</p><p>In its research, Reuters states the U.S. Commerce Department did not comment immediately about this potential probe. Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this potential probe by the U.S. Commerce Department, but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="cause-for-concern-2">Cause for Concern?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The U.S. government tangled with another recognizable Chinese brand back in 2020. Huawei came under fire after the DOJ (Department of Justice) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-doj-indicts-huawei-racketeering-and-stealing-trade-secrets">indicted the OEM</a> for racketeering and "stealing trade secrets." This went on during President Trump's first term, which granted the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-administration-postpones-full-ban-huawei-another-45-days">a 45-day ban reprieve</a>, but this was for companies here in the States.</p><p>In a statement, the Commerce Department stated the extension on the Temporary General License was to prevent any "disruption" of network communication systems for those in rural areas. Huawei tried to combat its U.S. ban, calling it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-lawsuit-calling-us-ban-unconstitutional-has-been-dismissed">unconstitutional</a>;" however, it was quickly refuted by a judge who dismissed the lawsuit.</p><p>On the other hand, hearing "security concerns" reminds us of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fcc-urges-tiktok-removed-app-stores-over-security-concerns">another ongoing situation</a> in the U.S.: TikTok. In 2022, the ByteDance-owned app was under fire for the belief that it was collecting U.S. user data, which was then being accessed in China. At the time, the U.S. Federal Communications commissioner, Brendan Carr, stated, "it harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show is being accessed in Beijing."</p><p>We've since gone through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">a TikTok ban</a>—and its return—and we're still dealing with it today, as Trump granted the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">a 75-day reprieve</a> back in April. While the Trump Administration has expressed its interest in keeping the app around, it wants to do so in a way that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">ByteDance isn't comfortable with</a>.

I sailed through my teens, 20s, and half of my 30s without giving much thought to my long-term health or wondering if a gym life would be the right fit for me. However, something changed around 35, and I've been using smartwatches, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 3,</a> to track my heart rate and ensure that I'm not overexerting myself.</p><p>But I'm learning that there's so much more to workout tracking than just heart rate monitoring, and it took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit Balance 2</a> to get me to this point. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and have since gone on several hikes, multiple paddleboarding sessions, and plenty of WODs at HEW Fitness, my favorite local CrossFit-style gym.</p><p>And while I've even taken several watches and smart rings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/two-smartwatches-one-spartan-race-no-winners">on Spartan races</a>, a lot of the data I'm given has to be combed through and manually compared in a way that I don't usually take the time to do.

I'm <em>horrible</em> at logging my food. Even the slightest bit of friction to the experience will make me stop. I've tried all the popular apps over the years and have given up on all of them. Doubtless, something better has come along since the advent of modern AI tools like ChatGPT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, but Zepp builds it in for me, and I don't have to juggle multiple apps or services.</p><p>Right on the main screen, I can log food in one of two ways: take a picture or use a voice/text prompt. Just before I wrote this, I went upstairs and grabbed some tuna and crackers for an afternoon snack. I took a picture of the box of crackers and another of the tuna pouch. Bam, afternoon snack logged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW" name="amazfit-zepp-app-ai-powered-food-logging" alt="Logging food in the Zepp app easily with AI voice prompts and photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMypiorMyVi5Dk458HLYJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before that, though, I was really craving some Oreos. I forgot to take a picture of it because I left my phone in my office downstairs, but I know I only took a single serving of Oreos because I'm at least good about looking at the label and grabbing what I should. So I told Zepp I ate "one serving of Oreos." Two seconds later, my poor nutritional choice was logged for AI to judge me with.</p><p>Yep, I could definitely get used to logging food this way. Even taking a quick voice journal of the stuff I ate throughout the day and dropping it into the text prompt section of the app will log everything I ate, from that errant piece of Dominos pizza my friend offered me while we were playing games, to the smoothie I ate with one banana, a cup of almond milk, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and a scoop of protein powder after I left the gym.</p><p>Better yet, the app provides you with insights based on what you've logged, including how much you've exercised, how well you slept, and more. This morning, it suggested that I try adding fruits or vegetables to my breakfast to make it more balanced. After realizing I had forgotten to log my orange juice, that insight alert disappeared.</p><p>Best of all, you don't need a paid subscription or a specific phone to make this all work. This is a dream come true for me, and I can't believe how well it works!</p><h2 id="how-about-the-workouts-2">How about the workouts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB" name="amazfit-balance-2-orange-04" alt="The Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9uktNFJDzKGRG5cML8uTMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love the accuracy and comfort of both the Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3, I've never used a watch that understands what I'm doing quite like the Amazfit Balance 2. This week, two of our WODs (Workout Of the Day) at the gym included barbell exercises. I know from wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watches</a> that some watches are better at tracking workouts like this than others, but the Amazfit Balance 2 was on a totally different level.</p><p>I selected "strength training" before beginning the workout, then selected my weight and the number of reps I planned to do. Each round, I clicked the lower button on the watch, adjusted the weight and number of reps, then hit go.</p><p>After I was done, I sat down to look at the data the watch generated and couldn't believe my eyes. It got all the expected stats — average heart rate, calories burned, etc. — but then I scrolled down and saw the <em>muscle groups</em> I worked. "How could it possibly know this?" I wondered. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> also offer this feature, but they are often slightly more expensive than Amazfit's watches, and I find the app to be somewhat convoluted.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-01" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HChTLpELzoU6C8iitmjhE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Scrolling one more "page" down revealed the answer. During each rep, the Amazfit Balance 2 uses its sophisticated sensors to identify exactly what you're doing during those logged reps. But this isn't just some generic list of activities; this is a list of <strong>thousands</strong> of things, all sorted by different muscle groups.</p><p>OK, so it picked up my deadlifts correctly on Tuesday, but how about Friday's back squats? Surely these activities are similar enough to trick it? Nope. Right in the app after my workout today, "Barbell squats" stared me in the face. It's been a long time since I've felt like technology was magic — my job makes me a little jaded, what can I say — but <em>man</em>, does this feel like magic.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, it also gives me insights for consistency, stability, continuity, rhythm, and speed decay, all with personalized descriptions that actually make sense. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be able to interpret this data in a meaningful way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.82%;"><img id="Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD" name="amazfit-zepp-app-detailed-workout-tracking" alt="Detailed workout data collected by the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch, compiled in an easy to read way by the Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht3DpiQXFv9ehiSUP5fjJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the watch is just as fantastic as this experience, too. So far, it's lasted me nearly a week on a single charge, and there's nothing here that feels like it's a lesser experience when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a>.</p><p>Zepp has an app store that offers a wide range of content, from utilities like calculators to games like Sudoku, yoga courses, and more. I'm not someone who uses extra apps on smartwatches very often, but everything I felt like I needed to use was either already included on the watch or found in the Zepp app store.</p><p>And, much to my surprise, responding to messages on the watch was as easy as could be. At first, I was confused because you have to swipe on a notification to get actions for it — this seems more like an iOS paradigm than an Android one — but once I figured this out, things were swell.</p><p>I've been super impressed with smartwatches lately. The Amazfit Balance 2 feels like another upgrade on my previous favorite, the OnePlus Watch 3, and I think you'll love it, too!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="94122f63-789d-4818-a9d6-dde0de924257">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Sapphire-Display-Offline-Battery/dp/B0F9JFCYNX/" data-model-name="Amazfit Balance 2" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:109.33%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSaiNZg6ZDAPszhXuEhQvg.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch with an orange band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Amazfit Balance 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get insightful AI-powered coaching that actually works!

The support page says that "Garmin will not receive any data from Google," which means you can't do a workout with a Galaxy or Pixel Watch and see the results in Garmin Connect.</p><p>As of the morning of June 30, the latest Play Store update of Health Connect doesn't show Garmin Connect.

There are roughly 30 new features that are on the way and rolling out today (June 30) for no extra cost. Gemini and NotebookLM are at the core of a few features educators can expect "in the coming months." Regarding the former, Google states educators can soon utilize Gems (custom Gemini versions) for their students.</p><p>Teachers can create a specific variant of Gemini based on their teaching material. This will create a Gemini that's an "expert" in that particular subject, bringing tailored assistance to students who may need extra help or would like to dive deeper into their learning.</p><p>NotebookLM comes in to create "interactive study guides and podcast-style Audio Overviews." Students can run through these guides to understand them better in a more condensed way, and the Audio Overviews can open chances for questions.</p><h2 id="furthering-education-with-a-gemini-assistant-2">Furthering Education with a Gemini Assistant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A" name="google-classroom-notebooklm-study-guide" alt="Google Classroom gains NotebookLM to create useful study guides for students with Audio Overviews." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpwvDPGHucAzWdhD2RnS2A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.13%;"><img id="WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9" name="google-classroom-ai-teaching-tools" alt="Google is rolling out over 30 new AI features for educators, like create a lesson plan or create a rubric or quiz." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoxfsUQznzofZCuCAS3zz9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What teachers can expect starting today (June 30), Google highlights Gemini's ability to "generate content from a central destination in Classroom." The post states some early participants have been playtesting Gemini's capabilities in Classrooms and features like "outline lesson plan" or "create a quiz."</p><p>The AI will get its information straight from your available content, which some users claim is "quick and easy," especially when looking to create a rubric for students. When it comes to creating lesson plans with Gemini, Google states educators need to provide a "target grade and topic" before the AI can deliver a first draft. Teachers can continue to revise the lesson plan with Gemini, as it suggests potential useful videos and more.</p><p>These features are starting to roll out globally for educators in English "over the coming weeks." If you're interested in joining Google's pilot program, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edu.google.com/pilot/">sign up for the AI track</a> in Classroom.</p><p>To end, Google highlighted a few features that it has plans to implement in Classroom for educators. These features include a more "flexible" Read Along mode. Teachers can now upload their own content; however, there are plans to introduce Gemini-created stories for "real-time support" for books students may be interested in. Educators are also gaining a "silent reading mode" and a "listening mode" soon for comprehension insights.</p><p>Soon, Classroom will receive support for the learning standards of learning institutions. Google says it knows that not every institution abides by the same standards, so it has partnered with 1EdTech and Common Good Learning Tools to give such places the ability to publish their standard via CASE Network 2. Moreover, "in the coming months," educators will be able to "tag coursework with relevant learning standards or skills, and view new analytics of student performance."</p><p>Google reiterates an earlier Classroom rollout in June that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/06/new-class-analytics-and-insights-in-google-classroom.html">new analytics and insights</a> to educators about their students.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Motorola also added a massive 5,000mAh battery with 68W wired and 15W wireless charging.

But Samsung’s Galaxy A36 holds its ground with more software updates and a sleeker overall design. Lets take a deeper look at thiese two mid-range phones.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-design-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 face down with the pen on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As expected in this Moto G Stylus 2025 vs Samsung Galaxy A36 analysis, the two phones share more than a few design choices. Both feature an under-display fingerprint sensor, a plastic frame, a USB-C port, right-side buttons, and rounded corners. Beyond those shared design options, the Moto G Stylus 2025 adopts a more distinctive design approach.</p><p>Motorola’s phone borrows design cues from its premium lineup, with a look that loosely resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch" target="_blank">Edge 50 Ultra</a>. It stands out with a stove-like camera housing and a vegan leather back, offering more texture and grip than the Galaxy’s smooth glass. It's also slightly lighter, weighing 191g, and comes in two bold Pantone shades: Gibraltar Sea (deep blue) and Surf the Web (vibrant medium blue).</p><p>The phone measures 162.2 x 74.8 x 8.3mm and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, which is noticeably less durable than Samsung’s choice. However, Motorola compensates for this with a higher IP68 rating, making the phone more water-resistant than the Galaxy A36, which Samsung claims can survive submersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-lifestyle-official-169.jpg" alt="Galaxy A36 5G lifestyle ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x29TmvkFSEihfYMYfBi3Gb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1062" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Motorola goes for bold and textured, the Galaxy A36 leans into Samsung's signature sleekness. The phone has a more refined shape than previous A-series models, featuring flat edges and subtle curves around the buttons that make it more comfortable to hold. Thinner bezels give the display a more modern look, and the new pill-shaped camera layout gives it a more cohesive rear design.</p><p>Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the front and a glass back that gives it a more premium look. Whether you prefer something subtle or bold, the phone is available in black, white, lime, and lavender. It weighs 195g, making it heavier than the Moto, and measures 162.9 x 78.2 x 7.4mm. The Galaxy A36 boasts a respectable IP67 rating, but it falls short of its rival's higher protection level.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-display-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL" name="samsung galaxy a36 gaming" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NTqHZmim9npGfBE5EkL5hL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones feature a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh. However, Samsung uses a Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy A36, while the Moto G Stylus 2025 opts for a standard pOLED. That gives Samsung a slight edge in color tuning and contrast, especially in bright environments.</p><p>Where they really start to differ is in brightness, resolution, and overall utility. The Moto G Stylus 2025 pushes ahead with a higher 1220 x 2712 resolution, 3,000-nit peak brightness, and a larger 89.3% screen-to-body ratio. It also comes with a built-in stylus, making it more practical for note-taking and creative work.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 has a lower peak brightness of 1,900 nits and a 1080 x 2340 resolution, accompanied by a smaller screen-to-body ratio of 86.5%. Between the sharper resolution, higher peak brightness, and extra utility of the stylus, the Moto G Stylus 2025 clearly comes out ahead in this category.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-hardware-and-specs-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A36-5G-snapdragon" alt="The Galaxy A36" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooFZxsECmu2UZXsCbmsCEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1597" height="898" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Android phones share a surprising amount of hardware for two budget-friendly phones.

The Moto G Stylus 2025 supports 68W wired charging and even incorporates 15W wireless charging, a rare feature in this price range. It comes with a 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C sensor, a 13MP ultrawide, and a 32MP front-facing camera that shoots 4K videos and delivers impressive detail. You can expand the Moto G Stylus 2025’s storage up to 1TB via microSD, and it comes in a single 8GB RAM configuration that still runs smoothly.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A36 includes a triple camera setup with a 50MP Sony IMX882 sensor, an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro lens. Both the front and back cameras can also record in 4K, but the selfie camera on this model is only 12MP. Samsung offers more flexibility with 6GB, 8GB, or 12GB of RAM, but availability varies by region, and the Galaxy A36 doesn’t offer expandable storage. It supports 45W wired charging, but it doesn’t offer wireless charging.</p><h2 id="moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-a36-software-2">Moto G Stylus 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy A36: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V" name="samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-official-battery-ad-169.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A36 5G in front of battery shape segmented into lifestyle images" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBis82cK9vYnAaS27WKZ3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 ships with Android 15 and Hello UX out of the box, a near-stock interface with limited customization options that feels less flexible than what you'd find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones" target="_blank">OnePlus phones</a>.

Considering that NotebookLM started out as a limited research project in 2023, earning its own mobile app is a big milestone for the AI-powered study tool.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> mobile app has almost completely replaced the web-based equivalent for me, I was skeptical that this would be the same for the NotebookLM app.</p><p>Despite the name, NotebookLM isn't a note-taker like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-still-sucks-that-the-iphone-gets-new-apps-before-android">Notion</a>. It's more of a research and study tool, capable of using AI to parse and converse about complex topics with a lot of specific context.</p><p>As it turns out, I was both right and wrong to be skeptical of NotebookLM's Android app. It's going to be a helpful companion for existing NotebookLM users, but it likely won't be a great first impression of the service for new users. The Gemini-powered research tool is simply better suited for the desktop — let me explain why.</p><h2 id="what-s-good-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's good about the NotebookLM mobile app </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-5" alt="The Studio tab in the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esENjZVHzxQ7UN259jGHxi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with a high-level overview of what NotebookLM does. It takes a collection of sources about a topic to form a "notebook." Each of these sources can contain up to 500,000 words, and you can put 50 of them into a single notebook. This gives your NotebookLM project its own context based on the sources provided, whether they be websites, YouTube videos, PDF files, or your own notes.</p><p>After you've selected your sources, a Gemini model within NotebookLM gets to work. It's not always clear <em>which</em> Gemini model is at work — Google seems to update it often, but we know it's at least a tweaked version of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">the Gemini 2.5 series is already stable and public</a>, it's possible the model working behind the scenes has been updated.</p><p>From there, NotebookLM can do a lot — including chat with you based on the context of your sources, provide summaries, generate spoken Audio Overviews, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-2" alt="The button in the NotebookLM app for Android that lets you join an Audio Overview conversation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GEaCNGk4w6kuzx7GXF2bpi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mobile version of NotebookLM works best with notebooks you've already created. After opening the app for the first time, you're greeted with a list of your existing notebooks alongside the option to create a new one. With sources already uploaded, one of your current notebooks is ready to go for text-based chats or spoken Audio Overviews.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> are the best part of the NotebookLM app, as they can be downloaded to your device for offline listening. Of course, this takes a while — the generation process for an Audio Overview takes around 5-10 minutes, and the download takes additional time on top of that. It's such a lengthy process that the app reminds you that you can close it and do something else while an Audio Overview is created. And sometimes, it'll fail entirely.</p><p>But when it does work, it's pretty glorious. You can listen to the podcast-style Audio Overview based on your study topic while driving, taking the train, or doing just about everything else. Downloaded content helps eliminate some of the stutters you might experience while trying to play an Audio Overview on a mobile network. You can also "join" an Audio Overview to get your podcast hosts on the exact topic you need help with, which is neat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-6" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hdadu3ou4FF7KWC6TXV2i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Audio Overviews are perhaps the most popular feature included with NotebookLM — so popular that they've since been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">added to the Gemini app</a> and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-search-test-understand-confusing-topics-test">experiment in Search Labs</a>. Really, it feels like the NotebookLM mobile app for iOS and Android is just a player for Audio Overviews, because aside from the chat function, there's not much else this app can do at the moment.</p><p>That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it's important to keep your expectations tame if you try this app as a potential replacement for your favorite note-taker.</p><h2 id="what-s-bad-about-the-notebooklm-mobile-app-2">What's bad about the NotebookLM mobile app</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-1" alt="The homepage of NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WVC4YcFLZzpaiVtFyaEKLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The limitations of the NotebookLM mobile app compared to the web client are why I kept wanting to use the fully-featured desktop experience instead. One of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">the best NotebookLM features added recently</a> is called <strong>Discover sources</strong>, and it effectively takes the work out of your hands when creating a new notebook. You'll type in a few keywords, like "Algebra I" or "The American Revolution," and NotebookLM will find good sources on the web and automatically add 10 of them to a new notebook.</p><p>There's also an <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong> button, which is a nod to Google Search's <strong>I'm feeling lucky </strong>button. As you might have guessed, this tool picks a random topic, finds sources about it, and adds it to a new notebook. It's perfect for the curious-minded person who just loves to learn new things.</p><p>I was excited to use this feature in the NotebookLM mobile app, but I quickly found out that it wasn't there. It's quite disappointing because the process of adding sources to a notebook using the Android app is tedious. It involves a ton of window-switching and copying that isn't suited for a small screen, even if the NotebookLM shortcut in the Android share card is handy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-7" alt="Adding sources to the NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FnBoP3fWh9CL34MmRodxki.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, it feels like a missed opportunity, and it isn't the only one. You also can't <em>create</em> a note on the NotebookLM mobile app. On the web, you can make a brand-new, text-based note in a notebook on the fly and later convert it to a source. This feature is notably absent on the mobile app, and it severely limits its capabilities as an Android note-taker.</p><h2 id="for-now-the-notebooklm-web-client-isn-t-going-anywhere-2">For now, the NotebookLM web client isn't going anywhere</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph" name="NotebookLM-Android-app-4" alt="The NotebookLM app for Android running on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CfK7npL5W75YZpYFzEdph.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, Google is aware of these limitations. In its introductory blog post, the company said that "this first version of the app includes many of the core features of NotebookLM — with more refinements and features to come in the months ahead." I'm hopeful that in the future, the NotebookLM app will become on par with its desktop counterpart.</p><p>For now, though, the NotebookLM app on iOS and Android isn't that useful. It's the only way to download Audio Overviews to your mobile device, so if that feature sounds appealing to you, it's worth using. Otherwise, you should probably stick to the web client — that's what I'm going to do.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Having used the StormBox Blast, the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tribit-stormbox-blast-2-ultimate-bluetooth-party-speaker">StormBox Blast 2</a>, and the diminutive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a>, I can say with some confidence that Tribit knows what it's doing in this area.</p><p>The Blast 2 continues to be a terrific all-rounder if you need a party speaker, but it is quite heavy, and it's overkill in most situations. That's where the StormBox Lava slots in; it is considerably smaller — and easily portable — but you still get 80W of sound in total, and all the extras. The StormBox Lava is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Portable-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B0DN5F9BC2">available for $139 on Amazon</a>, and that's a decent value when you consider the caliber of the sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other StormBox products, the Lava has a design that doesn't grab much attention. It's sold in a black color option, and while the build quality is great, you miss out on fun colors that are offered with Bose and Ultimate Ears products. That's a minor quibble as these things go, because the color ultimately doesn't make much of a difference in usability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rS8i9zmSaBJifrdyosUWoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Lava has an oblong design, and while it doesn't have 360-degree sound, you get four audio drivers that deliver a total of 80W of power. The back of the unit houses the ports — behind a protective cap — and you get USB-A alongside USB-C and a 3.5mm jack. Thankfully, the Lava charges via the standard USB-C port, so you don't have to worry about using a dedicated barrel connector.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHK8oZCULJBhVgXsxvEpdT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jbtekFH8wyUoiJuW26aSZT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZw2LkmgKiJf9VcNyNGYTT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What I like about the Lava is that it gets a strap that lets you carry it around.

The sound quality in general is oriented toward bass-focused music, and if that's what you like listening to, you'll definitely enjoy the tonality of the Lava.</p><p>Tribit lets you adjust the sound to some degree via its mobile app, and although there isn't a 10-band EQ, you get to tweak the sound in a meaningful way. The speaker has rubber feet at the bottom that ensures it stays planted, and at 6.13lb, it isn't heavy enough that it's cumbersome to carry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT" name="Tribit StormBox Lava" alt="Tribit StormBox Lava Bluetooth review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BoDd4rvrXBJpF8iQ2h7TeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of that weight has to do with the battery; the StormBox Lava has a 42.3Wh battery, and it delivers over 18 hours of use between charges with XBass mode enabled. That's a good thing, because charging the speaker takes over five hours, and there's no fast charging. An interesting addition is reverse charging — you can use the Lava to charge your phone at 10W.</p><p>The only feature that's missing is high-res codecs; the Lava has the standard SBC and AAC codecs, and you don't get any AptX. This is an issue with most Bluetooth speakers anyway, and honestly, it isn't a huge limiting factor. At the end of the day, the StormBox Lava produces highly detailed sound with a clear bass-focused signature, and it's a definite contender if you need a powerful Bluetooth party speaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40b006-9df4-49c6-8ead-fb1e9140089c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.29%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQxtChvydi678rAbtAoptm.jpg' alt="Tribit StormBox Lava"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Tribit StormBox Lava</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With powerful sound and a portable design, the Lava is a terrific Bluetooth party speaker. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

These kinds of patents—like the one tied to “control signal mapping” for LTE—are supposed to be shared fairly across the industry under FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms.

The BeeStation Plus is sold in a single configuration with an 8TB integrated hard drive (BST170-8T), and while we may get additional storage models down the line, that isn't the case right now.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-design-and-features"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GC6HYYUbHv3uspQnU6CNnE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GC6HYYUbHv3uspQnU6CNnE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The BeeStation Plus looks identical to the regular model, and Synology didn't change the design to any noticeable degree. The design is just as unobtrusive as DiskStation models; you essentially get a black box that you slow next to your router, and the vertical chassis doesn't take up much room.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rgxZ92uVJrAExJbtphBArE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rgxZ92uVJrAExJbtphBArE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The front has an LED status indicator, but is otherwise plain. You get BeeStation branding on the sides, and the back has the power button, USB-A and USB-C connectors, and a solitary Gigabit Ethernet port. There's no active cooling, with the BeeStation Plus instead getting a ventilated design at the top and bottom that cools the integrated hard drive passively.</p><p>The NAS is powered by the Intel Celeron J4125, and it comes with 4GB of RAM, which is a good choice as there's no way to extend the memory on the device. There's an 8TB HAT3310 drive integrated into the NAS, and that alone makes up half of the $409 asking price.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-performance"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Performance</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pzMyC324CSEZfDpeNxPr5F" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzMyC324CSEZfDpeNxPr5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the regular BeeStation, Synology is careful to not dub the BeeStation Plus as a NAS; instead, it is a "private and family cloud storage" solution. The difference is evident when you set up the product; unlike the traditional DiskStation Manager (DSM) software, the BeeStation Plus uses BeeStation OS, which is a lightweight OS that has limited utilities.</p><p>You get just BeePhotos and BeeFiles as standard, and these two utilities are derivatives of what Synology provides on its DiskStation models. If anything, the mobile BeePhotos app is nearly identical to Synology Photos — which is a good thing. I like that the brand retooled its existing utilities instead of reinventing the wheel.</p><p>That said, you miss out on most of the extras that you get on standard DiskStation models. There's no way to install apps on the BeeStation Plus, nor can you use it as a mail server, private audio streaming platform, or any of the other useful features you get on most DiskStation devices.</p><p>If anything, that's the allure of the BeeStation Plus; it's billed as a hassle-free solution that lets you store photos and other data in a centralized area, and it does just as good a job backing up data from connected devices. I didn't see any issues with uploading photos and videos taken on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> to the device via BeePhotos (it automatically uploads photos to the BeeStation Plus in the background), and I was able to back up data from my gaming rig with relative ease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="75QPHvrkgzXNhthRQwygCF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/75QPHvrkgzXNhthRQwygCF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the ability to back up data from public cloud provides like Google Drive to the NAS, and that's just handy. You get user management as well — allowing you to share the BeeStation Plus with family members — and it uses the same relay network as DiskStation models when connecting to the device from outside your home network.</p><p>You can do these things with the regular BeeStation as well — where the BeeStation Plus stands out is the ability to stream media. You can install Plex, and set up a media server on the device that lets you stream movies and TV shows to any device in your house. Plex isn't installed out of the box; you'll need to go into the system settings and select the Integration tab to download the media server, but as soon as it's installed, it's just as easy to set up and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZwQ6yTWg2UjoPqEEX5aXSF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwQ6yTWg2UjoPqEEX5aXSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the hardware, the BeeStation Plus has the Intel Celeron J4125, a stalwart in this category. I used dozens of NAS models powered by this platform, and it is a reliable workhorse that delivers good performance and hardware transcoding. While it is showing its age, there aren't any issues in day-to-day use, and the BeeStation Plus does a good job when it comes to backing up data as well as streaming media to connected devices on your home network.</p><p>Actually, the fact that the BeeStation Plus has transcoding gives it a definite advantage over some of the newer DiskStation models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">DiskStation DS925+</a>. I didn't notice any problems using Plex on the BeeStation Plus, and it handled 4K content as well as transcodes effortlessly. The BeeStation Plus is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS models</a>, and if you just need the essentials, this is the ideal product.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-the-alternatives"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EeYgQsd4HN4ZHmE7VCmDAF" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EeYgQsd4HN4ZHmE7VCmDAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't want an integrated solution and instead need the extensibility of a full-fledged NAS, the DiskStation DS224+ is the model to get. It has the same Celeron J4125 platform as the BeeStation Plus, and you get the full DiskStation Manager software, allowing you to install a host of extras. The downside is that you don't get a built-in drive, so it will be costlier to buy the NAS and an 8TB drive — it comes out to around $500.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-synology-beestation-plus-should-you-buy-it"><span>Synology BeeStation Plus: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="83aX3bS558zDsD8gxYtVkE" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83aX3bS558zDsD8gxYtVkE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need an all-in-one media server</li><li>You want integrated storage</li><li>You need an easy way to back up photos and data</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need a full-fledged NAS</li></ul><p>With the BeeStation Plus, Synology is proving that it is listening to customer feedback. The standard BeeStation is a good idea done well, but the lack of media streaming made it a non-starter to most consumers looking to get started with network-attached storage, and the BeeStation Plus solves that quandary.</p><p>So if you're just getting started with a centralized storage solution and want something that's easy to set up and use, I highly recommend the BeeStation Plus. It may not have the added utilities that you get with DiskStation NAS models, but it excels at the basics, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">terrific as a Plex media server</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="20d6f9c5-19af-407b-a5bf-ae9287adbf10">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:74.73%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF9G3yx3mXrCnSEd7RSBpH.jpg' alt="Synology BeeStation Plus render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Synology BeeStation Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The BeeStation Plus is a great choice if you need an all-in-one media streaming solution that also backs up photos and data from your phones and other devices. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Mostly that comes down to new features like running tolerance, impact load, and projected race time, along with all the training load tools you know and love. But you're also paying $750 for the best possible accuracy.</p><p>So, how accurate is the Garmin Forerunner 970 for GPS tracking, heart rate, step count, and supporting data like training load? I put its Elevate v5 HR sensor, dual-band GPS, and other sensors to the test across weeks of activities, comparing its results against satellite maps, chest and arm HR straps, and my usual step-counting app.</p><p>The end result? The Forerunner 970 is shockingly accurate. It gives you reliable health and fitness data from workouts, then spits out data from its algorithm that predicts your cardiovascular and biomechanical fatigue with surprising accuracy.</p><p>It sucks that the Forerunner 970 price tag is so high, but Garmin makes a valiant effort at justifying it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-heart-rate-accuracy"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: Heart rate accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NPsyNNMgmUcfkVYGA9egab" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-polar-h10-and-coros-hrm" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a Polar H10 chest strap with the COROS HRM armband to its left." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPsyNNMgmUcfkVYGA9egab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Across several runs, I used my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">Polar H10</a> chest strap and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM</a> armband as control groups against the Forerunner 970. Optical armbands are more consistent and responsive than wrist-based optical sensors in my experience, a good comparison point. Chest straps are the gold standard, but smartwatches <em>always</em> trail behind them; your best hope is for the results to be close.</p><p>First, I used the Forerunner 970 and Polar H10 on a short jog to a track, then a hard track workout. For the first activity, both devices ended with a 145bpm average and 157bpm max, but I'd expect similar results for such a short run.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2041px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.47%;"><img id="uTd4XLb64b7q5hhQyRSanW" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-vs-Polar-H10-HR-results-chart-jog" alt="A heart rate graph superimposing the results from one run from the Polar H10 chest strap and Garmin Forerunner 970." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTd4XLb64b7q5hhQyRSanW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2041" height="928" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The chart shows that the Forerunner 970 responds rapidly when my heart rate climbs, but is about 10 seconds slower to recognize falling heart rates than the chest strap.</p><p>(Side note: Polar tracks HR when an activity is paused, but the exported graph shows a flat line, weirdly.

Even fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review#section-coros-pace-pro-gps-heart-rate-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> have problems with anaerobic data.</p><p>The Forerunner 970 did end 1 bpm short of the H10 strap for HR average, but all that matters to me is that I can count on the Forerunner 970 to be accurate <em>in the moment</em> when I look at my wrist mid-sprint and see my heart rate. That's surprisingly rare!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2097px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.93%;"><img id="ED45vN3eg3T4ekDntQqwNQ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-vs-COROS-HRM-HR-results-chart-run" alt="A heart rate graph showing how the Garmin Forerunner 970 HR compares against a COROS HRM armband across a ten-mile run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ED45vN3eg3T4ekDntQqwNQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2097" height="1005" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, I ran with my Garmin Forerunner 970 and COROS PACE Pro synced to my COROS HRM strap across a ten-mile run. Interestingly, the 970 showed my minimum, average, and maximum heart rate as 1 bpm higher than COROS's data.</p><p>These graphs are pretty well synced; Garmin just detected that I was working slightly harder than COROS. The gap is so small that it wouldn't affect your training load data.</p><p>Ultimately, I'd say the Forerunner 970's Elevate v5 sensor shows a slight tendency to overestimate my heart rate by about 1 bpm, but otherwise is as dependable as I'd hope for in this price range. I don't feel the need to wear an external HRM with the 970 for the best results, something I can't usually say with most fitness watches.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-gps-accuracy"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: GPS accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QQ82FEMUYUj5MjL6VuXqn3" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-training-weeks" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on an armrest showing my tolerance, acute impact load miles, and actual miles in a chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQ82FEMUYUj5MjL6VuXqn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> with dual-band GPS almost always perform seamlessly in my tests. Since I knew the Forerunner 970 would match its siblings, I focused instead on testing whether its default SatIQ mode — which sticks to GPS only until it needs the other satellites to save battery — was adequate, or if runners should stick to dual-band GPS only.</p><p>For my ten-mile run, I used "Best accuracy" on both my Forerunner 970 and COROS PACE Pro; both ended at 10.01 miles and showed a minuscule gap of six feet at the end. It's <em>awesome</em> to see both brands be in such close lockstep over a long distance.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

When I wore <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">six watches for 6,000 steps</a>, the Forerunner 265 did the best, only 15 steps off. Last year, the Forerunner 965 was 17 steps off after 5,000 steps, but some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">smart rings did slightly better</a>. The Garmin Fenix 8 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">50 steps off after 10,000 steps</a>, and my colleague Derrek found that the Forerunner 570 was 40 steps off in his own test.</p><p>These results are all pretty solid, and Garmin watches are great at avoiding false-positive steps during the day. However, the pricier models didn't yield better results, and Garmin has never mentioned upgrading its accelerometers or gyroscopes. I assumed the Forerunner 970 step count accuracy would be comparable.</p><p>I started the test with 1,735 steps and walked for 5,000 steps, holding my phone in my right hand to track them with a counting app while my left arm swung freely. At 5,000 steps, I took another four steps to sit down on a bench and checked the total: 6,739 steps. Yep, 5,004 <strong>exactly</strong>.</p><p>I felt simultaneously stunned at the accuracy and annoyed that people probably wouldn't believe the result. So I stood back up and walked another 5,000 steps as twilight fell into evening to check if it was a fluke.</p><p>I checked my total: 11,740 steps, aka another 5,001. That makes the Forerunner 970 <strong>off by one step after 10,000</strong>.</p><p>I can't guarantee you'll get comparably exact results; it may depend on your gait, or if you hold a phone or trekking pole in your watch-side hand. But personally, I'm thrilled knowing that when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a>, the Forerunner 970 will track every step without fail.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-forerunner-970-overall-accuracy"><span>Garmin Forerunner 970: Overall accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.93%;"><img id="RXZm8jdtMRVFbQ9dvfxkya" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-acute-impact-load-miles-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting atop a running shoe, showing the Acute Impact Load Miles widget with the runner's current mileage compared to their weekly tolerance and actual weekly mileage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RXZm8jdtMRVFbQ9dvfxkya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartwatch accuracy goes well beyond the raw data. It's also about whether the Garmin Forerunner 970's training data is both accurate and helpful.</p><p>At the core of Garmin's Firstbeat Analytics data is your VO2 Max, lactate threshold, training load focus, and recovery time. These focus on cardiovascular data, and while I can't <em>know</em> if my VO2 Max is accurate without going to a lab, its rises and falls do correspond to real-life changes in fitness — but slowly.</p><p>I personally prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/endurance-score/">Endurance Score</a>, which shows my fitness trends across the past few months that will translate into actual speed and longevity during runs, with more exact data than the VO2 Max graph shows. And it's only available on high-end models like the 970 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>Generally speaking, the 970's recovery time estimates have been quite accurate at judging short-term exhaustion and when I'll recover. And I absolutely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">love Garmin's training load focus</a> for helping me judge when to do low aerobic or anaerobic runs; the only downside is how Garmin doesn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">split a run's training effect into all three categories</a>, tending to lump most of it into one slot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mdn8FC6AyoKBhqF4GxSV2b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-impact-load-summary" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 sitting on an armrest showing the impact load graph for a track workout compared to the actual mileage, with some portions generating double the impact." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdn8FC6AyoKBhqF4GxSV2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 970 builds on the cardiovascular foundation of past watches with running tolerance and impact load. Your body's biomechanical strain on muscles and joints differs from your cardiovascular fatigue, but past models couldn't track that.</p><p>How well do they work? I already wrote earlier this month about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">useful and accurate running tolerance is</a>! The Forerunner 970 correctly judges when long runs put too much impact load on my body past its tolerance. I ignored the data the first time and ended up hurting myself; now I'm back on the cusp of my body's limit, and I'm being more cautious.</p><p>After every run, it calculates the impact load based on factors like your cadence, the elevation change, and intensity. I've found that Garmin's estimate has always correctly judged the relative impact load — like recognizing that a blistering two-mile track workout might cause as much strain as a normal four-mile run — across this past month of training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only new feature that I find a little suspect is the race predictor tool (shown above) that guesses how fast I'll be able to run a race weeks from now at my current training pace. Garmin's race predictions have always been <em>optimistic</em>, but that half-marathon time feels like wishful thinking for me at my current level.</p><p>Otherwise, the Garmin Forerunner 970 gives me a comprehensive and accurate measure of my overall fitness level and the specific impact of each run. It will overwhelm someone who isn't prepared to dive into menus to find all of this data, but Garmin veterans will love the 970 simply for training load focus, weekly mileage tolerance, and the brighter display.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And before you ask, no, I'm not proud of it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="W27uGgUfhsaeEQHZiot3Jd" name="Otterbox-Detailing-Kit-Before-1" alt="The bottom of my dad's iPhone 14 Pro before using the Otterbox Mobile Device Care Kit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W27uGgUfhsaeEQHZiot3Jd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E4UF69p67dWduk58nNL7yd" name="Otterbox-Detailing-Kit-Before-3" alt="The camera bump of my dad's iPhone 14 Pro before using the Otterbox Mobile Device Care Kit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4UF69p67dWduk58nNL7yd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="umos3geDrnBDpaGpK9oJcd" name="Otterbox-Detailing-Kit-Before-2" alt="The dirty MagSafe ring on my dad's iPhone 14 Pro before using the Otterbox Mobile Device Care Kit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/umos3geDrnBDpaGpK9oJcd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I don't really know how a phone gets <em>this</em> dirty, but since I keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">my favorite Android phones</a> in good shape, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro</a> would be the toughest challenge for the Mobile Device Care Kit.</p><p>It comes with three screen and port brushes of various sizes, and I needed all of them to get this phone cleaned. I used the pointy ones to clean the speaker grills, with the larger brush helping wipe away all the dirt and debris that was freed up. I also wasn't afraid to flip the brushes around, using the hard plastic edges to release gunk stuck in there.</p><p>Before starting, I thought the ports and speaker grills trapped the most debris, until I got to the camera bump. The protruding lenses just trap everything, and I'm both stunned and very grossed out about how much came out from them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LMhQsjWhWDgSgvoZVSiqe" name="Otterbox-Detailing-Kit-During-1" alt="Testing the Otterbox Mobile Device Care Kit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LMhQsjWhWDgSgvoZVSiqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I couldn't believe how much gunk was hidden in this iPhone's camera housing.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The detailing kit also comes with a microfiber cloth and nine alcohol wipes which came in handy later.

You can avoid it.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech</p></div></div><p>I hate having to write about this, but I hate scammers and their filthy tricks even more. While they're always out there looking for a victim, big pre-planned sales like Prime Day bring them out of the woodwork. Flies, manure, and all that.</p><p>What you need to know is how they operate and the easy-to-spot tricks they will try to pull. Everyone can get scammed or robbed, but people who aren't paying attention are the best targets because the easy methods often work; besides being crooks, scammers are usually lazy too, and will look for the easy way every time.</p><p>That means it's pretty easy to avoid most of the garbage with a healthy level of paranoia.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-phishing-and-what-to-look-for"><span>Phishing and what to look for</span></h2><p>When millions of packages are on their way to millions of people, scammers know it's a great time to trick you into handing over your information. Be wary of any messages you get about the things you bought or are looking to buy, or from an online retailer about your account.</p><p>The first thing to do is check who it's coming from. If an email says it's from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1044329426159419900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&article_name=I%20hunt%20tech%20deals%20for%20a%20living%2C%20and%20these%20are%20the%2030%20items%20on%20my%20Black%20Friday%20wish%20list&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fbest-black-friday-tech-deals-30-picks-2023" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4793154559124295172-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, but it came from some random bullsh*t place like <em>backup-mailer.com</em>, <strong>it's fake</strong>. Best Buy emails come from bestbuy.com, Amazon emails come from amazon.com, eBay emails come from ebay.com, etc.</p><p>Also, look at <em>why</em> the message says you need to take action. It's easy to grab a few images and forge an email, but a scammer doesn't know what you bought or when you bought it. The same goes for delivery companies — UPS might need to send you an email about a package it has to deliver to you. If they do and it's legit, it will be for something you actually ordered from a website you actually used and will be from UPS's actual website, not some random place.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:452px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.64%;"><img id="hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb" name="Phishing-email-Amazon-Prime-Day.png" alt="Phishing email example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="452" height="482" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An example of a phishing email regarding an Amazon account. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Check Point)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also typically need to create an account to make a purchase from an online retailer. That means scammers know you probably have an Amazon or eBay account, and it's common to see a fake email that sends you to a fake website that looks just like the real thing, where it asks you to sign in.</p><p>Once a thief has your username and password, they'll order stuff that ships quickly using your real payment method. They get free stuff, and you get to try and fix the mess — it's a lot easier to look closely at a message and be sure it's legit.</p><p>Remember — never trust a message unless you know who it came from. Retailers like Walmart or Amazon have their own infrastructure and won't farm out a company that uses a goofy web domain to provide customer service.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-your-credit-card-number-is-the-same-as-cash"><span>Your credit card number is the same as cash</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ" name="Google-Wallet-logo-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="The Google Wallet logo on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, you find a great deal from a website that's not a household name.

I'm always on the lookout for a great deal, but supporting people without a billion dollars in the bank is important to me, too.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can't really trust the people behind a website to have good security in place, and sometimes, you can't trust the people running a website at all. Credit card numbers are literally money, and they're far too easy to steal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="JoU2yjBZDQYrpHc7LhiRU4" name="google-pay-klarna-integration-announced-hero" alt="Klarna announces Google Pay integration for more Buy Now, Pay Later options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JoU2yjBZDQYrpHc7LhiRU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="793" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Klarna)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple of ways to prevent this, and the easiest way is built right into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. If a website gives you the option to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> Pay or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay">Google Pay</a>, use it every time you buy something. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-pay-adds-klarna-expands-buy-now-pay-later-checkout-options">Klarna recently announced Google Pay integration</a>, so you can use your virtual card to pay later for things, which is great.</p><p>PayPal is another option that hides your credit card number, and many online retailers, big and small, accept it. I know many people don't like PayPal for one reason or another, but it is an option, and it will keep some ne'er-do-well from getting your card number and security code.</p><p>It is also worth checking if your card provider offers the option to use a virtual card. These links directly to your account, but they use a randomly generated number and special software to authorize purchases and are pretty foolproof.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sellers-can-be-scammers"><span>Sellers can be scammers </span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.26%;"><img id="smpwZiSohjS3rGqANissxc" name="fake-reviews.png" alt="Real versus fake reviews" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/smpwZiSohjS3rGqANissxc.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="374" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ReviewMeta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but a lot of products you see at online retailers (Amazon in particular) are from sellers that really shouldn't be allowed to be there.</p><p>These aren't first-party sellers. For example, you can buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> on Amazon from Samsung, Amazon itself, or someone else who might not be as trustworthy. Always buy from a name you know and trust whenever you can. That goes for lower-priced items like cables or phone cases as much or more than big-ticket items like a phone or a laptop.</p><p>Third-party sellers who aren't legit do two things to try to trick you. First, they will assemble a lot of fake reviews that simply give a high star rating or use a few short words like "Great!" or "Good seller!" to make you feel more trusting. It doesn't take a lot of fake reviews to drive the rating up, even if there are some more legit and worse reviews posted. Always take a peek through the product reviews before you click to see what you're looking at and who is selling it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.25%;"><img id="nRwBaEKtxS48iJQ7zaCZ34" name="amazon-fake-review-data-breach_0.png" alt="Amazon Fake Review Data Breach" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRwBaEKtxS48iJQ7zaCZ34.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: SafetyDetectives)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, it's also easy to farm fake reviews by offering to give away products to anyone with a webcam and a willingness to lie for free junk. These are harder to spot, but they often don't read like they're very genuine, because they're not.</p><p>Another trick is to slowly increase the price in the weeks and months leading up to the Prime Day, allowing them to offer a bigger percentage off and claim it as a deal. If a product usually sells for $10, getting it for $8 is a nice deal. If the price is increased so that the $10 product is listed for $18, it looks like a super deal when it's listed at $8.</p><p>Use services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">ReviewMeta</a> to help you make better shopping decisions!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-packages-are-like-a-magnet-for-thieves"><span>Packages are like a magnet for thieves</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RQpGTQYVT5MhWvzB9dT6fS" name="google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-linen-button-push-alt.jpg" alt="Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 2nd-gen) Linen button push lifestyle alt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQpGTQYVT5MhWvzB9dT6fS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago, I had a visit from a Porch Pirate, and I was mad as hell about it. What they stole — it was a bag of cactus potting soil — wasn't important, but it was <em>my</em> cactus dirt. I hope their plants choked on it.</p><p>To fix the problem, I bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FYale-Smart-Delivery-Box-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0876XGP3Q%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1226465198452524678-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Yale Smart Delivery Box</a>. It's a large bin with a smart lock, and the delivery person drops off my items in it, where they stay safe until I retrieve them. Maybe cactus dirt doesn't need high-tech protection, but some other things we order do.</p><p>You probably don't need to buy a big box to protect your packages because you live close to a locker of some sort. You can find an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-amazon-locker">Amazon Locker</a> in most places, and UPS has them, too. You can also have your packages held for pickup at the post office or delivery company, or have them sent somewhere like The UPS Store. The packages stay safe and out of the weather, so you can pick them up when you have the time.</p><p>If you live out in the sticks as I do — at the time, the closest locker was about 30 miles away — you should invest in your own smart locker if you buy a lot of stuff online. Thieves are especially interested in porch boxes this time of year.</p><p>Another great way to deter package theft is with a smart camera. Something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hello-doorbell-can-now-tell-you-when-package-has-been-left-your-doorstep">Nest Doorbell</a> is conspicuous and will capture a person trying to steal your stuff. Thieves know this and will often skip houses with a big video camera or doorbell pointing at them.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ai-makes-it-too-easy-to-steal-from-you"><span>AI makes it too easy to steal from you</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB" name="Google-ai-server.jpg" alt="Google Tensor server backdrop on stage at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google, Meta, OpenAI, and all the rest have made it a lot easier to steal from you by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/of-course-gemini-is-being-used-for-crimes">using AI to do it</a>. There is nothing anyone can do about that; when you make technology "smarter," people will find a way to use it to hurt other people.</p><p>AI can do everything I've talked about here.

It's actually <em>really</em> good at it because those details are unique and stand out.</p><p>AI can even be used to track the movement of packages, so someone knows when that big boxy Amazon truck is in your neighborhood.</p><p>Worst of all, AI makes it easier to do this if someone is willing to figure out how to ask the right things.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1178px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.71%;"><img id="8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF" name="imagen-3.jpg" alt="Imagen 3 announcement at I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8gFgHHmJAkD6peyw3u6xxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1178" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI goes a step further, though.

If I can do it, that means people smarter and more crooked than I can do it even better, and they are. With enough time and effort, you can get a phone call or a message from the right person, originating from the right place, asking for just about anything.</p><p>You <strong>can</strong> avoid this. If I were to get a message from my wife asking for a card number or a password, instead of answering it, I'd pick up the phone and call her. Only after knowing that I was talking to my wife would I entertain the idea of sharing my information.</p><p>The same goes for a shipping company like UPS or an online retailer. <strong>Never</strong> click a shortened URL link that can go anywhere, even if you're sure it's legit. Pick up the phone and call a real customer service number. I know everyone hates talking on the phone but it just might save your ass.</p><p>Now go on and spend more than you can afford on things you didn't really need anyway. Just be a little wiser and less trusting because it's that time of year again</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a time to raise awareness about the causes of preventable injuries and highlight ways to stay safe. In 2025, technology is a key part of that. The best Android phones have built-in tools and features for personal safety, including some you may not know about.</p><p>Most people looking for a flagship Android phone will probably be choosing between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, the Google Pixel 9 lineup, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>. Each of these devices has its own personal safety features, plus the default options built into Android. Depending on which phone you choose, you'll get a different set of personal safety features.</p><p>In light of National Safety Month, we're going to highlight the personal safety suites available on each of these popular phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-backs-all-colors-05" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 series does include a respectable set of personal safety features, the story of this lineup is untapped potential. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-series-could-borrow-this-safety-feature-from-apple-and-google">has a car crash detection sensor that is currently unused</a>, and a satellite connectivity feature that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-supports-satellite-connectivity-but-theres-a-catch">left up to carriers rather than being universal</a>.</p><p>The smartphones do have an Emergency SOS feature that can be used to get help in an emergency. Once you've set it up, clicking the Galaxy S25's power button three or four times will initiate Emergency SOS. This will send an SOS message with your location in both address and map form to your emergency contacts.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> adds a unique capability to the standard Emergency SOS feature. You can optionally set Emergency SOS to automatically capture a photo with the front and rear cameras. Another toggle lets your phone send and record a five-second audio clip as well. This could help give your emergency contacts and first responders crucial context for your situation.</p><p>Aside from Emergency SOS, your Galaxy S25 will also support medical info viewable from the lock screen and wireless emergency alerts. It'll also use satellite connectivity if you have Verizon service.</p><p>You can view all of the available options by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigating to <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>. From there, you can set up Emergency SOS, medical info, and more.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6e93792c-820d-4d9e-84d3-99b5d0c338c9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a4f5rfEmrjTaKHrSuXcCg4.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Icyblue official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A decent pick for safety</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 gives you access to core Android safety features, and also supports satellite connectivity if you are on the right network.

The company recently took to X to confirm that the device will show up with a 50MP periscope lens. Nothing said that the camera is "built for creators," and while the camera's optical zoom capability also remains under wraps, the company shared a couple of photos that were taken using said lens, marketing the phone in the usual "Nothing" style.</p><p>That said, while the London-based company was dropping crumbs, a new leak pretty much showed us what the entire cake looked like. The leak suggests that Nothing Phone 3 will have three 50MP cameras, and that the camera placement on the Nothing Phone 3 will be unique. The top camera is off to the side, and the other two lenses are placed at the bottom next to each other.</p><p>The phone may have a 6.7-inch OLED display and be available in black and white colors. As for the device's battery, it is rumored to have a massive 5,150mAh capacity, and the glyph matrix interface on the rear panel.</p><p>The launch will take place on July 1.</p><h2 id="google-s-xr-glasses-might-have-a-unique-name-2">Google's XR Glasses might have a unique name</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/googles-android-xr-glasses-are-reportedly-code-named-google-martha"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Google's XR Glasses were the talk of the town after their appearance at Google I/O this year.

The new table lamp in particular is interesting; it has the usual lighting effects and high degree of customizability that you get with any Govee lighting product, and it also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker.</p><p>Govee collaborated with JBL over the product, and its official name signifies the same: Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL. I'm just going to call it the Table Lamp 2 Pro, and it certainly ticks all the right boxes: it houses 210 RGB LEDs that can be easily controller by your phone, and there's a 2.5-inch JBL full-range driver that sounds good in its own right.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LevLrEN47Wenas7htKvKw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LevLrEN47Wenas7htKvKw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also get a 5,200mAh battery, making the table lamp inherently portable. It is on the bulkier side, but the addition of a battery makes it that much more versatile. The Table Lamp 2 Pro<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Music-Light-Matter-Customized-Living/dp/B0F3D8RB4H"> retails for $179</a>, and you can get two units and set up a stereo pair if you're interested.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CSTiHxQzTyDRCctJbEJpw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSTiHxQzTyDRCctJbEJpw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's clearly a lot going on here, so let's start with the design. The table lamp has an acrylic shell that diffuses light evenly, and the bottom quarter has a clear finish that accentuates the design. You get a set of controls at the top that let you power the device on or off, switch between lighting modes, and change the music playback and volume of the built-in speaker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k4eivHJqxhGmG9U74YBMw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The speaker grille is also located up top, and it's easy enough to connect the table lamp to your phone if you just want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker. On that note, the sound quality is quite good; you get a good mid-range and decent treble, but it misses out on low-end energy — it just doesn't deliver the kind of rumble and vibrancy that you normally get on most portable speakers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rhDKGAshkzHMLNq4RfYQx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's some mid-bass, but you don't get any sub-bass extension. This is likely to do with the design as there isn't much room to house the acoustic cavity, so if you want a Bluetooth speaker that has engaging bass, this isn't the best choice. Thankfully, there's no distortion when you increase the volume, so that's good to see.

Outside of that quibble, there are no downsides here; the LEDs get bright enough that I didn't have to set it to over 50% most of the time, and the diffused light is the highlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3" name="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" alt="Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZMF86zrmuCvUXhM8QnWx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is rock-solid; you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker, and the lighting portion connects to your home network (over the 2.4GHz band).

It also means that we&apos;re going to be experiencing a hectic week of sale events across the web, with all of your favorite websites and influencers alike inundating you with dozens of deals on everything from kitchen appliances to smartphones.</p><p>I&apos;ve been working sale events like this long enough that I know exactly how to breeze through the week of Prime Day with relatively little stress.

Do your research</h2><p>This one might be a bit obvious, but if you plan to make a major purchase during Prime Day, it&apos;s important to do a little research beforehand so you know what you&apos;re looking for. Simply shopping for "any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>" during the sale, for instance, could lead to buyer&apos;s remorse when you realize that you didn&apos;t read up on these devices before making a purchase. </p><p>Start by considering what&apos;s important to <em>you </em>personally when you use your devices. Do you just need something simple and affordable? Maybe great cameras or battery life? What about AI features or long software support? Reading up on the best Android tech beforehand is a great way to make sure you&apos;re prepared when the big sale goes live. </p><p>Start shopping on July 8th with a wish list of the items you&apos;re interested in. That&apos;ll keep you from feeling overwhelmed and ensure you feel confident in your purchase once that order confirmation page appears. After all, tech can be expensive, and every penny counts these days. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-2-look-at-price-history"><span>Tip #2: Look at price history</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-look-at-price-history-2">2. Look at price history</h2><p>When these major sale events go live, it can be hard to tell if a deal is actually good or if the retailer is just trying to make you <em>think</em> it&apos;s good. Items marked with text like "<em>Lightning Deal" </em>can make you feel a sense of urgency on a discount that isn&apos;t necessarily that special. This is where price tracking tools come in handy. </p><p>Websites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"><strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong></a> let you check the complete price history on items sold through Amazon. Pasting the product page URL into the site&apos;s search field will give you a timeline of every instance that the item has been discounted, plus it will tell if you the current discount is record-breaking or if we&apos;ve seen it before. This can be helpful if you&apos;re trying to decide between making a major purchase today or waiting a few more months to buy.</p><p>The problem with websites like Camelcamelcamel is that the data can be a bit unreliable if a product has a lot of different color variants or storage configurations. Information can also be disrupted if the item has too many third-party sellers. Still, I wouldn&apos;t make any purchase on Amazon without at least attempting to check the price history first. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-3-check-rival-sales"><span>Tip #3: Check rival sales</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3" name="prime-day-2023-amazon-ad-169.jpg" alt="Prime Day 2023 ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kowZWDXxMbtmxrruqre7Y3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1092" height="615" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-check-rival-sales-2">3. Check rival sales</h2><p>Of course, whenever Amazon launches a Prime Day event, you can expect most of its competitors to launch rival sales around the same time. Many of these sales match or beat Amazon&apos;s prices, which can be great if you don&apos;t have a Prime membership and aren&apos;t interested in joining (even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>there&apos;s a 30-day trial</strong></a> that lets you shop the sale for free). </p><p>Before you buy an Android device from Amazon during Prime Day, see if Best Buy or Walmart is offering an equal or better deal. Don&apos;t forget to check for extra perks too. Buying a tablet from Amazon may get you the device alone, but purchasing the same tablet for the same price during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-takes-on-amazon-with-an-epic-sale-of-its-own-see-the-top-5-android-deals-that-actually-matter">Best Buy&apos;s sale</a> might also get you three free months of Apple Music or a free trial to Xbox Game Pass. </p><p>Retailers like Best Buy and Samsung may also offer enhanced trade-in credit during their respective sale events, which could land you some additional savings if you have an old or broken device lying around. Needless to say, we&apos;ll be covering all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">best Android deals</a> from across the web that week — regardless of the source — so you can always check with us if you&apos;re unsure about a discount.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-4-watch-out-for-scams"><span>Tip #4: Watch out for scams</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:627px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.09%;"><img id="oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF" name="amazon-scam-detail.png" alt="An example of a scam text sent by a phony USPS rep" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oeCPLS4FcxuTWiGikoxpFF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="627" height="220" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="4-watch-out-for-scams-2">4. Watch out for scams</h2><p>Although Prime Day presents itself as the perfect opportunity to find great deals this summer, it&apos;s also an opportunity for scammers to target your data and bank account. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-prime-day-scams-to-look-for">Reports of scams and phishing attempts</a> increase dramatically during the sale event, and it&apos;s easy to fall victim to these traps if you&apos;re not careful.</p><p>Watch out for emails or texts that are trying to compel you to click on a link concerning a recent purchase, especially if you haven&apos;t placed an order lately. These scammers will often try to impersonate Amazon representatives or mail providers and will send emails from suspicious sources like "amazonusa[.]shop" or "amazonindo[.]com". Other dishonest agents may attempt to contact you by phone. </p><p>Rule of thumb, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4YFYCCNUSENA23B"><strong>Amazon clearly expresses</strong></a> on its site, representatives <em>"will never send you an unsolicited message that asks you to provide sensitive personal information like your social insurance number, tax ID, bank account number, credit card information, ID questions like your mother&apos;s maiden name or your password".</em> </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tip-5-stay-calm"><span>Tip #5: Stay calm</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 5" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="5-stay-calm-2">5. Stay calm</h2><p>Last but not least, if you want to have a good time shopping this Prime Day, it&apos;s important to stay calm. Email newsletters, search engines, and even celebrities will be flooding the airwaves that week with breathless endorsements and recommendations for top products, and it&apos;s important to remember that it&apos;s <em>just a sale</em>. </p><p>Don&apos;t get carried away by a false sense of urgency and buy a bunch of items you don&apos;t need, and don&apos;t get so overwhelmed by the flood of information that you end up missing a truly great deal. By simply researching products beforehand and preparing a list of everything you need in advance, you can wake up on the morning of July 8th and shop for deals at your leisure. </p><p>And don&apos;t forget: the entire Android Central staff (including yours truly) will be around to share our favorite deals and provide helpful shopping advice during the sale, so you&apos;ll never feel too lost. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th-11th: see best early deals and FAQ</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The splash page detailed a "Try a lock screen clock that fits to your photos" feature addition. When scrolling through the new additions in more detail, Samsung's video clip shows how the lock screen clock will morph around items in your chosen photo.</p><p>From the tipster's clip, the clock can recognize and shift around a person's head or other items in your photo for a more modern, artistic approach to your lock screen. In the beta, Samsung itself says this new clock function "works with people and animals."</p><p>This lock screen change grants the clock its own unique font when morphing. Depending on the angle or slant/curve in a photo, the clock will elongate or increase its size to fit perfectly alongside it. The publication also cites prominent tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1938416143670382976">Ice Universe</a>, who spotted one important aspect: this stylistic change only works when the lock screen is fully active.</p><p>When using Samsung's AOD (always-on display), the morphing aspects of the clock remain neutral; however, when the lock screen is fully awakened, it will shift around the photo, as expected.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-has-a-lot-on-the-way-2">One UI 8 has a lot on the way</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New lock screen customization feature (One UI 8 BYFB) pic.twitter.com/vDuPitpec6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1938257024069865840">June 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>One UI 8 finally hit the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">at the end of May</a>. The initial beta packed a ton of upgrades to what users found in One UI 7. Already, the beta showcased improvements for the Now Bar and Now Brief, bringing more customized insights and suggests for daily tasks. Auracast is picking up audio connection via QR code scanning. Additionally, in One UI 8's beta, users can sync with multiple Auracast devices.</p><p>A couple of more apps like the Reminders app and the Calendar picked up updates, as well.</p><p>On a related note, Samsung's Gallery app was spotted with a new feature: "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-get-you-a-secret-vault-for-your-photos-in-one-ui-8">Private Album</a>." Designed to keep your sensitive photos and videos away from prying eyes, this feature had led speculation to believe its a "simpler" version of Samsung's Secure Folder, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">might also get an upgrade</a>. This one would be specifically dedicated to your photos and videos without having to set up Secure Folder just to see that content. This is expected to arrive alongside One UI 8.</p><p>It's unclear when One UI 8 (Android 16) will hit Samsung's devices, though there are rumors that its next foldable will debut with the software (with the stable release alongside it).</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, Google states it's addressing an prominent issue users have voiced in feedback reports about how "slow" Ask Photos is at returning results. However, this seems to be restricted to the AI's ability to fulfill queries about general/broad things like "beaches" and "dogs," per Google.</p><p>The update beginning to rollout this week should make Ask Photos a lot faster at returning answers, but the AI won't stop there.</p><p>Google says "You’ll now see results right away" when asking about broader topics you may have in your gallery. Gemini will keep working behind-the-scenes to "find the most relevant photos or information." From the post's example, it seems that Ask Photos will immediately fulfill your query with a grid view of images that correlate to your interest.</p><p>Above that will be a smooth Gemini animation of it looking through your photos before delivering the "Best Results" that it think matches your search.</p><h2 id="ask-gemini-photos-2">Ask (Gemini) Photos</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.73%;"><img id="hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj" name="google-photos-ask-photos-quicker-answers" alt="Google Photos is boosting Ask Photos with quicker response times for broad/simple queries, while Gemini works in the background for more a more detailed/specific response." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEitAw9AxBy2uN9FNChNKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="537" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Joining this update is a wider rollout of Ask Photos in Google Photos.

Throughout its testing, Gemini has remained at the center of the feature to help users discover content you have via your text query. Gemini was given the ability to understand queries based on people, food, and places but, as we've seen from reported user feedback, the AI can take a little longer than some would like.</p><p>Now, fulfilling these requests should come a lot faster for users just looking for a wide range of what they have.</p><p>Ask Photos also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ask-photos-ui-search-redesign-rollout">underwent a slight UI rework</a> earlier this year. Google cleaned up the chat interface, leading off with a "try asking" section full of suggested actions. It's also this UI that'll be flooded with your photos as Gemini tries to find what you're looking for, alongside its text reply of the content it found for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/2025-summer-launch-event">save $30</a> by subscribing to OnePlus's newsletter, so assuming the price hasn't changed, you must choose whether $319 for the best experience or $179 for the Watch 2R fits your budget.</p><p>Even though the Watch 3 43mm will be technically better, the Watch 2R doesn't feel like a compromise compared to <em>other</em> brands. It's due to receive Wear OS 5 soon, and most likely Gemini with it, so the software will still feel fresh. And it'll spare you the headache of frequent charging you get with most smartwatches.</p><h2 id="oneplus-watch-2r-alternatives-2">OnePlus Watch 2R alternatives</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-apps.jpeg" alt="The apps drawer on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a good alternative right now at $199.

It'll depend on which type of Android phone you have: Samsung watches have a lot of exclusive features requiring Galaxy phones, while the Watch 2R works seamlessly on any Android brand.</p><p>You can also go even cheaper with a Galaxy Watch FE or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, both majorly discounted right now on Amazon. Of the two, the Pro 5 has comparable performance, display quality, and battery life, but Mobvoi's slow updates and lack of Google Assistant make it a little harder to recommend. And Samsung's Fan Edition hardware is too outdated, in my opinion. Look at your options, but consider the Watch 2R first.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">made this same upgrade</a> with the Galaxy S24 family and kept the same 480Hz rate on the Galaxy S25 family.</p><p>However, Android Authority reports that they've only found hints that Google will be upgrading the Pro lineup, not the baseline Pixel 10. Not only that, but 480Hz doesn't come close to resolving the issue some users have with PWM dimming, as it still fails to meet basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/ssl-miller-lehman_flicker_lightfair2015.pdf">IEEE flicker standards</a>. For that, Google would have to use at least 1920Hz PWM dimming, while competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> use 4320Hz PWM dimming.</p><h2 id="some-signs-of-hope-2">(Some) signs of hope</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VwNNCjoCRXqwjC9eZsGviS" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-vs-Vivo-X100-Pro-display-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the fast, low modulation PWM rate of the Vivo X100 Pro (left) with the slow, high modulation PWM rate of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwNNCjoCRXqwjC9eZsGviS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Back in April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google told me</a> that it was "aware and investigating this" issue and that "you can expect updates later this year." Presumably, that meant the Pixel 10 series, and it looks like all signs point to some improvements coming down the pike.</p><p>When I spoke to Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman about the code found that hints at PWM dimming improvements, it seemed that Google might have an additional accessibility setting that further improves the PWM rate for users "with sensitive eyes," as the setting is named.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> already include accessibility settings for users with flicker sensitivity, so there's no reason Google can't do the same. This way, it could have the best of both worlds, providing excellent displays on Pixels while allowing them to be more eye-friendly.</p><div><blockquote><p>My hope is that the rumored accessibility setting for sensitive eyes allows users to further upgrade this dimming rate, because 480Hz just isn't fast enough to help the problem.</p></blockquote></div><p>I know Google can ramp up the PWM dimming rate to 10x the current rate and well beyond, as I proved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">when I upgraded the Pixel 8 Pro's PWM dimming</a> rate to 4800Hz. Google often uses lower PWM rates because it can ensure the brightest displays on the market, but users like me care a lot more about the headaches these displays cause than the brightness level.</p><h2 id="i-want-to-use-pixels-again-2">I want to use Pixels again</h2><p>My hope is that Google brings the base PWM rate up for all users and offers a way for sensitive users like me to further ramp up the PWM dimming frequency. As it stands, I cannot use Pixel phones as my daily driver anymore because their incredibly bright displays flicker at too slow a rate and give me eye pain and headaches.</p><p>Otherwise, I'll have to wait at least another year until Google is able to further upgrade its displays to be friendlier to anyone with flicker sensitivity. Either way, we'll find out quite soon as we expect Google to announce the Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">in the next few weeks</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They also do an excellent job with ANC, with the mode tuning out ambient noise like the hum of an AC, traffic sounds, or a jet engine.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't like buds with a snug fit, and you need a case with Qi charging.</p><p>Weighing just 4.8g, the Air 5 Pro are one of the lightest earbuds around, and the contoured design of the shell means you get a secure fit without any issues. I didn't notice any problems in this regard in the month I used the earbuds, and you're not trading in battery life either — these buds manage to last seven hours on a full charge with the noise-isolating mode engaged.</p><p>They don't miss out on the basics; they use Qualcomm's QCC3091 Bluetooth 5.4 modem, and you get dual device connectivity as standard. The 6-mic array does a good job with calls in general, and they get IPX5 ingress protection, making the buds a good choice for workouts.</p><p>High-resolution audio is a clear area of differentiation, and these buds get AptX, AptX Adaptive, and AptX Lossless codecs as part of the Snapdragon Sound.

In the past, the Galaxy Watch 5 cost $30 more than the Watch 4, while the Watch 6 cost $20 more than the Watch 5. Price inflation isn't uncommon in this lineup.</p><p>The leaked info also suggests that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will cost "just under €500," about a €50 jump over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> 47mm. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025)</a> is said to have an unchanged price tag of €699, or $649 in the U.S.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/these-leaked-renders-are-your-best-look-yet-at-the-galaxy-watch-8-series">Leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy Watch 8 series in recent weeks have shown a significant redesign for the series, with a more square-shaped case across the lineup. But this report seems to suggest the case sizing will remain the same as last year, and that the Watch 8 will have doubled storage (64GB). Other specs remain a mystery, for now.</p><h2 id="why-a-galaxy-watch-8-price-increase-seems-likely-2">Why a Galaxy Watch 8 price increase seems likely</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This report doesn't <em>confirm</em> that the Watch 8 will get a price increase, but it seems likely given the current economic climate.

If the Watch 8 Classic costs about $450–500, the jump to $650 for the Ultra might look less onerous to some buyers than it did from $300.</p><p>Samsung may also try to append a Samsung Health subscription on top of the Galaxy Watch 8; a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-explores-possible-galaxy-watch-fitness-subscription-report">Samsung senior VP of health said</a> last week that it was "exploring" putting "advanced coaching features" behind a premium paywall. This may not happen anytime soon, but it'll make Samsung Health more like Fitbit Premium or Apple Fitness Plus.</p><p>Ultimately, Samsung knows that the Galaxy Watch 8 will still cost less than the $399 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, despite this alleged price hike.

If the chat you're in has an excess of unread messages, WhatsApp states there will be a banner at the start of those texts. Users can tap this banner to activate Meta AI's summarization capabilities.</p><p>WhatsApp says that neither it nor Meta will ever know what those messages were, nor will they know what the AI summarized. Additionally, on you're aware of that summary (no one else will know that you didn't read their texts individually).</p><p>It seems that the service's summaries will deliver its information in a bullet point format. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> will seemingly do its best to list as many key points as possible, even calling people out by name, so you have as much to go on as possible.</p><p>This feature is rolling out for English users in the U.S. this week.

It focused on enhancing the business experience, so those users could do so with less resistance. To help, WhatsApp rolled out "Ads in Status" as a way to help small or large businesses grow and reach new people more easily.</p><p>WhatsApp also added "Promoted Channels."

The post states this new carousel will contain suggested "videos and topic descriptions" based on your query. It's also good to note that not every query will return this AI-powered highlight (kind of like something more Google-related).</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6COYibrEk54?feature=share">its Short</a>, YouTube states Premium users need only pose a query to the platform, like "best beaches in Hawaii."</p><p>The carousel will be marked by Google's classic AI star with "Highlights" as its title. Beneath that, users will find a highlighted video clip, as well as several subsequent video thumbnails that will help enhance the information. Users can tap on these thumbnails to see a short clip play; however, tapping the clips opens the video in full on that creator's channel.</p><p>More than that, every clip is given its own AI-generated title and description. These <em>should </em>be relevant to your query, with YouTube stating these descriptions will "show how it matches your search." Ideally, these text boxes should hold useful insights about places you're interested in seeing or products. It's a good rule of thumb to remember that features like this can slip up at times, so be wary of that.</p><h2 id="youtube-gets-some-ai-lovin-2">YouTube gets some AI lovin'</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6COYibrEk54" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>YouTube adds that this AI search results carousel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">is running from today</a> (June 26) to July 30 for Premium users. However, you'll only be able to try this out on your Android or iOS mobile device.</p><p>The platform also highlighted that it's expanding its conversational AI test to some non-Premium users in the U.S.</p><p>Setting that aside for now, YouTube's AI search results carousel is highly reminiscent of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews</a>. Each is designed to give quick, bite-sized information to users depending on the query, as the AI can't fulfill everything with an overview. On one hand, it seems like a no-brainer that Google would bring some of its AI into YouTube, like AI Overviews. Either way, YouTube's been going down this AI road for a while now, slowly but surely.</p><p>That <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">conversational AI test</a> for Premium users kicked off late in 2023. YouTube placed a new "Ask" button alongside the thumbs up/down buttons under videos. Users would see a few suggested actions, like "Summarize the video," "tell me more about the topic," and "recommend related content." As always, users retain their ability to write their own questions about the video with the AI. YouTube has also started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-premium-100-million-subscriber-celebration">venturing into AI-generated music</a>, too, for Shorts creation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means we're looking ahead to the upcoming Google Pixel 10 lineup, which isn't very far away. Based on rumors, leaks, and past Google launches, we're expecting the Pixel 10 series to debut this summer.</p><p>In fact, we even have an idea of the exact date for the Made by Google event for the Pixel 10 lineup. Android Central meticulously follows all the newest rumors, leaks, and official teasers so you don't have to. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> will launch in late August 2025, slightly later than the Pixel 9 launched in 2024.</p><p>For all the latest details and frequently asked questions about the Google Pixel 10 lineup, keep reading.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-launch-date-what-we-know"><span>Google Pixel 10 launch date: What we know</span></h2><p>Google is expected to hold a Made by Google launch event on August 20, 2025, and this is where we will see the Pixel 10 series for the first time. The actual release date for the Google Pixel 10 will be August 28, per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-release-date" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> leak. The full crop of phones that will be announced on August 20 includes the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Earlier, reports indicated the Made by Google launch event would be held on August 13, 2025. This would’ve been the exact same date that Google launched the Pixel 9 one year earlier. However, newer reports claim that Google opted to push back the Made by Google event one week, giving us the August 20 estimate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hegvUAcXS9QDHfs3VeH6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Keeping with tradition, the Google Pixel 10 will be available for preorder immediately after the event on August 20. Those preorders won’t be available until the official launch date of May 28, and in-store availability is expected to arrive on that same day. Currently, we don’t know what kind of preorder deals or promotions might be offered alongside the Pixel 10 series, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/the-best-google-pixel-9-deals-of-the-month">best Pixel 9 deals</a> might give us some indication of what to expect.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><h2 id="when-will-the-google-pixel-10-launch-2">When will the Google Pixel 10 launch?</h2><p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to launch in August, with retail availability and an official release date rumored for late August. It may arrive slightly later than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel 9 lineup</a> last year, which was announced on August 13, 2024, and officially released on August 22, 2024.</p><p>Last year, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold debuted later than the rest of the Pixel 9 series. It's unclear if the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will also follow this blueprint for the company's 2025 release.</p><p>Please note that any rumored dates are subject to change, as Google has not officially announced the date of its next Made by Google event.</p><h2 id="how-much-will-the-google-pixel-10-cost-2">How much will the Google Pixel 10 cost?</h2><p>While the official prices of the Google Pixel 10 series haven't been released, rumors point to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">some models getting a price change in 2025</a>. Specifically, the Pixel 10 Pro XL could get a $100 price hike, making the list price $1,199. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a $200 price decrease, lowering the cost to $1,599. The base-model Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro might keep their $799 and $999 price points, respectively.</p><h2 id="will-the-google-pixel-9-drop-in-price-2">Will the Google Pixel 9 drop in price?</h2><p>If we look at past Google Pixel launches as precedent, the Pixel 9 series should hang around at lower price points following the Pixel 10 launch. However, you don't need to wait for the Google Pixel 10 to come out to snag a deal on the Pixel 9. Prices are already much lower than they were at launch, for instance.</p><p>The best time to grab a great Pixel 9 deal is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">during Amazon Prime Day</a>, which will span July 8 to 11 this year. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/my-favorite-google-pixel-9-deal-of-all-time-just-got-even-better-but-theres-a-small-problem">We're loving some of these early Prime Day Pixel 9 deals</a>, too.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Pixel 10 news, and check back during Prime Day for the top curated Pixel 9 deals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="922e8ebb-4e6e-4e68-b8c4-26dfd7082689">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>All eyes are on the upcoming Google Pixel 10, but don't sleep on the current Pixel 9.

Google led its email off by saying, "We're updating how Gemini interacts with some of the apps on your Android device." This "update" concerns Gemini's Apps Activity records within your Google account.</p><p>Now, whether you have it enabled or disabled, Gemini will still have access to your chosen Extensions like Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and Utilities.</p><p>This change is set to arrive for Gemini on July 7. As the publication reiterates, Google's purpose behind the Gemini App Activity is to essentially improve its services, as well as the AI, from top to bottom. This includes personalizing Google products (as you'd expect). Your chats with Gemini are only kept for 72 hours, which Google says is enough time to "maintain safety and security" while also handling any feedback.</p><p>Considering Google relied on Gemini's App Activity being enabled, users couldn't use their Extensions without having their interactions catalogued. This is changing come July 7. So, if you'd like to disable Google from keeping hold of your dealings with Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini">you can do that</a> to prepare for this QoL (quality of life) change.</p><h2 id="a-change-that-s-meant-to-help-2">A Change that's meant to Help</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ljp2uk/some_gemini_extensions_wont_require_usage_activity">Some Gemini Extensions Won't Require Usage Activity</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard">r/Bard</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The email Google has started sending out gave some quite a fright, especially when they read that Gemini will have access to their calls and texts, whether their App Activity was on or off. Moreover, Google gave no clear directions about how to disable any of this, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-apps-activity-email-july-7-3570651/">Android Authority</a> notes.</p><p>However, Google quickly cleared that air in an official statement, saying, "This update is good for users: they can now use Gemini to complete daily tasks on their mobile devices like send messages, initiate phone calls, and set timers while Gemini Apps Activity is turned off."</p><p>The company adds, "As always, users can turn off Gemini’s connection to apps at any time." This can be found by heading into Gemini's Settings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/apps">and hitting "Apps."</a> Users can freely toggle off any apps they don't want Gemini having access to that are connected to their Google Account, thus that data becomes unavailable to it.</p><p>While we await this small update, earlier this year, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">a major Gemini app update</a> and a test called "personalization." Back in March, the company gave access to an experimental feature that leveraged an upgraded 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. Gemini could offer a more "tailored" experience by using your history in Search to help you find restaurants based on the food you typically look for.</p><p>Additionally, the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model is roping in even more apps to help users with complex queries that require it to look across multiple apps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone's design is pretty similar to what consumers received last year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivos-latest-foldables-make-the-galaxy-z-fold-5-look-outdated">X Fold 3 and X Fold 3 Pro</a>. Consumers are granted a 6.5-inch cover display, which blossoms into an 8-inch inner screen with 2K resolution. Aside from its thin profile when folded (9.2mm), Vivo's main highlight is its Apple Watch integration.</p><p>What seemed like an improbability, Vivo's X Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/PycvDkEta">fully supports</a> the Apple Watch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/25/vivo-x-fold-5-launch-dust-apple-watch/">9to5Google</a>).</p><h2 id="android-apple-2">Android & Apple</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.36%;"><img id="UucD2Z3v22aCBhAKpXrfUW" name="vivo-x-fold-5-apple-watch-support" alt="Vivo's X Fold 5 fully supports the Apple Watch, MacOS for file transfers and "Extended Screen," and its AirPods." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UucD2Z3v22aCBhAKpXrfUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="534" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This marks the first time an Android device can find "full" connectivity with Apple's iOS device. Vivo states on Weibo that users can pair their Apple Watch with the X Fold 5 to receive texts, answer calls, and find their collected health data from the device in totality. Your health information recorded via the Apple Watch will be available in your Vivo Health app. Additionally, Apple's AirPods also fully work with the X Fold 5.</p><p>As previously teased during MWC Shanghai, the X Fold 5 also receives full MacOS integration, letting users view their computer files at will (if connected), use the "Extended Screen" feature, and drag-and-drop files across apps.</p><h2 id="multitasking-x-fold-5-specs-2">Multitasking & X Fold 5 Specs</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="es4vPTizjsFmPCSSwRqZeY" name="vivo-x-fold-5-white-example" alt="The Vivo X Fold 5 in white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/es4vPTizjsFmPCSSwRqZeY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="599" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.94%;"><img id="42jh2hBpoEsNBwhC7LEWrb" name="vivo-x-fold-5-atomic-workbench" alt="Vivo's "Atomic Workbench" (machine-translated) is a better multitasking experience for the X Fold 5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42jh2hBpoEsNBwhC7LEWrb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="536" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Another standout feature is Vivo's new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/Pyct1oQFD">Big Screen Experience</a>" for the X Fold 5 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/25/vivo-x-fold-5-launch-dust-apple-watch/">9to5Google</a>). Its Weibo post has been machine-translated, which dubs the feature "Atomic Workbench." In short, this is a new multi-tasking mode that can reportedly let users run "up to five applications simultaneously." Users will find file transfer support across these apps via dragging and dropping.</p><p>The rest of the X Fold 5 specs include a triple 50MP camera setup in its circular camera array. This is yet another similarity to the Fold 3. The internal and cover displays offer a 20MP selfie camera. Vivo details its resistances, stating the foldable has received IPX8 and IPX9 ratings for water resistance, as well as IP5X dust resistance.</p><p>Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC powers many of its functions. The X Fold 5 packs the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/512GB, 16/1TB.</p><p>There is one notable improvement with the X Fold 5, and that concerns its upgraded 6,000mAh battery. Vivo complements this with 80W wired fast charging and 40W wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>The Vivo X Fold 5 is out for pre-orders right now for 7,999 Chinese Yuan (~$1,114). Vivo hasn't said anything about a potential global release yet.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
