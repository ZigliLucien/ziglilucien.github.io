                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Although headphone deals aren't particularly hard to find, a quality pair of cans will generally set you back <em>at least</em> $100, even with a discount. Fortunately, an Amazon deal has come along to change all of that. For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank"><strong>you can grab 40% off the price of the JBL Tune 510BT headphones</strong></a>, bringing the price down to just $30.</p><p>These foldable, over-ear Bluetooth headphones are said to offer up to 40 hours of battery life, along with a bass-heavy sound, and a USB-C port for quick charging. While they don't feature as many of the bells and whistles as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, they certainly aren't a bad pick for those on a serious budget.</p><p>While they don't feature active noise cancellation, these JBL headphones do include a built-in microphone for easy compatibility with voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Alexa, or for phone and video calls. It's also worth noting that this particular deal is only available for these headphones in the White and Black colors.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.27%;"><img id="8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX" name="jbl-tune-510bt-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Tune 510BT Headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.95</del> <strong>$29.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is offering these affordable JBL wireless headphones for 40% off the normal price, representing $20 in savings and cutting the price to just $30. While these aren't top-of-the-line headphones by any means, they'll get the job done for most casual users with a built-in microphone, onboard buttons, and a long-lasting, fast-charging battery.</p><p><strong>Price comparison</strong>: <a href="https://www.jbl.com/on-ear-headphones/TUNE510BT-.html" target="_blank">JBL - $29.95</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Tune-510BT-Wireless-on-ear-headphones-Black/250887552" target="_blank">Walmart - $34.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a pair of Bluetooth headphones and having an affordable price tag is your top priority; you like over-ear headphones that can be folded up when not in use for easy storage; you like having a more bass-forward audio profile than one that's more balanced across frequencies.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a pair of over-ear headphones with ANC; you're looking for a pair of premium headphones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jbls-new-earbuds-and-headphones-come-smart-noise-cancellation">JBL 660NCs</a>, and you've got the budget to spend more than $30; you need headphones with higher-quality audio and/or a more balanced sound profile; you like having larger speaker cups.</p><p>While the JBL Tune 510BT is no doubt one of the company's economy-level pairs of headphones, this also an excellent chance to catch a pair for just $30. Even at their normal price point of $60, they seem like a decent offering from JBL with up to 40 hours of battery life per charge, and 2 additional hours of listening per 5-minute charge with the USB-C cable.</p><p>They also include a built-in microphone, physical playback and volume controls, and a folding design that makes them pretty easy to stow and transport.</p><p>These come with the JBL Pure Bass sound, according to the company, though users who don't like this can simply EQ audio toward a more treble-oriented sound using their phone's built-in equalization controls. The speaker cups on these are a bit smaller than those of most premium headphones, which can definitely be a positive for some buyers while being a negative for others.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google's rolling out an update for Gmail that brings a new "Purchases" tab just in time for the holidays.</li><li>This new tab will only display your purchases/orders and tracking information with the "Arriving Soon" section at the top like your inbox.</li><li>Gmail is also updating its Promotions tab, adding a way for users to leverage what's most important and "timely" offers quicker.</li></ul><p>Google's starting to roll out an update for Gmail that might make it easier to manage all those packages this holiday season.</p><p>There are two features on the way in this new update, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/one-stop-purchase-tracking-in-gmail/">Keyword post</a> explains those key details. Arriving in Gmail's sidebar (in app and on PC), users will notice a new "Purchases" email label. Google states tapping Purchases will give you a "bird's eye view of all your upcoming package deliveries in one simple, organized list." From this view, users will find an "Arriving Soon" section at the top, similar to what you'd find in your primary inbox.</p><p>This is reserved for packages that should be delivered within the next 24 hours. Below that, users will find the list of emails containing those tracking details and order confirmation. This update is rolling out today (Sep 11) for all personal Gmail accounts, so keep your eye out for it.</p><p>Additionally, Google says the "Arriving Soon" section in your primary email, as well as tracking details within order emails themselves, will not leave.</p><p>The second update concerns Gmail's "Promotions" tab. This tab will now offer a "nudge," bringing up promotions and discounts that are timely, so you're in the loop. More than that, a new sorting option, "Most Relevant," is on the way, which Google says pushes Gmail to display promotions from brands you're more likely to engage with. Users can sort by "most recent," too, if you're interested in just seeing the emails as they arrive.</p><h2 id="gmail-for-the-holidays-2">Gmail for the holidays</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D" name="gmail-purchases-tracking-tab-update" alt="Gmail's getting a new "Purchases" tab, which highlights every order and purchase made in one convenient place for tracking." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="750" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D" name="gmail-promotions-tab-sorting-update" alt="Google's updating Gmail's Promotion tab with new sorting options to help users see deals that they care for the most." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google, Gmail, and the holidays seem to be a regular thing as of late, as even last year, an update rolled out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">help users avoid scams</a>. The company implemented a new AI model in Gmail in December last year to determine what's a scam and what isn't. Google said its AI models were successful in blocking ~20% more scam attempts and are also reviewing 1,000 times more user-reported spam events.</p><p>These protections are still in place, and Google still encourages users to be vigilant on their own.</p><p>A Gemini update for Gmail arrived this year, making it way easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">take important dates and events from an email</a> and put them into Calendar. If Google's AI detects a date within an email, an "add to calendar" button will appear for convenience. The AI will automatically create an event centered around it, leaving you the choice of further editing that newly created event for clarity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As if it were in a carnival, Apple's iPhone was found by Google Pixel in a batch of chicken feed, with the cuties running around in the background, too. Apple's iPhone wound up explaining that it's not only trying to teach its chickens how to sing, but it's trying to teach turtles how to run a bank, too.</p><p>Google's Pixel found both ambitions familiar, flashing clips of videos generated by Gemini.

Apple Intelligence sort of took a step back, grabbing subtle upgrades over what users already have to play with (though it's still not everything). Apple brought the new Liquid Glass design, Live Translations for audio and text, among others.</p><p>Here's the thing: it's already been a year since Apple debuted its AI intelligence for its iPhone users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">and they still haven't gotten</a> everything promised. In fact, most of those features are <em>still </em>delayed. That setback has pushed things back for likely another year. It's not as though Apple doesn't have its own strong, clear vision of what its AI intelligence should look like—it does. But the delays and problems it's encountering have left some wondering if Apple should just settle with Gemini.</p><p>This #BestPhonesForever series on YouTube by Google is its way of having "fun" with Apple, kind of like when it responded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-teases-apple-iphone-17-pixel-design-copy-rumors">rumors about the iPhone 17's design</a>.

I bought a Galaxy S25 Edge with my own cash and plan to do the same with the iPhone Air, and in this guide, I'll help you figure out how these two smartphones compare.</p><p>For those who don't quite understand the appeal of thin phones, here's a quick overview. There are certainly some people who use every percentage of their phone's battery life each day and all of its features. However, there's also a subset of users that don't need extremely long battery life or a pro-grade camera system. For them, it's arguably better to carry a thin and light phone daily, and add separate tools like a MagSafe/Qi2 battery pack or a dedicated camera when they're really needed.</p><p>If that sounds like you, an iPhone Air or Galaxy S25 Edge might be the change you need. I ditched heavy and thick flagships this year and haven't looked back. But you'll want to pick the right one — here's how to decide.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR" name="iPhone-Air-1" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartphone manufacturers have been cheating on thinness for ages with camera bumps and creative math — there isn't a single brand that includes the thickness of the camera bump in their official measurements, and foldable phones even omit the size of the internal bezel when talking about their unfolded measurements.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone Air</a> takes this practice to the extreme. It doesn't have a camera bump; it has a camera <em>plateau</em>, and it practically houses the entire phone — the rest of the chassis is filled almost entirely with battery. This strategy makes the iPhone Air feel impossibly thin, with much of the body measuring only 5.6mm thick. At the same time, the plateau will protrude further off the back of the phone than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>By comparison, Samsung made the Galaxy S25 Edge measure 5.8mm thick. The difference of 0.2mm in thickness might sound minuscule, but early first impressions from those who have held the Air seem to show it's a difference you can feel, which may be attributed to its curvier chassis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a big difference in screen size and overall form factor between the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The former has a 6.5-inch screen, which slots in between what would typically be a base or a plus-sized phone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display that's identical in size to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>. Both phones are using AMOLED screens with 120Hz LTPO support, but the iPhone is slightly brighter, topping out at 3,000 nits.</p><p>It's worth noting that due to all the components in the iPhone Air camera plateau, Apple had to shift the Dynamic Island and Face ID sensors down to make everything fit. This means the pill-shaped camera cutout will cut deeper into the iPhone Air display, obstructing more of your content. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a hole-punch camera cutout in the display that's much more minimal than what the iPhone Air offers.</p><p>The iPhone Air also has an anti-reflective coating similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Both phones use a titanium construction for durability and feature IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.</p><p>Personally, I'm torn on which phone looks better. To me, the reasonably small rear camera bump is a huge appeal of the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's hard not to be impressed by the 5.6mm thickness of the iPhone Air.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge both impressively retain similar performance to that of their "Pro" and "Ultra" counterparts.

By that logic, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge effectively has <em>three</em> cameras. The Galaxy S25 Edge's main camera is a 200MP sensor that can also provide 2x optical-quality zoom via a technique called sensor cropping. On top of that, the Samsung phone has a 12MP ultrawide camera for wide shots.</p><p>Apple's 18MP front-facing camera on the iPhone Air is impressive. It features a square sensor that enables horizontal and portrait selfies without physically rotating the device. Samsung doesn't have this feature on the Galaxy S25 Edge; its front-facing camera is the usual 4:3 aspect ratio. The 12MP, f/2.2 sensor is still solid and can produce great photos.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-which-should-you-buy-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="saTw9bwX4Ebd6rQegs5e4S" name="iPhone-Air-3" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saTw9bwX4Ebd6rQegs5e4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is downright mind-blowing, and there appear to be fewer compromises than the iPhone Air. Compared to Apple's thin handset, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a flagship processor without binning, a faster USB-C port, stereo speakers, a rear ultrawide camera, a larger display, and a smaller front-facing camera cutout. However, it's slightly thicker and more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>There's just one reason why it's extremely difficult to recommend the Galaxy S25 Edge over the iPhone Air. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">doesn't have Qi2 magnets onboard</a>, and this feels like a mandatory feature for thin phones with shorter battery life. The iPhone Air, having MagSafe and Qi2 support, means you can quickly and easily top up the phone with a battery pack in a pinch. It'll be much tougher to do so on the Galaxy S25 Edge without a case, and adding a case somewhat defeats the point of a thin phone.</p><p>Otherwise, the choice might come down to whether you prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. Neither phone is perfect, but both the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are a breath of fresh air for people disenfranchised by thick, heavy smartphones.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="03e3c250-82a4-4fff-a02c-de01413737ec">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" data-model-name="Apple iPhone Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin above all else</strong></em></p><p>The iPhone Air is for people who want a futuristic-feeling phone with thinness that feels too good to be true.

You have a similar design with a stem style and earbuds with white ear tips and a transparent-looking stem with silver finishes inside.</p><p>The case also looks similar to what we have seen before, with a new silver finish for the bottom and a transparent lid, like previous designs. However, this is where things get interesting.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-case-gets-more-functional-2">Nothing's case gets more functional</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">18th September 📆Nothing ear (3) pic.twitter.com/NvHbWXVQpn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1966140666834202942">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The teaser shows a new "Talk" button right up front in the earbuds' case.

It's unclear what the new "Talk" button does, but we expect it relates to talking to an AI chatbot directly through the earbuds' case.</p><p>Another new detail about the case is that Nothing has used "100% anodised recycled aluminium," which the company says provides improved durability and a premium finish. In addition, the company says it has refined the earbuds’ design by minimizing clearance between components and has also "reengineered the metal antenna to a flat finish and controlled its thickness to just 0.35 mm."</p><p>The company hasn't revealed new features or full specs yet, based on past launches, it's likely we'll see more details ahead of launch. Pricing and availability details are likely to be announced at the official launch on September 18, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While we got to test out Meta Orion at last year's Connect, that pair was never intended to be a product you could walk into a store and buy.</p><p>Meta Hypernova may be called Meta Celeste when it launches later this year, but we'll need to wait for Connect to be sure. Essentially, Meta Celeste can be considered a hybrid between a smartwatch, smartphone, and existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. A small display is said to be in one of the lenses, which can show notifications, turn-by-turn directions, and even some apps.</p><p>The glasses are rumored to ship with Meta's most popular apps preinstalled (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc) and will connect to your phone to sync relevant information. Just like a smartwatch, it should have its own OS, processor, and a unique input system that relies on hand tracking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a gesture bracelet</a> to make virtual interaction feel seamless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG" name="meta-hypernova-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of Meta Hypernova or Meta Celeste smart glasses and the sEMG wristband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1654" height="930" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna (@Lunayian) on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're also expecting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 3</a> to make a debut at Connect, and it seems like Meta is doing something interesting with this release. Instead of three different frame styles with your choice of lenses in each, it's rumored that Meta is making separate sunglasses and prescription glasses frames to widen compatibility with lenses.</p><p>Some users were unable to use Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">they don't support strong prescriptions</a>, something a dedicated pair of prescription Ray-Ban frames would be able to do. Meta should be launching a new version of Meta AI with these Gen 3 Ray-Bans, as well as Meta Hypernova, which allows Meta AI to see the world around you for much longer.</p><p>This would enable Meta AI to give you personalized memory-based responses. For instance, you may be able to ask Meta AI where you left your keys or where it last saw your phone. It's even said that Meta AI will be able to remember people's names and faces with this update.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="btaFpdvbzhfRHsmNotaeKJ" name="ray-ban-meta-3-leak-16x9" alt="Leaked renders of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btaFpdvbzhfRHsmNotaeKJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has a lot of upcoming competition, including a rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazons-secret-ar-glasses-project-codenamed-jayhawk-aims-to-rival-metas-dominance">pair of smartglasses from Amazon</a> and upcoming Android XR-powered smart glasses from Google's partners.

Looking into any Security & Privacy changes unearthed a notification within those settings that might've teased Google's work to pair Identity Check with the Pixel Watch. The company's early code reads, "Identity Check works with your Pixel Watch."</p><p>It adds, "Prevent others from opening your apps that require fingerprint or face unlock. When connected to your Pixel Watch, your security is assured with greater mobility."</p><p>Currently, as Rahman states, it seems this smartwatch integration will let users decide to use their PIN, pattern, or password, removing the necessity of using a Biometric method (fingerprint, face). Of course, this will only work when your watch and phone are within range, making it a little easier to hop into your apps when out in public spaces. Moreover, a discovered string of code seems to suggest this updated Identity Check with Pixel Watch will only support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-one-year-later">Pixel Watch 3</a> and higher (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>).</p><p>Rahman concludes by noting a potential update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-enable-identity-check">Identity Check</a> as a whole, which is spreading its Biometric requirement to even more apps. Additionally, the post states the Android 16 code suggests using your screen lock credentials will no longer be an option.</p><h2 id="keeping-your-data-safe-2">Keeping your data safe</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These changes to Identity Check for Android 16 might make it feel a little more approachable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-could-bring-identity-check-to-more-smartphones">as it's currently not like that</a>.

This must be done when accessing passkeys and passwords, and even changing PINs and interacting with the Find My Device network.</p><p>If/when this arrives, it'll be good to see Google finally letting users choose their PIN or password as an alternative if their supported Pixel Watch is close.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems Google's even preparing to bring Identity Check to more devices.

There's a secondary coil inside the Qi mat that allows you to attach the Apple Watch, and it's just plain cool.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="UNJoxRdwXwc6RaQSRNYYVg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNJoxRdwXwc6RaQSRNYYVg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="9iyeiRdguHVY52SoUAwyVg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9iyeiRdguHVY52SoUAwyVg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4956" height="2792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="D8savCDyiGb9vs4jbijDkg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D8savCDyiGb9vs4jbijDkg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It takes a few tries to understand how to position the Apple Watch on the power bank, but once I figured it out, I didn't see any issues. The power bank itself is on the smaller side as these things go, and at 210g, it isn't all that heavy either. It has a plastic chassis, and build quality is pretty good. The kickstand is quite handy as well, and it lets you use your phone while it's charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SE8djVnN6jnQGJBw2gMk4h" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SE8djVnN6jnQGJBw2gMk4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only caveat when using the Click Trio with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a> is that it's limited to 3W, so it takes a few hours to charge the smartwatch.

The video came with a slogan "Refined.

Some of the icon changes that caught our eye were a circular torch icon with a red light, circular icons for Bluetooth and Dark Mode toggles, new icons for what appear to be temperature control and brightness adjustment widgets, and new icons for a to-do list widget and a pill-shaped switch.</p><p>Furthermore, the company seems to have added a new color to its existing monochromatic red color palette.

To create a satellite SOS that's easy to use—even when you can't use its screen, according to Google's Sharath Ananth—the company had to consider "positioning interface, audio cues, and haptic feedback." Some of these cues are even available during the satellite SOS initial startup phase, accompanied by a demonstration of how to orient the device.</p><p>Right out of the gate, Google said it knew of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> limit: the fact that it lacks the number of antennas that a phone typically has. In short, Google says the device can't connect to <em>all </em>networks simultaneously, so the company made it so the Pixel Watch 4 will switch if terrestrial networks fail.</p><p>The device is said to offer the satellite option to keep you connected when trying to call emergency services. If you opt in, Google says your Watch 4 will provide a questionnaire to get all the information possible before sending it.</p><p>Google's lead engineer for the Pixel Watch, Sharath Ananth, adds that the satellite SOS mode pretty much locks you into it until help arrives. Ananth says, "...emergencies can be stressful, so we wanted to make it easier to focus on getting help." After 911 has arrived, users can tap "help has arrived" or "I don't need help anymore" to return to their Pixel Watch 4's full experience with apps and more.</p><h2 id="staying-in-contact-2">Staying in contact</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6Cr6En6hizd8XEPyFF3Wc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-AI-Smart-Replies-1" alt="Sending a message on the Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6Cr6En6hizd8XEPyFF3Wc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3880" height="2182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Getting people help in emergencies is the backbone of a feature like satellite SOS. Ananth says this feature isn't only looking out for adventurers on hikes, but everyone in between, too: "I think about getting stranded somewhere, anywhere, and if your phone isn’t working or if you’re injured, this allows you to still activate satellite SOS from your wrist."</p><p>While Google has done a lot of work behind the scenes, with testing in U.S. National Parks to get this to work, it's also using Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a>. When the chip was announced, it was stated that the Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to use this new wearable SoC. While its power is just okay, this chip supports Skylo's Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN), making satellite messaging a reality.</p><p>There are other emergency/safety features on the Pixel Watch 4, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">Crash Detection</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">Fall Detection</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it looks like not all is well, as early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap Ring Stand</a> users have already started reporting issues.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/10/pixelsnap-ring-stand-loose-screw-reports/">9to5Google</a>, many users on Reddit are complaining that the screws on the accessory are coming loose. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nd1362/psa_dont_use_the_pixelsnap_ring_stand_without_a/">users report</a> that their Ring Stand felt "a little wobbly" after just a week, and only a few days later, the screws had fallen off after "no more than 100 folds."</p><p>The user even went on to say that the screws wedged between the case and stand, leaving "shallow scratches" on their case.</p><p>What's worse is that this doesn't seem to be an isolated issue. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n463dx/pixelsnap_ring_stand_broken_in_2_days/">Another Reddit user</a> said their Pixelsnap Ring Stand had loosened so much after just two days of use that it could no longer support their phone's weight.</p><h2 id="pixelsnap-ring-stand-might-not-be-as-sturdy-as-promised-2">Pixelsnap Ring Stand might not be as sturdy as promised</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="QT9KosiZMmZ9gEfg2PqkgX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-XL-Pixelsnap-Ring-Stand" alt="Pixelsnap Ring on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QT9KosiZMmZ9gEfg2PqkgX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2832" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those unfamiliar with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand, the accessory has two small screws near the hinge. These screws secure the moving ring to the magnetic base and create enough friction to keep the ring stable, allowing the accessory to support a phone's weight. It seems these screws are loosening for many users within weeks (or even days) of use.</p><p>There isn't a proper fix yet, though the publication suggests that affected users can use a T1 Torx bit to tighten the screws. Google hasn't officially addressed the issue, but if complaints keep growing, the company may soon issue a statement.</p><p>For now, if you're looking for a Pixelsnap Ring Stand–style accessory for your Pixel 10, it may be better to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-popsockets">third-party phone grips</a>. Brands like Spigen and Anker offer similar phone grips, though Google's Pixelsnap Ring Stand is arguably the most pleasing to look at.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e5ab511d-d435-4802-bebc-a5ada7791994">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJcJyhTSGHkBRpkpPdhcJi.jpg' alt="Spigen O-Mag Ring Magnetic Phone Holder"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Spigen O-Mag Ring</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Durable Pixelsnap Ring Stand alternative</strong></em></p><p>Spigen's O-Mag Ring offers a Pixelsnap Ring Stand like functionality attaching magnetically to the back of the Pixel 10 phones.

Like last year's A18-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>, the platforms are built on a 3nm node, and they share a similar core configuration, offering two performance and six efficiency cores. However, there are clear upgrades available this year, and Apple isn't beating around the bush:</p><p>"When paired with the Apple-designed vapor chamber, A19 Pro enables iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max to deliver up to 40 percent better sustained performance than the previous generation." Obviously, that doesn't mean the A19 Pro is going to be 40% faster than the A18 Pro — that's just not feasible.</p><p>What Apple is alluding to is sustained performance; thanks to a new thermal management system that includes a vapor chamber with deionized water, the latest-gen iPhones will be able to do a much better job during extended gaming sessions. Of course, this is something Android phones have been doing for many years now, and it's telling that Apple is also going this route to deliver better performance.</p><h2 id="what-kind-of-performance-can-we-expect-2">What kind of performance can we expect?</h2><p>As for actual upgrades, we are likely to see anywhere to the tune of a 10 to 15% uptick in CPU performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=iphone18">leaked Geekbench results</a> of the iPhone 17 Pro indicate the same. Even if it isn't much in the way of IPC gains as the A19 Pro is clocked higher at 4.26GHz, it's still a decent amount year-over-year, and it's entirely possible the GPU gains will be greater. Efficiency is also a big deal with this generation, with the efficiency cores getting a 50% increase in cache.</p><p>What's of particular interest to me is that the A19 Pro once again takes the lead in overall CPU scores; while this was the case for much of the last decade, Qualcomm's switch to a fully custom design allowed it to get an edge over Apple, and this was evident not just in synthetic workloads like Geekbench but real-life usage scenarios.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.69%;"><img id="UztPZ9XgesNNXiWRx4myQa" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro thermals" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro thermal management highlighted at launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UztPZ9XgesNNXiWRx4myQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's no wonder, then, that the A19 Pro addresses this issue. I'll need to get my hands on the iPhone 17 Pro to test how the single and multi-core workloads measure up against what's available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Qualcomm and MediaTek are set to announce their next-gen platforms soon, and it will be interesting to see what they bring to the table.</p><h2 id="what-about-ai-performance-2">What about AI performance?</h2><p>Another point of differentiation is around AI; the A19 and A19 Pro have Neural Accelerators built into each GPU core designed to deliver up to a 4x increase in compute. Apple is confident enough in its claims that it says the A19 Pro delivers MacBook-level performance when it comes to AI-assisted workloads. That's joined by a new 16-core Neural Engine with increased memory bandwidth.</p><p>Although Apple didn't talk too much about AI at the event, it's evident that all phone manufacturers are pushing to increase on-device AI utilities as they introduce powerful NPUs tailored to handle these tasks. Apple Intelligence has potential, but it still isn't at a point where it measures up to what Google is doing on its phones.</p><p>There's no question that Google has the edge in this area with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>; the phone has a vast suite of meaningful AI utilities, and it continually gets new features, like the image-to-video Veo 3 engine. If anything, AI is foundational to Google's efforts, and the Tensor G5 is designed around the NPU. While the A19 Pro doesn't put as strong an emphasis on the NPU, it's clear that Apple wants to do better in this segment.</p><h2 id="upgrades-to-look-forward-to-2">Upgrades to look forward to</h2><p>With the touted efficiency gains and all the new features coming to the A19 Pro, I'm excited to get my hands on the iPhone 17 Pro models to see how they differ to their predecessors. While we've had several years of similar-looking designs with little increments, the aluminum unibody designs of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max alongside the new internals and tweaks to the imaging make the devices a much more enticing upgrade this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Spotify's vice president of subscriptions, Gustav Gyllenhammar, said, "The wait is finally over; we’re so excited lossless sound is rolling out to Premium subscribers." Those getting into "Lossless Listening" via Spotify Premium today will find music streamed in 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC, per its post.</p><p>Spotify states this new streaming method will offer listeners "greater detail" for every song on the platform. New releases and even some of those older tracks that you may have in your favorites are supported by Lossless.</p><p>To activate Lossless, users should tap their <strong>Profile icon in the app > Settings & Privacy> Media Quality > select where to enable Lossless: Wi-Fi, Cellular, or Downloads.</strong></p><p>Spotify says you will have to enable Lossless on every device you have manually. More than that, it's recommended to experience Lossless over Wi-Fi with "wired headphones or speakers or a non-Bluetooth connection." Spotify says the size of streamed Lossless audio is much larger, and Bluetooth signals don't have the capacity to support it at its level of crispiness. After you've listened to a Lossless song once, though, it'll load much faster the second time around.</p><h2 id="lossless-is-here-2">Lossless is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="TVUAbkVAEHBsir4WJUxeVa" name="spotify-lossless-activation-guide" alt="To activate Lossless audio on Spotify, users should head into their Profile and navigate to their Media Quality settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TVUAbkVAEHBsir4WJUxeVa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Premium subscribers can use Lossless audio in their own private playlists and Liked Songs, of course. However, Spotify says this feature extends to features like DJ, AI Playlists, Jam, Mix, and Daylist. It's worth keeping in mind that Spotify's Lossless seems to consume roughly 1GB of data per hour it's playing. Spotify says you can choose your Lossless audio quality to help manage how much data is used.</p><p>Lossless Listening will be available on mobile, desktop, tablets, and devices that support Spotify Connect, like Sony, Bose, Samsung, and Sennheiser. Sonos and Amazon devices will grab support "next month."</p><p>As Lossless makes its way to supported regions, Spotify says it's already appearing for users in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden. We haven't seen Lossless appear on the mobile app yet, but we did get a splash screen, stating "we'll notify you when it's available."</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/spotifys-lossless-audio-might-be-right-around-the-corner-per-new-evidence">been waiting on Spotify's Lossless audio</a>, which we've seen previously talked about as Hi-Fi (high fidelity), since 2021.

The company calls it the "best iPhone ever" with catchphrases like "it's unlike everything we've ever created," but many of our readers aren't buying it.</p><p>This time around, it's a little different. There were quite a few feature reveals and announcements that made our team at Android Central genuinely impressed, and Android users should take notice.</p><p>From a reimagined front-facing camera sensor that made us ask, "Why hasn't anyone done this before?" to blood pressure monitoring on Apple Watch, these are the Apple event features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">watches</a> should quickly take inspiration from.</p><h2 id="a-square-selfie-camera-2">A square selfie camera</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yiEdrvg5PVxV3hnScAUd3K" name="iPhone-17-Square-Centerstage" alt="The iPhone 17's new square CenterStage camera sensor in action." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiEdrvg5PVxV3hnScAUd3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are rarely new iPhone features that make me feel the <em>need</em> to upgrade, but Apple's new front-facing camera sensor on the iPhone 17 is one. The CenterStage camera now uses a square aspect ratio, a deviation from the 4:3 size we usually see on most front-facing smartphone cameras. With a 1:1 aspect ratio, the camera can crop in to provide portrait or landscape shots without the user needing to physically rotate their device.</p><p>If you've tried to hold a big flagship in landscape orientation one-handed while trying to get a group selfie, you'll know why this matters. It's easier to corral your phone in portrait orientation, and you can get the best of both worlds with the redesigned CenterStage camera. A simple tap of the screen will rotate the selfie orientation in software, simplifying the experience.</p><p>CenterStage can also use AI to expand the typical field-of-view to make sure everyone fits inside the photo. The resolution is up to 18MP for photos and 4K HDR for videos, so you don't trade versatility for quality. I want <em>every</em> Android flagship to explore using square sensors next upgrade cycle.</p><h2 id="higher-base-and-max-storage-configurations-2">Higher base and max storage configurations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5" name="iphone-17-lineup-pricing-breakdown" alt="Apple's iPhone lineup with pricing following iPhone 17 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">And, Apple did it without raising the base iPhone 17 pricing.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is 128GB of base storage enough in 2025? We think not, and Apple didn't think so either. It raised the base storage for the iPhone 17 lineup across the board, with its newly announced phones starting at 256GB. Amazingly, even considering tariffs and inflation, Apple didn't raise the price of a single model to deliver higher base storage.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're still waiting for Google and Samsung to take the hint and remove the 128GB storage configuration from their flagship lineups. This year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> all start with just 128GB of storage space.</p><p>Apple also raised the storage ceiling on the iPhone 17 Pro Max. You can now equip the smartphone with up to 2TB of storage. The price is a bit laughable at $2,000, but it is a nice option for people who want to use the "pro" camera system for high-quality video recording formats with extreme storage demands.</p><h2 id="dual-capture-recording-2">Dual Capture recording</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN" name="Apple-iPhone-17-Pro-camera-close-up-250909" alt="Render of iPhone 17 Pro's "camera plateau"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Apple does something, it often becomes mainstream. That's what we're hoping to see happen with Dual Capture recording on the iPhone 17 series. It allows users to record both the front- and rear-facing camera views at the same time, which is great for POV-style videos that also provide insight into what the person is actually seeing in their surroundings.</p><p>Samsung actually already offers this feature in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-directors-view-shooting-mode-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra">Director's View on select Galaxy phone models</a>. With this tool, you can simultaneously record both camera views or switch between them on your Samsung phone. But it's a relatively unknown feature among casual users, and other Android phone brands haven't been quick to borrow it. As such, we would like to see OEMs like Google add options like Dual Capture or Director's View soon.</p><h2 id="blood-pressure-monitoring-2">Blood pressure monitoring</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-BPM" alt="Blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch Series 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch has featured blood pressure monitoring for years now. However, U.S. availability has become a major hurdle. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> has all the sensors for it, but the brand won't flip on the feature in this region, presumably for regulatory reasons. Well, this is a problem Apple officially solved with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">hypertension warnings</a> on the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3.</p><p>It's not replacing medical-grade detection methods, but blood pressure monitoring and hypertension warnings could literally save lives.</p><p>"Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease, and impacts approximately 1.3 billion adults globally," the company explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" target="_blank">press release</a>. "It is frequently undiagnosed because it often has no symptoms, many people do not see a doctor regularly, and even during a clinical visit, it can be easily missed with a single measurement."</p><p>For these reasons, we're thrilled to see Apple Watch support blood pressure monitoring in the U.S., and we want to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> get on board sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="an-affordable-smartwatch-with-current-specs-2">An affordable smartwatch with current specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="waGwpWjty7Wbnxr3pJGQjN" name="Apple-Watch-SE-3" alt="The Apple Watch SE 3 promo against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/waGwpWjty7Wbnxr3pJGQjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Affordable versions of Wear OS smartwatches usually cut quite a few corners to hit an approachable price point. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung's Galaxy Watch FE</a>, for example, uses recycled and older hardware to hit an affordable cost. You can always buy older models, like a Galaxy Watch 7 or Pixel Watch 3, but we want something better. Apple's newly announced Apple Watch SE 3 strikes the perfect balance of modern feature set and affordability.</p><p>It costs just $249, and doesn't sacrifice much in terms of hardware. There's the Apple S10 system-in-package (SiP) processor, 5G cellular connectivity, and an always-on display (AOD). Offered in 41mm and 44mm sizes, it's a versatile smartwatch that runs the latest watchOS 26 operating system.</p><p>In fact, the Apple Watch SE 3 supporting 5G is notable because most flagship Wear OS watches are limited to just 4G LTE connectivity. We'd like to see more Android watches adopt 5G, and we'd also like to see better value-oriented wearables on the Wear OS side.</p><h2 id="features-apple-stole-from-android-2">Features Apple "Stole" from Android</h2><p>Apple also "borrowed" a handful of Android features and characteristics, most notably the camera bar, which it's eloquently calling the camera <em>plateau</em>.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For seven years now, most iPhone models have shipped with an OLED display. It was a long-awaited change for some users who had already experienced the punchy colors and inky blacks associated with Android phones that used the technology, and while it enhanced picture quality a lot, it also came with a nasty surprise for some: headaches and eye strain caused by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>.</p><p>This year, Google launched a new accessibility mode that's supposed to help users who find OLEDs more painful than pleasurable, but the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-display-interview">didn't actually do what users needed</a>. Turns out, Apple was also working on a solution, and, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-pro-pwm-toggle/">Mac Rumors</a>, the iPhone 17 family has a new accessibility option that <em>disables</em> PWM dimming entirely.</p><p>The new setting, found under the Display and Text Size section of accessibility settings in iOS 26, reads "<em>Disables pulse width modulation (PWM) to provide a different way to dim the OLED display, which can create a smoother display output at low brightness levels. Disabling PWM may affect low brightness display performance under certain conditions."</em></p><p>Mac Rumors notes that while all iPhone 17 series phones have the new option, they aren't sure if the setting will come to older iPhone or iPad models. We've reached out to Apple for additional information on this new feature and will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-this-is-important-2">Why this is important</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-sensitive-eyes-pwm-accessibility-feature" alt="The new "adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" PWM-adjustment feature on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on the language, it seems that Apple's new accessibility option is likely identical to what Motorola launched back on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>. That means the phone doesn't use PWM dimming at all. Instead, it'll use DC-like dimming to adjust the brightness of the display, making it significantly more friendly for <em>everyone</em>, not just those of us who suffer from PWM sensitivity.</p><p>We don't yet know the specifics of how the new setting works, but there's a clear difference in the language versus what Google's Pixel 10 Pro family provides. Google's accessibility setting notes that it "adjusts emission frequency" to help sensitive users, but this only doubles the PWM frequency from 240Hz to 480Hz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">Research shows</a> that PWM dimming needs to occur at a minimum of 3000Hz to help most users, so Google's mode isn't exactly effective.</p><p>Most phones from Chinese brands have offered the ability to either adjust or disable PWM dimming for years, with companies like Honor using up to 4320Hz dimming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">in its latest phones</a>. Since most of these Chinese brands aren't officially available in the US, users who are sensitive to light flicker, like PWM dimming, haven't had an abundance of choice. Notably, the three most popular brands — Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel — offered <strong>no</strong> relief for these folks until now.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What PWM dimming looks like on a camera using a fast shutter speed. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This move should help push the entire OLED industry forward and make OLED displays more friendly for all users. I wasn't PWM-sensitive until 2022, and it took me several months to figure out that it was my phone's OLED display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">causing the issue</a>. Many users don't know that their phones' displays rapidly flicker on and off to control brightness, and likely have no idea it's what's been causing their headaches.</p><p>It's estimated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://caseorganic.medium.com/the-invisible-light-thats-harming-our-health-and-how-we-can-light-things-better-d3916de90521">up to 20% of the population</a> suffers from some form of flicker sensitivity and likely doesn't realize it. Since the flickering is "invisible" to our eyes, most people don't even know that LEDs and some fluorescent bulbs rapidly turn on and off to manage brightness, but our brains perceive this, and some people are "allergic" to it. Think of it like being allergic to gluten but not knowing that gluten exists. You would constantly experience pain, but not understand the cause since most people around you don't suffer from it.</p><p>By adopting this new accessibility setting, Apple's move will hopefully push Samsung and Google to finally fix their OLED displays and offer all users dimming options that are better for their eyes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

ANC is <strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong>, and it's an electronic means of suppressing outside and ambient noises that may be loud or simply bothersome, like a crowded bus, a crying baby, or an aircraft engine.</p><p>All headphones are noise canceling to some extent because they are either plugged into your ear or cover it. This blocks a good bit of the regular ambient noises in life, but sometimes you need a little more, and that's where ANC comes into play.</p><p>AMC uses sound itself to mute sound. Yes, you read that right. With dedicated microphones and fast microprocessors, you can say goodbye to that noisy jet engine when you're trying to sleep on a midnight flight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ambient-passthrough" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not all headphones or earbuds use electronic noise cancellation, and you'll notice the brands and models that do will cost a little more. The parts and engineering needed aren't crazy expensive, but they will add to the cost.</p><p>Additionally, some individuals cannot use headphones with any form of electronic noise suppression. I know because, unfortunately, I'm one of them. Just like a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">phone screen causes trouble</a> for some people, the method used to suppress noises can cause a terrible headache, and some people say they can even <em>hear</em> it. Thankfully, most people are unaffected, and headphones with ANC are quite popular and easy to find.</p><h2 id="so-how-does-anc-work-2">So how does ANC work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1195px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="5fVKr7JgUEkWVmi5HqHbsY" name="soundform" alt="A sound waveform mock-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fVKr7JgUEkWVmi5HqHbsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1195" height="672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The way ANC works is super cool and almost seems like some sort of secret dark magic. It's not, of course: it's pure science that's not even hard to do thanks to the way sound "works".</p><p>All sound is expressed as a sound wave. The simple diagram above gives you an idea of what I'm talking about, and you've likely seen something similar when discussing sound.</p><p>Wave is a good term because you'll find crests and valleys, just as you would on a series of waves in the ocean. The distance between the "top" of the crest and the "bottom" of the valley is called the <em>amplitude</em>, and an easy way to think about it is that it determines how loud a particular portion of the sound will be. The distance between the crests is called the <em>frequency</em>. A larger number indicates a higher frequency, which means that portion of the sound is in a higher pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FTu2kqVG4sgkoqRJc7pFCJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-peq-q-factor.JPG" alt="Astell & Kern Activo P1 showing 20-band parametric equalizer Q-factor adjustiment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTu2kqVG4sgkoqRJc7pFCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most important part is that <strong>this is a constant</strong>. Different sounds will create different sound waves, but frequency and amplitude are always measurable. A computer can get exact readings of all this information, and it uses it to cancel annoying noises, combined with a good microphone and a noise-generation device of some sort. Yes, you really use noise to get rid of noise.</p><p>Let's go back to the diagram for a minute. The black line is what we'll call the zero point. The red line is the noise you don't want to hear. The blue line is what is created when a computer analyzes the red wave and recreates it.</p><p>That sound, which should be an exact copy of the noise you're trying to get rid of, is played at 180 degrees out of phase (think of it as being flipped on its head). The blue wave crests when the red wave dips in perfect harmony. This creates what's known as <em>destructive interference</em>.</p><p>When the amplitude and frequency of the red wave are matched in reverse by the blue wave, the total amplitude is zero. Think of a crest as +5, and a valley as -5. When you subtract 5 from 5, you're left with nothing. A zero amplitude, zero frequency tone is no tone at all - dead silence.</p><p>Because nothing is ever perfect, the waveforms won't be exactly 180 degrees out of phase consistently. This can cause a small, barely audible humming noise. You might have heard this from time to time if you use headphones with ANC, and it's what gives some people a fit when trying to use them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="bKzgByJ6DRDDqRCseXh5rY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKzgByJ6DRDDqRCseXh5rY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="1728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">headphones or earbuds with ANC</a> have microphones that don't listen to whatever is coming through the headphones themselves. Instead, they are listening to the outside noise.</p><p>Using the waveform of <strong>only</strong> the outside noise and doing this bit of science on it makes it seem like it has gone away while leaving what you want to hear alone. Some headphone and earbud models have a way to turn ANC off and use the dedicated microphones to playback outside noise, and when you hear people talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review">audio passthrough</a>, that's what is happening.</p><p>You don't need to know any of this to enjoy noise-free listening, but it's always fun to know how something so cool and seemingly complicated really works.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released in 2025 so far, and this surprise deal makes the AI-boosted smartphone dirt cheap. </p><p>If you don't need this much power, it's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>T-Mobile is offering the same $800 discount on the base model Pixel 10</strong>,</a> effectively making that phone completely free with an eligible line. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a2a29269-e913-4f82-8373-2c6998a4e0c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> was announced alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup during a Made by Google event on August 20th. The phone is powered by the super-efficient Tensor G5 processor and comes with a gorgeous 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, 16GB of RAM, and 25W Qi2 magnetic charging (which is a rarity for Android devices). </p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro also boasts all of the AI-boosted camera features we&apos;ve come to expect from the OEM, plus I&apos;ve been enjoying the upgraded gaming performance (not to mention seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, but that&apos;s pretty standard these days). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Compared to last year&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro</a>, you&apos;ll also see some improvements in battery life and Android 16 right out of the box. </p><p>If I had to nitpick some flaws in the device, I&apos;d say that removing physical SIM support from the Pixel 10 series was a bad move, and 128GB of base storage also feels like a strange decision in this day and age. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM rate</a> is still bad if you&apos;re sensitive to that, and I&apos;m not sure if the Tensor G5 can match the performance of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Again, this is all pretty nitpicky stuff, and if you&apos;re already a fan of Pixel devices, the Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">plenty of offers</a> that can make the $999.99 flagship much cheaper (or even free), but if you want a straightforward carrier promotion that doesn&apos;t require a trade-in, T-Mobile&apos;s Pixel 10 Pro deal has the competition beat. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Back in 2020, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-quick-charge-5">Quick Charge 5 set the pace with over 100W of power</a>, which was enough to take a device from zero to 50% in about five minutes.</p><p>Now, Qualcomm says Quick Charge 5+ maintains the same fast performance while directly addressing the heat issues common with high-voltage charging.</p><h2 id="smarter-power-delivery-2">Smarter power delivery</h2><p>The upgrade adjusts voltage and current on the go, using up to 20V at 7A to deliver power with less heat buildup. This means your device can stay at top speeds for longer without throttling or cooking your battery.</p><p>Qualcomm also claims this will help extend battery life and keep performance steady even during demanding tasks like gaming or streaming.</p><p>Efficiency is another big focus. Quick Charge 5+ identifies what kind of device it’s plugged into and optimizes power delivery, which not only wastes less energy but could also lower costs for manufacturers.</p><p>Compared to other solutions that crank up voltage just to hit big wattage numbers, the new iteration takes a more balanced approach that avoids unnecessary heat and inefficiency.</p><h2 id="it-plays-well-with-others-2">It plays well with others</h2><p>Compatibility shouldn’t be an issue either. Quick Charge 5+ works with older Quick Charge gear (back to 2.0) and will play nice with upcoming devices set to debut at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomms-next-powerful-chip-gets-a-launch-date-in-september">Snapdragon Summit 2025 later this month</a>.</p><p>And you don’t need a Snapdragon-powered device to benefit, as it’s designed to match competitor chargers on non-Qualcomm hardware too. Accessories using the new standard are expected to start shipping later this year.</p><p>With Quick Charge 5+, Qualcomm wants to make fast charging more practical for real-world use. Cooler operation, smarter power handling, and broad compatibility could make this the go-to option for the next wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> and laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not direct blood pressure monitoring, but that almost makes Apple's new system more compelling — and rival brands will be scrambling to emulate it.</p><p>Users in Europe or Asia can get smartwatch-based blood pressure tracking with a Huawei Watch D2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> (with a cuff). But unless you're aware of chronic high blood pressure issues, you may not take advantage of this tool often. And a smartwatch won't replace a medical-grade blood pressure monitor.</p><p>I won't downplay the usefulness of convenient, on-the-go smartwatch BP checks for anyone unwilling to go to a doctor. But since Samsung has never gotten FDA approval — and several clinical studies with Galaxy Watches showed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"insufficient accuracy"</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"substantial pre-post calibration BP difference"</a> — it's not something I'd actively recommend to at-risk relatives, even if I could.</p><p>Samsung also has a newer, indirect method of predicting hypertension — its Vascular Load stat — but it's not as straightforward as Apple's method, which will come to "more than 150 countries and regions," including the U.S. and EU this month, and pass FDA clearance "soon."</p><p>Once it does, I could see the Apple Watch Series 11 becoming even more popular than past models. Anyone in an at-risk age group, or whose family is predisposed to chronic high blood pressure, will want these early warning signs.</p><h2 id="apple-found-a-depressingly-common-condition-to-predict-2">Apple found a depressingly common condition to predict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE" name="apple-hypertension-alert" alt="A render of the Apple Watch Series 11 showing a "possible hypertension" pop-up, with an iPhone next to it showing more details on "patterns related to hypertension" from the last 30 days of heart data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html">CDC</a> reports that 119.9 million American adults, or 48.1%, suffer from hypertension, while only 27 million have their condition "under control." 34 million Americans with hypertension had yet to fill or start taking their prescriptions. And "1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure is unaware of it and would not report having it."</p><p>Hypertension was a "primary or contributing cause of 664,470 deaths" in the United States in 2023, primarily from heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. Worldwide, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension">WHO</a> estimates 1.28 billion people have hypertension, with only 42% "diagnosed and treated."</p><p>These numbers speak for themselves. Chronic high blood pressure is painfully common, and the people with it either aren't aware or aren't willing to treat themselves, whether due to financial concerns or because they're otherwise healthy and assume they don't need to worry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE" name="apple-watch-series-11-hypertension" alt="A render of two Apple Watch Series 11 models, one showing a Sleep Score, the other showing a "Possible Hypertension" alert." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For something like sleep apnea or AFib, a smartwatch alert is obviously useful, but at least these conditions have physical symptoms that you could detect on your own. With hypertension, Apple correctly notes in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/">press release</a>, it "often has no symptoms" and "can be easily missed" if you only get readings once a year at the doctor's office.</p><p>Apple used "training data from multiple studies totaling over 100,000 participants," synced up against a "clinical study of over 2,000 participants," to make its machine learning algorithm. It'll then compare 30 days of optical HR data against its own data to spot any warning signs.</p><p>Apple predicts that out of the millions of users with an Apple Watch S9, S10, S11, Ultra 2, or Ultra 3, it'll spot signs of hypertension in a million people "within the first year."</p><p>That could very well prove hyperbolic, and I'll side-eye Apple if the FDA takes long to validate the feature. However, I'm truly optimistic that this could end up being a widespread tool, building awareness for a pervasive and dangerous condition. Regardless of which smartwatch brand you're a fan of, that's a great thing.</p><h2 id="android-and-fitness-watches-have-their-own-life-saving-tools-2">Android and fitness watches have their own life-saving tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Vascular-Load" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who wears a Galaxy Watch 8,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review"> Watch 8 Classic</a>, or Watch Ultra 24/7 will get Samsung's Vascular Load data, which takes your sleep data and "measures blood volume and vascular stiffness and precisely analyzes changes in stress on blood vessels."</p><p>Arterial stiffness is one potential sign of hypertension, among other heart conditions. But Samsung's Vascular Load graph is more about pointing out how lifestyle choices like sodium intake or drinking cause heart strain in the short term, and while that's valid, it also puts the onus on the user to get better scores when the true cause might be genetic. Plus, it focuses on sleep strain, not necessarily strain during the day.</p><p>I think Samsung could end up launching something more targeted to hypertension in the future, based on the data it collects now, and it <em>should</em>. Hopefully, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> brands will follow suit eventually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse.jpg" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 is the first Google device to feature the Loss of Pulse feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1900" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for other life-saving smartwatch tricks, the most obvious one is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/how-enable-loss-of-pulse-detection-google-pixel-watch">Loss of Pulse detection</a>, which contacts emergency services during cardiac arrest or other major heart issues. If no one is around to report it, this could save your life, though it's obviously a last resort for someone with unresolved health issues.</p><p>On the preventative front, Samsung, Google/Fitbit, Withings, and Apple offer passive irregular heart rhythm warnings. More brands offer ECGs for active AFib data, but you may not use them after getting one "normal" sinus reading; passive data is vital for making more people aware they should check their heart regularly, just like hypertension alerts point people toward using a BP machine.</p><p>It's clearer than ever that we're entering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical era of wearables</a>. Samsung is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">virtual doctor visits and prescription management</a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> adds better temperature sensors to catch people "falling under the weather."</p><p>Apple's hypertension alerts are just the latest strike in this battle, but it's an impressive one. Knowing if you or loved ones are at risk for stroke, heart failure, or other conditions will intrigue a lot of people.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Apple might not realize it, there is a world outside of the walled gardens in Cupertino, and we spotted a few things that Apple "stole" from Android during the event.</p><p>However, we have to admit, compared to years past, this list is a lot lighter than we expected. Usually, we can stick to the confines of the iPhone, but this year, we had to broaden the horizon a bit more.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-thin-phone-2">An ultra thin phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can file this in the category of "what's the point," but the iPhone Air was officially introduced, a phone that's just 5.6mm thin.

Unfortunately, it's not the kind of update you'd want to hear, as a new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 Ultra may take a step back with its 3x telephoto zoom camera.</p><p>Earlier reports indicated that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">switch to a new 12MP sensor</a> for the 3x telephoto zoom on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Many assumed this would mean crisper zoom and close-up shots. However, according to reliable tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1965598697519198438">Ice Universe</a>, Samsung will crop the 12MP down to just 10MP on the new sensor.</p><p>The leaker claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra will use only 10MP (of the 12MP available) with an f/2.4 aperture, a 1/3.94" sensor size, and 1.0μm pixels. While this may sound similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which also used a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor, it could result in a downgraded experience overall.</p><h2 id="smaller-pixels-may-hurt-low-light-performance-2">Smaller pixels may hurt low-light performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To break it down, the Galaxy S25 Ultra had a 1/3.53" 10MP sensor with 1.12μm pixel size. The Galaxy S26 Ultra may use a larger sensor, but with smaller 1.0μm pixels. For reference, the pixel size determines how much light is captured — the larger the number, the more light and typically the better the photos.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> scaling back to smaller pixels, the new sensor could let in less light than its predecessor, leading to weaker 3x shots in low-light conditions.</p><p>Of course, Samsung could offset this with software optimizations and an improved ISP, but based purely on hardware, it looks like we may be in for a slight downgrade on the next Ultra flagship.</p><p>Past rumors about the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest the phone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">keep the S Pen</a>, adopt a slimmer build, and support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">faster 60W charging</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_1362924355208326874&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-4792126853743754287%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fcell-phones%252F1105910%253Fpovid%253Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel%2Fway-to-get-pixel-10-with-physical-sim-in-us" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1187103296997437100-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-1015660682400264613&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1026776483449387902&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

You could say this device is a little bit of a wild card, as it was pretty much exclusive to the South Korean market. The foldable had a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8-inch internal display with a thinner, lighter build. The Special Edition didn't quite make headlines like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> did, as that model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">offered upgrades far beyond</a> the former.</p><p>That popularity is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">something Samsung is scrambling</a> to keep up with, as a recent report says the company needs to make more. The company is reportedly boosting its original production plans for the Fold 7 in September, going from 200,000 units to 260,000 units. This influx of popularity also forced Samsung to alter its plans in August, bumping things up by nearly 100,000 units to meet demand.</p><p>We're still very early in this alleged second Wide-Fold rumor.

Google states that its AI Quests will take students through a fantasy world, one that places them in the position of data researchers and fields such as medicine to solve problems with AI, and learn how that's applied.</p><p>AI Quests isn't extensive just yet; however, Google states the first quest will put students, ages 11 to 14, through Flood Forecasting research. These immersive, adventurous quests will show kids how AI can "help predict floods and give communities timely flood warnings."</p><p>These AI Quests are almost like a game, as they encourage kids to collect "relevant" data, evaluate that data, and test their theories (test the model). Google states this first quest is designed to teach students two important lessons: the importance of human judgment and how data quality can shape an AI's results. After the simulation is completed, Google says students will receive a video from the real researchers explaining their work.</p><p>There's also a set of activities to complete before and after the quest. AI Quests is available today (Sep 9) for educators and organizations in learning.</p><h2 id="google-sees-ai-in-the-classroom-2">Google sees AI in the classroom</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNGMGvk0vu8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Stanford Accelerator for Learning is integrating AI Quests into CRAFT as part of its partnership with Google Research. Victor R. Lee, faculty lead for AI and education at Stanford Accelerator for Learning, said, "Our partnership with Google Research is a powerful example of how academia and industry can come together."</p><p>AI Quests are expecting an update "in the coming months" that will add two more adventures for educators to give students. One quest will walk students through the journey of identifying diabetic retinopathy, a catalyst for blindness. The other is reportedly a quest to "map and understand" the human brain.</p><p>While so hard on AI, Google dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-empowers-google-classroom-educators-ai-focused-tools-notebooklm">Gemini-powered update for Classrooms</a>, bringing its selection of AI tools to teacher lesson plans and more. Educators were given access to NotebookLM, capable of creating enhanced study guides for kids. Gems also rolled out, so teachers could create an AI "expert" in a singular topic to further a child's learning for topics they may struggle with.</p><p>More than that, in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/college-students-get-google-ai-pro-plan-free-with-gemini-2-5-pro-announced">college students in the U.S.</a> and other regions were given Google's AI Pro plan for free.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The software has plenty of useful features, and the device runs Android 16 out of the box.

As much as I like the Magic V5, Honor's reluctance to modernize the software means it is severely lagging behind in this area, and that's a limiting factor.

The update brings a few noteworthy improvements, per its changelog, that users will install once the update becomes available via the app on their phone. To begin, Meta's rolling out an update for the Oakley cameras. The patch notes state users should notice a much faster camera experience, enabling them to take photos and record videos quickly.</p><p>Joining this update is another that involves Meta's wake word prompt for capturing content with Oakley's cameras. The company states users can now say, "Hey Meta, restyle this." This voice prompt pushes your glasses to capture what you're looking at and pop a random "surprising style" on it. The notes say <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">Meta AI</a> cycles through a set number of styles when you utter this phrase—plus, you can save and share whatever it produces.</p><p>This is rolling out for English users in the U.S., Canada, India, Mexico, UAE, and Australia.</p><p>Voice searches have been expanded in this update. Now, English users outside of the U.S. can use voice commands for Audible. Other updates include the ability to connect your Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook to your Oakley Meta glasses to receive notifications about events and the ability to create new ones. To connect, Meta states users should head into the <strong>Meta AI app > Tap profile icon > App connections > connect Calendar</strong>.</p><h2 id="oakley-s-gonna-be-gonna-be-golden-2">Oakley's gonna be, gonna be golden</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rkRbPSixBvgR5Ru2q8uos8" name="oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-warm-white-prizm-lenses-03" alt="A pair of warm white limited edition Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with PRIZM lenses with running shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkRbPSixBvgR5Ru2q8uos8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final update concerns location reminders. Meta explains this as a feature that leans on your location services, if you've enabled them. When setting a reminder, your location will also be saved. The patch notes state users can go back and ask Meta AI about the place where they've created the reminder.</p><p>This update was spotted rolling out this morning (Sep 9), so more users should begin noticing it as the week progresses.</p><p>A month before the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses launched, we got our hands on the device to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">test the company's "battery upgrades</a>." While there's a lot of real-world data to get through, the short of it is that the Oakley glasses will last longer with the "Hey Meta" voice command disabled. You can still get to Meta AI by tapping/holding the side touchpad. More tests showed that these new lenses can capture roughly 60% more pictures and video than Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, and these "faster camera" updates today only make this more of a breeze to do.</p><p>Also, it seems we might've nailed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">Oakley Meta HSTN's superpower</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vinyl records nearly died out in favor of CDs, until they became nostalgic and actually outsold CDs in 2023 for the first time since 1987. Music listening often breaks common conventions of technological progress because, at the end of the day, listeners have simple wants and needs. Great sound, convenience, and immersion are just a few.</p><p>Those simple desires allow for older, obsolete formats and media to make a comeback. Over time, our definition of what is "convenient," for example, changes. Recently, casual listeners valued convenience in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">truly wireless earbuds</a> without a cord in sight. That's starting to shift, with wired earbuds now becoming hip and fashionable again, and the flurry of wired earbud announcements I saw at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a> proves it.</p><p>Sony announced a pair of wired USB-C earbuds during the event called the IER-EX15C USB-C, and I'll be testing those soon. But the more exciting announcement came from Belkin, which is taking advantage of the opportunity that comes with ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack for USB-C. Belkin's new SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds have a party trick we don't usually see in this category: active noise-canceling (ANC).</p><h2 id="what-makes-the-belkin-soundform-usb-c-wired-earbuds-unique-2">What makes the Belkin SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds unique</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ku8jYSiZu9MsnFdkWdKe2A" name="Belkin-USBC-earbuds-2" alt="The Belkin SoundForm USB-C wired earbuds with ANC at IFA." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku8jYSiZu9MsnFdkWdKe2A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wired earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii-best-iem-ive-used-yet">in-ear monitors (IEMs)</a> don't typically offer ANC, and that's because the 3.5mm headphone jack is only designed to transfer small amounts of power — usually the bare minimum needed to drive earbuds, headphones, and microphones. The microchips and processing needed to take in sound data from onboard microphones and counter them with ANC require more power than a 3.5mm jack can typically provide.</p><p>That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">ANC-powered headphones</a> and earbuds are often battery-powered, even in wired mode. The built-in battery helps power those extra features. When we lost the 3.5mm jack on phones, tablets, and other devices, it was seen as a downgrade. In many ways, that's true, but the USB-C port also presents a fantastic opportunity for audio listening.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C port</a> is the most versatile we've ever seen, capable of delivering power and data in large volumes at the same time. That's what makes a product like the Belkin SoundForm USB-C possible — the earbuds can siphon power from your phone or other device over the USB-C cable, while transferring audio and powering the ANC features within.</p><p>By offering ANC in a cheap pair of earbuds with a flat, wired USB-C cable, Belkin already has something special here. Combined with the 12mm drivers and a few EQ presets, you get features once exclusive to higher-priced wireless earbuds in a $35 wired package. It's great for buyers on a budget or for people who just want the convenience of using a cable.</p><h2 id="why-we-need-wired-earbuds-to-get-good-again-2">Why we need wired earbuds to get good again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ" name="iem-hero-1.jpg" alt="IEM hero shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wireless and wired earbuds each have their own ideal set of use cases, but contrary to popular belief, one form factor can't rule them all. Wired earbuds particularly excel if you want to avoid losses in audio quality due to Bluetooth. Granted, a pair of $35 earbuds with smaller drivers probably won't make the most of lossless audio quality — but neither will premium wireless earbuds in a lossy Bluetooth codec.</p><p>I also love using wired earbuds in situations where I can't risk a truly wireless earbud falling out of my ears. One specific circumstance is while traveling, when an earbud slips out of my ear on a plane or while running through a new city, it is a worst-case scenario. Plus, the affordable price of entry means I can use them without worrying about a high replacement cost if they get lost or broken.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.belkin.com/pr-belkin-ifa-2025.html" target="_blank">Belkin SoundForm USB-C</a>, you get all the convenience benefits of wired audio without losing IPX5 water-resistance or ANC support, which were previously key drawbacks. Of course, you still run into the issue of charging or using other accessories while using USB-C headphones, which is why you'll probably need wireless headphones in certain instances.</p><p>These earbuds debut next month, and I think they'll usher in a new wave of modern wired audio products that we desperately need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Many S Pen fans have been fearing the worst for the past few months, and for good reason.</p><p>Samsung has been making some moves that the S Pen fans, even though in the minority, have been caught off guard. First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor">it removed Bluetooth S Pen features on the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and more recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">ditched the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, </a>as the Korean OEM wanted to keep things sleek and compact on the phone, which has caused us to think about the future of the S Pen itself.</p><p>While the company continues to make phones lighter and sleeker, we feel that the stylus could be a thing of the past. However, this may not be the case for the next-gen Galaxy S26 Ultra, a new leak from prominent tipster, Ice Universe, hints that the device will indeed keep the S Pen, with alleged device renders showing a dedicated slot for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP" name="Galaxy-s26-Ultra-leaked-Spen-slot" alt="S Pen support on Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe/ X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't completely abandoning the S Pen across its device ecosystem. This is evident in its recent unveiling of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsungs-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-is-here-and-it-aims-to-replace-your-laptop">Galaxy S11 Tab and the premium S11 Tab Ultra,</a> which come with stylus support. The company launched a new S Pen showcasing a hexagonal form factor that was engineered to look and feel like a traditional pencil. So, the company won't really stop making these styluses, which implies its support for future Galaxy phones (Phew!).</p><p>In another post earlier today, Ice Universe shared some details about the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera, which may feature a new main camera and a larger telephoto lens, with a wider aperture, potentially resulting in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-leak-suggests-sharper-brighter-low-light-photos">improved low-light images</a>. Additionally, the tipster notes that the camera bump on the Galaxy S26 Ultra will be thicker than that of the S25 Ultra, increasing from 2.4mm to 4.5mm.  Despite the thicker camera bump, the telephoto sensor might still be surprisingly small for a flagship phone, which is a bummer, they add.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera bump reaches 4.5mm (compared to 2.4mm on the S25 Ultra), driven by the large-aperture main camera and telephoto lens. Hopefully, the improvement will justify this increased thickness. Samsung could easily accommodate a larger telephoto sensor… pic.twitter.com/hyKT8KuHNn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1965368429134971265">September 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As for the other specs of the Galaxy S26 Ultra, it is said to get more comfortable to hold on to, with rounded corners ditching its "Note-like" edge-y corners, which some users complained are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/S24Ultra/comments/1iu25t9/darn_these_sharp_edges_lol/" target="_blank">ripping a hole in people's pockets.</a> The phone will alleged get a 6.9-inch display using Samsung’s latest third-gen anti-reflective glass. Configurations could go up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p><p>The rear camera array might include four cameras: a 200MP main, a 50MP periscope with a wider aperture than the S25 Ultra, a 50MP ultrawide, and an upgraded 12MP short-range telephoto. The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra could be sticking to its predecessor's 5,000mAh battery, but could see faster 60W charging speeds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Shortly after, the company posted another teaser on X/Twitter saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-sets-date-for-gemini-on-google-home">Gemini is coming to Google Home</a> on October 1, while also teasing the new Nest Cam. Since then, the new Nest products have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/expect-better-cameras-and-new-gemini-ai-tricks-in-googles-next-nest-devices">spotted in the Google Home</a> app.</p><p>Now, a new leak gives us our first look at the Nest Doorbell 2K's box and some of its features. Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nest/comments/1nby3dl/new_2k_doorbell/">one2zerojigawat</a> reportedly got their hands on the smart doorbell nearly three weeks ahead of launch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-nest-doorbell-2k-retail-box-leak-3596030/">Android Authority</a>).</p><h2 id="google-nest-doorbell-2k-spotted-on-shelves-2">Google Nest Doorbell 2K spotted on shelves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXhsxqrgvxxKc3ApCwuFLX" name="Google-Nest-Doorbell-2k-retail-leak" alt="Retail box of the leaked Google Nest Doorbell 2K" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXhsxqrgvxxKc3ApCwuFLX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with other recent Google products, the Nest Doorbell 2K will ship in minimal packaging. The box confirms the official name as "Nest Doorbell 2K" rather than Nest Doorbell 3rd gen. It also shows whether the doorbell is wired or wireless, along with prominent Gemini branding.</p><p>On the back, the packaging reveals specs like 2K resolution, HDR video, 166-degree FoV, night vision, two-way audio, and weather resistance. Inside the box, you'll find the doorbell, chime, base plate, a 20-degree wedge, wire connector, and screws/anchors.</p><p>The most interesting part of the packaging, though, is a label at the bottom: "Subscription (sold separately) required for certain features, including Gemini and some AI experiences." The exact features we can expect from the new doorbell aren't listed, but it's likely tied to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-aware-vs-ring-protect">Nest Aware</a> being rebranded as Google Home Premium, alongside a pricier tier called Google Home Premium Advanced.</p><p>We still don't know the pricing or availability of the new Nest Doorbell 2K, but with Google set to share updates on Gemini and smart home on October 1, all of the news surrounding Google's new smart home products should be official in just a few days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OLED debuted on mobile devices 15 years ago with the release of the original Samsung Galaxy, eventually usurping LCD as the de facto standard display type.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>However, the tides are shifting, and customers want something more user-friendly than OLED, a technology that looks great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting" target="_blank">but causes headaches</a> and eye strain in a notable percentage of people. Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">TCL's NXTPAPER technology</a>, a custom type of LCD that includes multiple comfort layers and custom tuning, including a matte anti-glare layer and black levels previously thought unachievable for the tech.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-announces-nxtpaper-60-ultra-comfortable-4-0-display-tech-at-ifa-2025">TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra</a> is the first smartphone equipped with the latest version of NXTPAPER, and it just might be my favorite smartphone display of all time. As someone who regularly seeks out alternative types of displays with better comfort ratings, NXTPAPER greatly appeals to me. Now, with NXTPAPER 4.0, I'm finally seeing the fruits of TCL's labor and can fully recommend it as a legit alternative to OLED. Here are all the details.</p><h2 id="comfort-above-all-2">Comfort above all</h2><p>As I said in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra display review</a>, <em>all</em> modern flagship phone displays look good. Any rating assigned to one over the other is generally nitpicking between characteristics that the average person simply doesn't see or care about.</p><p>That's why comfort is the new benchmark of display quality. A high comfort rating ensures <strong>all</strong> users can see and enjoy content on a display, no matter if they're looking at it for 5 minutes or 5 hours.</p><p>In the modern digital age, where a smartphone is practically essential for everyday life, it's becoming increasingly more important for companies to make devices that work for everyone, including those of us with visual disabilities or limitations.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reflectivity-and-brightness"><span>Reflectivity and brightness</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uXacQzsauB5RC25U2AgwdG" name="bigme-hibreak-pro-tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing outdoor visibility in direct sunlight between the Bigme HiBreak Pro, TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uXacQzsauB5RC25U2AgwdG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3400" height="1912" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An up-and-coming trend in smartphone displays is glare reduction. All NXTPAPER devices feature a matte anti-reflective layer, but NXTPAPER 4.0 features a redesigned substrate and nano-matrix lithography application to enhance brightness and color accuracy.</p><p>This updated anti-glare layer is incredibly effective, reducing reflections so much that the display looks almost identical to full-color paper printing. It's actually wild looking at the screen throughout the day and seeing such a gorgeous, flat-lit display that doesn't force me to squint or strain to see.</p><p>The effect is best in any indoor condition or when outside in partial shade. Inside, the anti-glare layer is perfect for reducing those annoying reflections from adjacent lights or any brightly lit object. In this environment, zero reflection of any kind is visible, and it makes the phone a joy to use versus any other display technology I've used to date.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5909px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="itksEPRygAZG5MYkRZKk5o" name="nxtpaper-vs-oled-vs-e-ink-sunlight" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility between a TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a Bigme HiBreak Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itksEPRygAZG5MYkRZKk5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5909" height="3324" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about NXTPAPER 4.0 is its ability to create a superb picture without following normal display expectations. Take sunlight viewability, for example. At 850 nits, you'd expect this to be difficult to see in the sunlight. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> hits 3300 nits to ensure it's nice and bright, for instance, but you'll quickly learn that the problem wasn't brightness all along. It was glare.</p><p>Outdoor visibility comes with an interesting caveat, though. It's super easy to see in direct sunlight, but only if the sun isn't directly reflecting off the matte surface. I'm writing this at 3 pm, sitting in my car while I wait to pick my son up from school, and it's incredibly easy to see. It's also excellent for dashboard navigation. But if I were trying to type this up on my back deck with the sun overhead, I'd have to hold it at an angle.</p><p>That angle is the only really weird thing about this display, as the matte layer will completely occlude the display if the sun is shining straight into your vision. It's not a huge deal since you only have to <em>slightly</em> adjust the angle — you would never keep the sun directly on any other display, either — but it does look different from a normal reflective display. I would recommend using the scheduled light/dark theme option to keep light mode on during the day if you spend a lot of time outside, as that also makes a huge difference for visibility.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVOPiZ1yTJI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Elsewhere, the brightness level is simply brilliant and always feels comfortable. It can even get down to 2 nits when extra dim display is enabled, something that was a problem with previous generations of NXTPAPER. I've always found these displays to be too bright to read in bed at night, but the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra fixes all that.</p><p>The best part is that it achieves this with <strong>zero</strong> flicker, unlike OLED. That's because OLED normally has to switch to PWM dimming when you get to lower dimming levels, creating an uncomfortable flicker that can cause headaches and eye pain. Not something you want right before bed.</p><p>This phone is completely flicker-free and never uses PWM dimming at any time. It's true voltage-adjusted DC dimming, and it's one of the strengths of this display tech.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-settings"><span>Eye comfort settings</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7q2XWUQDkjUcrcfkNt5KYh" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-layer-stack-render" alt="TCL NXTPAPER technology screen layer visual." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7q2XWUQDkjUcrcfkNt5KYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>NXTPAPER 4.0 features a built-in blue light filter that performs exceptionally well. Additionally, the phone features two automated modes that adjust the display's color temperature to match the time of day or automatically based on ambient light temperature. You can enable both modes at the same time, if you like.</p><p>Since the screen doesn't use PWM dimming, there's no need to have any kind of flicker reduction option. By default, however, the phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to adjust display colors and to create more accurate grey colors. Turning off all three options under NXTVISION display settings reduces the amount of dithering system-wide.</p><p>Sticking to normal and black & white ink modes ensures the least amount of dithering, and using sRGB or Natural color space options seems to disable dithering entirely when NXTVISION is disabled. The phone's Color Paper display mode seems to dither no matter what options are selected.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AfD3BFUTjoiaC6GEF3PYcQ" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-matte-screen" alt="A light prism reflecting off the matte layer on the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfD3BFUTjoiaC6GEF3PYcQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TCL features a notable number of additional eye care features found under the NXTPAPER zone menu.

Switching takes a few seconds and is accompanied by a beautiful animation to show the progress.</p><p>NXTPAPER devices have always had these three options, so they're no different visually from those. Normal mode is what you expect: a full-color experience that looks like a modern smartphone display. Color Paper makes all the whites a warm, off-white color and changes most colors to pastel. Ink Paper makes everything black and white.</p><p>A fourth mode, Max Ink mode, uses the black & white visual appearance of Ink Paper mode but closes all apps except for the ones you whitelist. The idea here is to not only save battery life but also to act as a "digital detox" mode for when you need downtime or want to be less distracted.</p><p>As with the "reading modes" or "e-book modes" on some phones, these modes just alter the color of the display. They don't adjust the backlight itself or change the nature of the display itself, so they're not quite the same as using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">an E Ink phone</a> for eye care.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motion-resolution-viewing-angles"><span>Motion, resolution, viewing angles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S6vy3GeKTXRNfuXy6d6paQ" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-black-levels" alt="A look at the black levels of the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra using dark mode in Discord" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S6vy3GeKTXRNfuXy6d6paQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra's display automatically swaps between 120Hz and 60Hz, but you can select to keep it at 60Hz for battery or eye comfort reasons. At 7.2 inches, this massive display looks a little soft with 2340 x 1080 resolution.</p><p>I don't think the display looks traditionally low-resolution, which normally infers that you can see the individual pixels or that edges of icons and text have a stair-stepping pattern to them. Everything here is clean and clear, it's just softer than you might expect because of the additional light scattering and matte filters above the panel.</p><p>Lastly, we'll take a look at some of the traditionally weakest points of LCDs: motion blur, viewing angles, and black levels. Viewing angles and black levels are downright spectacular and are the best I've ever seen on an IPS-based display. Most of the time, I can't tell the difference between the black levels on this display and an OLED, although OLED continues to have better overall contrast.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CBqWFNmirqP7eSy6Tbxh4S" name="tcl-nxtpaper-60-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-viewing-angles" alt="Comparing viewing angles with a bright wallpaper on the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CBqWFNmirqP7eSy6Tbxh4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When using the phone to scroll in dark mode or in low light, you'll be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and a high-quality OLED panel. Most OLEDs tend to "bleed purple" when you slowly scroll in low light or in dark mode, and that effect is equivalent to the slight motion blur you'll see from the slower-refreshing pixels of NXTPAPER's IPS base.</p><p>That difference becomes more readily apparent when using light mode or when the backlight is turned up brighter, especially when scrolling with black text on a light background. This effect is less apparent in videos or while gaming.</p><p>In short, motion resolution is worse than OLED but better than a traditional IPS display. I can easily read words as I scroll, even if I flick the screen quickly, so I would still rate this as "good" even if it's not the best.</p><h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict</h2><p>The TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra has one of the most incredible displays I've ever used on a smartphone. It's fully flicker-free and offers relief for both people sensitive to PWM dimming and dithering, something that's simply unheard of in 2025 when phones either use some form of dithering or PWM-style dimming, which both introduce flicker to the experience.</p><p>NXTPAPER 4.0 also breaks from expectations of LCDs, offering superb black levels and viewing angles, excellent color reproduction, and tons of eye care modes. Outdoor visibility is still the weakest point of the experience, but it is significantly better than any previous NXTPAPER display by a wide margin. It's not hard to see in sunlight, but it's not as easy as E Ink or some OLED displays.</p><p>The overall appearance of the display is incredibly captivating thanks to a combination of several bespoke visual filters and a matte surface, giving it a unique look and feel. Readability is much better on this display than most, and I found myself entranced by the display over the past week. It's gorgeous to look at, and ushers in a new era for IPS displays and TCL as a new quality contender.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="54d20a26-b090-4559-bd2e-ce372247d2a0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrtZBDCaBLATEkpdKWLXBJ.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra black colorway"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With eye comfort at its core, the TCL NXTPAPER 60 Ultra is the best choice for anyone concerned about eye health without sacrificing visual quality.

This much-requested feature is now live across Android, iOS, and the web.</p><p>The update supports MP3, M4A, and WAV files. Once you upload, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will transcribe the audio, pull out the key points, and give you a clear summary (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/gemini-audio-upload/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This feature can be accessed via the plus menu on Gemini’s mobile app or “Upload files” on the web. Once you upload an audio clip, the app analyzes it, turning meetings, interviews, lectures, or voice notes into easy-to-digest summaries and key takeaways.</p><h2 id="top-user-request-comes-to-life-2">Top user request comes to life</h2><p>Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward/status/1965057589718499756?s=19" target="_blank">shared on X</a> that this has been the feature users have asked for the most.</p><p>However, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14903178" target="_blank">support page</a>, you can upload up to 10 audio files at once, but their combined length can’t exceed 10 minutes. Other Gemini usage limits still apply, so keep that in mind before sending a batch of files.</p><p>The audio upload limits aren’t infinite but are fairly generous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-likely-to-get-video-analysis-feature-via-google-search-app">compared to video</a>. Free users get 10 minutes for audio, which is double the five-minute video cap. Meanwhile, paid users get three times the one-hour video limit.</p><p>Another limit to keep in mind is the file count. You can upload up to 10 files per prompt, and this covers everything from code folders with up to 5,000 files to GitHub repos and ZIPs with up to 10 compressed files. The new audio feature counts toward this 10-file total, so it doesn’t expand the overall limit.</p><p>Beyond transcription, Gemini can highlight key points, distinguish speakers, and pull out action items or quotes. This, in turn, makes any audio file a neatly structured, searchable document.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company introduced many new features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, Magic Cue, and more, but one of the most interesting additions was the Daily Hub. However, it looks like Google has temporarily pulled the feature from the Pixel 10.</p><p>Google issued a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/pixel-10-daily-hub-pause/">9to5Google</a> saying that to ensure the best possible experience, it is "temporarily pausing" the public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-enable-and-use-daily-hub">preview of Daily Hub</a> for users.

It works like a hub where users can see their daily events, weather information, reminders, and even things like bills from Gmail. For some users, the Daily Hub even pulled up some relevant notes from Google Keep.</p><p>In addition to this, Google also includes media recommendations from apps you've opted into (with information pulled from Google TV), as well as suggestions from YouTube and YouTube Music. The Daily Hub essentially acts like a digital newspaper that updates in real time and surfaces content relevant to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, while promising in theory, the feature has been hit or miss.

It was supposed to show at the top of the Discover feed and in At a Glance on the homescreen.</p><p>Now Google has completely paused the feature. The company hasn't said when the Daily Hub will return on Pixel 10 phones, but we expect only a brief delay before its comeback. We'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more from the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That’s a jump from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>’s f/3.4, meaning it should capture more light and handle low-light shots better.</p><p>Ice Universe also states the S26 Ultra's 200MP main sensor will get a wider aperture, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-could-make-taking-night-shots-a-lot-more-effortless">reiterating a previous statement</a>. On Weibo, the leaker called it Samsung's most significant camera upgrade since the Galaxy S20 Ultra, one that should dramatically improve its low-light capabilities and overall image quality.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The upgrade of the Samsung S26 Ultra camera may not be worth mentioning for the Chinese Ultra, but it is a significant improvement for the S25 Ultra. pic.twitter.com/x0frRoZ0Zr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1964226547143102865">September 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="bigger-apertures-brighter-shots-2">Bigger apertures, brighter shots</h2><p>A wider aperture excels in low light as it lets the sensor pull in significantly more light, brightening shots and allowing for a faster shutter. This combination is key to sharper, clearer images with less motion blur, whether you're shooting at night or in a dim room.</p><p>As per the new rumor, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s main camera could soak up 47% more light than the S25 Ultra, while its 5x telephoto lens might pull in 38% more.</p><p>Meanwhile, the aging 10MP sensor on the 3x telephoto lens is set to be swapped for a 12MP unit. The new Samsung S5K3LD sensor should pack around 20% more pixels than the S25 Ultra’s version.</p><p>Additionally, a wider aperture also gives a shallower depth of field, letting portraits show off smoother, more natural bokeh. That means less reliance on software tricks, which can sometimes feel fake.</p><p>None of these upgrades alone wow, but combined, they’re set to make Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">top-tier Galaxy phone</a> a low-light powerhouse, outperforming its predecessors with sharper and brighter shots.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The leak also revisits the phone’s folding action, matching earlier details from the same source, so there's nothing shocking here.</p><p>The animation suggests this unusual placement was likely chosen to give the best selfie previews using the main cameras, positioned to the viewer’s left.</p><p>Other whispers about the tri-fold point to a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset. The phone is clearly aiming high, and likely costing just as much.</p><p>Some leaks hint that Samsung’s first tri-fold might launch in select markets first, holding off a full global rollout until 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The bezels around the display are slimmer, which makes the screen look larger, and the slightly domed display pushes even closer against the outer glass, making the UI feel better to interact with. Wear OS 6 looks vibrant and fresh, and the new Material 3 Expressive design makes interactions fun.</p><p>The power bump is welcomed on the Pixel Watch 4 thanks to the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 SoC. You get on-device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> capabilities like smart replies to messages and a Raise-to-Talk feature. The Watch 4 is also the first commercially available smartwatch to have satellite SOS connectivity. The faster charging and significant battery boost are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/should-you-buy-the-google-pixel-watch-4">big reasons to upgrade</a> to the Pixel Watch 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U" name="Pixel-Watch-4-charging" alt="Pixel Watch on the side mounted charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDUk5NuKthHYQuvFSwge8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, in Matte Black or Polished Silver. You can also get the 41mm variant in Champagne Gold and the 45mm in Satin Moonstone. Prices start at $349 or $449 for the Wi-Fi and LTE versions, respectively. The 45mm variant gets a $50 bump in price for the individual variants. If you've been holding off on upgrading your Pixel Watch 2, now would be a good time to trade it in for the Watch 4.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google reportedly changed the shortcut URL for AI Mode, dropping the full name for google.com/ai.</li><li>The company also changed its main app shortcut, moving AI Mode's colorful icon out of the search box, and placing it under it next to voice and Lens.</li><li>In July, AI Mode's update brought the ability for users to lean on it to call businesses to schedule appointments.</li></ul><p>Google's restructured its owned URLs in regards to AI Mode in Search, which may open the doors for more to come.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/05/google-ai-mode-new-link/">9to5Google</a> highlighted a recent change by the company, as it's now sending users to a new place for AI Mode. It notes that Google has changed its old AI Mode (google.com/aimode) to a much simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=50&aep=11">google.com/ai</a> URL. There's nothing else different with this change. The main takeaway is the "shortcut" to get there has changed, presumably to help people remember and get there faster, as you're not forced to remember the name of the feature—just AI.</p><p>The publication speculates that this change could signal more to come from Google, as its URL is shortened simply to AI.</p><p>It makes sense; if Google has created a much broader AI link, which, for now, takes users to Search's AI Mode, more of its software could end up here as new tabs or overhead links. Elsewhere, the publication discovered that Google has shifted its AI Mode icon within its main app on Android and iOS.</p><p>Now, users won't find the colorful icon <em>in </em>the search box. Instead, it's placed beneath it, alongside the voice query button and the Lens icon. It's unclear why Google changed this, as the colorful AI Mode icon is still within the search box in new Chrome tabs on Android.</p><h2 id="opening-the-doors-for-more-ai-2">Opening the doors for more AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC" name="ai-mode-google-search-io2025" alt="AI Mode at I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeuUXekPFJHWXNgugsDGyC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1580" height="889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI Mode has had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">pretty productive year so far</a>, in terms of bringing new features to users interested in the software. During I/O, Google announced the "Deep Search" feature for AI Mode, which users should now see more frequently whenever AI Overviews appear during a query. The purpose of this is to allow the AI to give you a more "in-depth" response about a topic, helping you to understand those nitty-gritty details.</p><p>It's a feature that enables the AI to scour multiple websites and do all the heavy research for you, before delivering a "comprehensive" overview of everything to your benefit. At I/O, Google said AI Mode's Deep Search goes through "hundreds of websites" and uses its ability to draw conclusions and more to help you with harder topics and things you want to learn more about.</p><p>In July, Google updated AI Mode again, but that came with the ability for it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">to place phone calls for you</a>.

The company confirms that the product will debut on September 18. There's no word on a planned event (such as something that's livestreamed) or anything else. The company's website doesn't have any promotional material posted just yet, either.</p><p>We're a little over a week away from when these buds launch, so maybe we're still awaiting more from Nothing's teaser engine.</p><p>However, the snapshot provided still keeps most of the device masked in secrecy. We get another look at the "Ear 3" branding on the side of what could be the buds' stabilizer (stem), as the publication theorizes.

Aside from the Ear 3 name, the post on X said we should expect the product "soon." The company also delivered an up-close shot of the product's Ear 3 branding. We mentioned last time that it feels like we're "due" for another Nothing Ear release, as, in 2024, we had the Nothing Ear Open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">launch in September</a>.</p><p>This was a shift from the company's typical standard earbud products, as it deployed an Open earbud design that hooks around your ear.</p><p>The Nothing Ear, part of the brand's naming shift, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-ear-a-confirmation">launched in April 2024</a>. It seems these new Ear 3 buds will follow that design with silicone tips, a stabilizer stem, and more. It's unclear what major features the new pair will debut with. There's a chance the buds could play nice with its recent AI suite on its flagship Nothing Phone 3. Perhaps users can record voice notes using their buds and interact with their handheld even more just by touching the buds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The September patch lets users "add widgets to the home screen in the Samsung DeX mode." The notes mention that users can add widgets like a calendar, clock, or "decorative" images. A user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1965030576962093374">X also spotted the change</a>, showcasing what it will look like once users receive it.</p><p>On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Samsung's security side</a>, both foldables are receiving a heavy dose of "High" level security fixes, as well as two critical software fixes. The critical fixes are something Google mentions in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-09-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> for September. One of the fixes for CVE-2025-48539 regards an Android System fix. The other, CVE-2025-27034, is a critical fix for a Qualcomm closed-source component vulnerability.</p><h2 id="foldables-in-the-news-2">Foldables in the news</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCR4LwvFKyXbcje4Rk9AaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Vats states on X, this update is rolling out for users in South Korea as of today (Sep 8).

It's been reported that Samsung is changing up its production plans for the Fold 7 in September, looking to produce 260,000 new units, instead of 200,000 like it originally planned. We can't say we're surprised, as reports from South Korea showed that the Fold 7 was incredibly popular during its pre-order phase, beating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The Flip model, in the past, was typically the one people leaned toward.

Starting with the former, you get a physical SIM card slot on the OnePlus 13, so you can just push your SIM in and start using the device. On the Pixel 10 Pro XL in the U.S., you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">only get an eSIM option</a>.</p><p>In terms of durability, technically, the OnePlus 13 is more durable than the Pixel 10 Pro XL thanks to its dual IP68 + IP69 rating, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL only carries IP68 dust and water resistance. Both phones can handle occasional rain and even short underwater video capture, but the OnePlus is also rated against high-pressure, high-temperature water jet sprays.

One of the biggest in my book is the IP68 rating for dust and waterproofing. No other foldable has managed to achieve this level of rating yet, making the 10 Pro Fold the first to do it. The best we've had so far is an IP48 rating, which debuted with Samsung's foldables in 2024.</p><p>The other big change is the Tensor G5 chip, which unlocks more advanced on-device AI capabilities and performance. The latter is still not quite up to par with the competition, as we found out in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10 review</a>. The addition of magnets underneath the back panel of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold makes it the first foldable to natively support Qi2 wireless charging. Google calls this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, but it's essentially a way to use any MagSafe accessories directly with the 10 Pro Fold, without a case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is currently one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around.

Prices start at $1,799 for the base 16GB/256GB configuration, and the storage goes up to 1TB.</p><p>One impressive fact about the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that Google claims it can "handle over 10 years of folding." Google is confident about its new gearless hinge and the other durability improvements made to the folding display. The phone also has a sizeable battery which should easily let it last for more than a day on one charge. We'll be putting the 10 Pro Fold through our rigorous review process and will have the final verdict on whether it's worth it or not very soon.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ac4ab0b-8126-448d-abbe-166125a85d72">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Folding like a champ</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the latest flagship from Google, sporting improved durability, an IP68 rating, Pixelsnap charging, and a more powerful Tensor chip than ever before.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

We've also seen companies like Apple, Samsung, and Strava add AI coaching options for their products.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai" target="_blank">AI software</a> in the fitness space is only one piece of the puzzle. Hardware companies are also developing new wearable concepts with AI at the core. To get an idea of where we're at and where we're headed, I tested Samsung's Running Coach software and Hypershell's X Ultra exoskeleton hardware at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2025</a> in Berlin, Germany.</p><p>As an amateur distance runner, I wanted to find out if adding AI to my training could really help. Here's how it went.</p><h2 id="personal-trainers-aren-t-going-anywhere-yet-2">Personal trainers aren't going anywhere... yet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-2" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oy7xT72as4NSUyCFXsV8K6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung debuted Running Coach alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, and our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">wearables expert Michael Hicks put it through its paces</a>. His experience was less-than-stellar, as Running Coach underestimated his abilities. That got me wondering whether a more amateur runner like myself would be a better fit for the software.</p><p>At Samsung's mobile devices booth at IFA 2025, I filled out a quick survey about my sleep and running habits, and was then given a slip with my running level and a QR code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6" name="Samsung-Running-Sleep-Test" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoEPz2HRdCFLDwtCH47Ws6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, I still ran into Running Coach limitations. The feature is built around fixed goals that are linked to your running level — I got Level 5 after the quick survey at IFA — with little room for personalization.</p><p>I think this strategy is a mistake, because it makes Running Coach too centered upon the goal of finishing a race length you may not be interested in. Additionally, when you reach a goal, you simply move to the next level without much focus on being able to complete those distances during training on a week-to-week basis.</p><p>For instance, the Level 5 training plan has me trying to finish a 10K under 1:08:20 (11:00/mile) — something I can already do. I can't tell Running Coach that I'm trying to cut my 5K time rather than build up to longer distances, or that I'd rather gain the strength to run five times per week before scaling distances. This seems like something that would be easy enough for Samsung to add with a few extra survey questions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7" name="Big-Galaxy-Watch-8-AI-Running-1" alt="A supersized Galaxy Watch 8 showing off Running Coach at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYuDhvgSzTmZdxHoKRFcK7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll skip using Running Coach for my own training plan for now, but using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> on the Galaxy Watch 8 has actually been a big help.

It's a device that straps onto your waist and thighs, featuring a motor on each side for lifting your legs robotically. I admit I was skeptical, and it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but it's real, and it's called the Hypershell X Ultra.</p><p>The company explained that its goal is to enhance human capabilities. The $2,000 exoskeleton utilizes AI and machine learning to anticipate your next move and provide motorized assistance accordingly. It uses data from more than 12 sensors and its AI MotionEngine Ultra, built on training data, to adjust to your individual stride signature. No one walks the same way, and that's why AI and ML are necessary.</p><p>The device connects to an Android app and is designed for physical activities, like walking, hiking, and running.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT" name="Hypershell-X-Plus-App" alt="The Hypershell X Plus app running on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NeLCAmU8y4ZkVfN7erFaJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's something you really need to <em>feel</em> to believe, but the motorized exoskeleton actually does help lift your leg up in alignment with your stride to reduce exertion.

Not because the device doesn't work, but you still need to build cardiovascular endurance to run well.</p><p>Additionally, my short sprints with Hypershell revealed that the waistband slightly limited my mobility. The gain in power you get from wearing the exoskeleton might be countered by less efficient running mechanics.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vz5jqP8oVMGiDgBoTCHjL" name="Hypershell-X-Ultra-7" alt="The Hypershell X Ultra exoskeleton on my left leg." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vz5jqP8oVMGiDgBoTCHjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't see people wearing exoskeletons to beat their PRs, without even getting into the "cheating" debate. However, I <em>do</em> see runners potentially using exoskeletons for training. Fitness mode on the Hypershell X Ultra turns the motors<em> against</em> you, making it harder for you to run at your normal pace. It can also reduce impact stress while going downhill, possibly lessening knee and joint pain.</p><p>It might sound like torture, but advanced runners already do this with devices like speed parachutes. Personally, I find exoskeletons to be a more elegant solution for resistance training, and I'd definitely use a Hypershell in Fitness mode to intensify my training.</p><h2 id="ai-hardware-vs-software-2">AI hardware vs. software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iKJosySRY5cLpYmygL6MJW" name="Hypershell-X-Ultra-9" alt="A man wearing Hypershell X Ultra at IFA 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iKJosySRY5cLpYmygL6MJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI software tools are more accessible to runners than hardware exoskeletons, but I find the latter to be a more exciting training companion. AI running coaches simply don't provide enough personalization options, while the hardware can elevate your training while literally personalizing the experience in real time using AI and ML algorithms. I'd never use it in a race, but I do think it can help you become a better runner.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Hypershell provided travel and lodging for part of my trip to IFA, but had no input in this article. </em></p> ]]></dc:content>
