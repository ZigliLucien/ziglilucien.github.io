At this time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has chopped 40% off the price of the Fire TV Stick 4K</strong></a>, bringing it down to just under $30.</p><p>The appeal of a Fire Stick isn't hard to see for most: it simply requires the user to plug the transmitter into their HDMI port, log into their Wi-Fi, and boom, they can start streaming from their favorite services.</p><p>This plug-and-play model can also access high-resolution streaming with the 4K, 4K Max Fire TV Stick, and Fire TV Cube models. On the other hand, users who don't need 4K can actually save a few extra bucks on the HD model, which still supports 1080p streaming.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025"><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see FAQ and deal predictions</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:756px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kR7PMGRqWxzmNyq3ju4aj8" name="amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-2021.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kR7PMGRqWxzmNyq3ju4aj8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="756" height="756" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.99</del> <strong>$29.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is currently selling its 4K Fire TV Stick for $20 off the normal sticker price, representing a 40% discount. For those in the market for a quick, easy streaming solution on a 4K TV, $30 isn't a bad price, and it's hard to argue with the convenience of Amazon's Fire TV Sticks.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a simple plug-and-play streaming solution for your 4K TV; you want a TV system with easy access to Alexa voice commands, Xbox gaming, and other modern features; you have credentials for streaming services such as Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, or others, and you want to simply log into these apps and start watching.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd rather upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> or Fire TV Cube, or you don't want 4K picture quality; your TV doesn't support 4K resolution, and you'd rather save a few extra dollars by going with the Fire TV Stick HD; you need a device that can play DVDs or other physical media.</p><p>The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers basic 4K streaming on compatible TVs, and it holds up as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-fire-tv-stick">best Fire TV Stick </a>out there for its appeal to most mid-level buyers. Just like most of Amazon's other devices in the lineup, you can just plug it straight into your TV and start watching through your favorite streaming services. The remote offers hands-free voice commands with Alexa, making it easy to control playback, volume, and even smart home devices through the unit.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K comes with 8GB of onboard storage for apps and 2GB of RAM, which is just as much as the other premium options, but more than Amazon's HD model.</p><p>It utilizes Wi-Fi 6, and it offers cloud gaming via Amazon Luna and Xbox Game Pass. It's also compatible with Dolby Atmos audio, and includes video features such as Dolby Vision and the latest versions of HDR.</p><p>Overall, it's definitely best saved for those who actually have a 4K TV, but if you do fall into that category, $30 should come as a tempting offer at which to access that level of high-res streaming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I can't blame anyone, while not much was really said, a lot was implied in an attempt to build hype from a master of building hype. The plan worked exactly as intended.</p><p>There are a few "real" hints at Nothing's future in Pei's forum post. Nothing will have a new product this fall. Nothing was able to get a handful of companies that often make investments they know won't pan out to give him some money. Nothing has shipped "millions" of devices in four years. And Nothing knows it has to get on the AI train while it's the current trend. Pei hints that the company wants to do it a bit differently.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing OS 4.0 Refined. Redefined. Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/496fufxV0f<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1965701874927210751">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Pei never said he was building a new OS from the ground up, even if it sounds that way. He said, "<em>The next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us,</em>" and to me, that can only mean one thing: Nothing is going to try its hand at building its own AI suite rather than partnering with another company. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Think Samsung</a>, not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Motorola</a>.</p><p>Regardless, Android Central has reached out to Nothing for clarification on its plans and what its "AI OS" is, and will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="the-hard-truth-2">The hard truth</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the truth is, and I'll be blunt, if devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> were what consumers wanted to buy, Apple and Samsung/Google would be making them. Even then, the Rabbit was just another Android presented in a way that didn't seem like an Android. Instead, Apple and Samsung are building AI into the OS one chunk at a time at a pace they can manage without breaking everything.</p><p>There's another truth to think about, especially when it comes to smartphones. You have two options <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-android-replacement-os-will-start-rolling-out-june">outside of China</a>: Android or the graveyard where good things go once they have died. Look for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facepalm">webOS</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-you-wish-windows-phone-still-existed">Windows Phone</a> logos on the tombstones to know you've found it. People do not want something that doesn't offer at least as much as what they are used to having. When it comes to a phone, that means a million apps and the infrastructure to keep adding more features.</p><p>Pei and every other CEO in the mobile business know this. I don't know what Nothing's AI OS will be like, but I know it will likely be based on Android, with access to the Google suite of mobile services and the Play Store. What I'm hoping to see are products that "talk" and "learn" from each other.</p><h2 id="the-vision-2">The vision</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine having a Nothing AI OS account and using it for several devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">your phone</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">headphones</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>, or anything "smart." What you do on one device can affect what happens on the others without you making any decisions if they are tied together well. It could need to be incredibly intrusive when it comes to your privacy, but whoever does it the right way first will be ahead of the game once everyone else figures it out.</p><p>I think this is what Nothing is shooting for: an Android-powered OS on every device it sells, from smartphones to smart glasses, with AI and smarts baked in so that it all works together. It's the same thing Samsung, Google, Apple, Xiaomi, and everyone else are working towards. Nothing is small enough, maneuverable enough, and bold enough to go for it where other companies must be more cautious.</p><p>Nothing isn't likely to make the next Rabbit R1 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">Humane AI Pin</a>, and probably has no plans to try it. Nothing wants to make the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> in a way that works better with the Pixel 10 version of a watch or earbuds. Smart devices being smarter together would be the next breakthrough we keep hearing about.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While most user-facing changes shipped earlier with Android 16 QPR1, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a>, Android 16 QPR2 is set to bring two major UI changes: forced dark mode and auto-themed app icons.</p><p>Forced dark mode, as the name suggests, will implement dark mode in apps that don't support it natively. On the other hand, auto-themed app icons have existed in Android for some time, but Google hasn't forced developers to make their icons compatible. This has resulted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-material-you-adaptive-icon-pack-icon-pack-studio">poor user experience</a>, with some icons supporting Material You theming while others look out of place.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16 QPR2</a> will aim to fix this by forcing all app icons to adopt the system's theme. Google says the new icon theming engine applies a color-filtering algorithm that renders app icons in a monochrome style, making them consistent with the chosen theme.</p><p>Google is now formally notifying developers as well. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-icon-theming-agreement-3597899/">Android Authority</a>, starting October 15 for existing developers, revisions to Google Play's Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) section 5.3 will take effect, stating that users will be allowed "permission to modify colors or adjust themes of apps.".</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.34%;"><img id="ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D" name="google-play-rule-change" alt="Google Play rule changes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ohUceg9WKbmmSAvU7SUE8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2650" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With this change, Google aims to help both users and developers avoid potential conflicts, such as issues with modifying a brand's icon. For new developers, the rules already went into effect on September 15, 2025.</p><p>This change also seems necessary for Google to protect itself from takedown notices from brands and developers. Still, it's great to see Google finally taking steps to improve icon theming on Android.</p><p>Apple did something similar with iOS 18, but even though Google implemented universal icon theming earlier, it's only now being properly and fully enforced.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Essentially, it is designed to automate tedious tasks on the phone, allowing the user sufficient time to focus on what matters to them on the device.</p><p>He also goes on to say that, unlike most OS available today, Nothing's new OS will be unique to the user, meaning that "a billion different operating systems will be rendered for a billion different people," Pei added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LmLKWkoSF7M3Wjt6Rp3iMR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmLKWkoSF7M3Wjt6Rp3iMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In his "vision" for the company, Pei believes that new hardware is crucial for really unlocking AI's full potential, especially since smartphones haven't kept pace with AI's quick progress.

While totally respectable for a normal fitness watch, it's on the low end for the Instinct series.</p><p>That said, its 29 GPS hours of tracking actually beats the original Crossover (25 hours), though its 15 hours of multi-band tracking loses to the 50mm Instinct 3 (30 hours).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Xr2LdTbLpwmP8To4e3J3f9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-hiking-photo" alt="A photo of a person hiking with a heavy pack while wearing the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xr2LdTbLpwmP8To4e3J3f9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The original Crossover's 0.9-inch monocolor display was nothing to write home about, automatically truncating notifications and widgets to accommodate the lower resolution.</p><p>This AMOLED hybrid still relies on button controls instead of touch, but gives you the space to make things readable, even with the watch hands taking up space. And you get sapphire glass instead of basic "chemically strengthened" protection, along with the new flashlight and upgraded GPS accuracy.</p><p>“From a day on the hiking trail to a night on the town, Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers the best of both worlds," says Garmin VP Susan Lyman.</p><p>The Instinct Crossover AMOLED offers a more classic style than the Instinct 3, with a steel bezel instead of aluminum and vibrant hands that are easy to see in any environment. Garmin promises that its RevoDrive tech will "detect and recalibrate misaligned hands" so you always know the correct time; it's something they offered in the original Crossover.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-night-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch on a person's arm at night." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDnabtyTWtk38E8g7XqAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the specs sheet, the Instinct Crossover AMOLED weighs 67g with 15mm thickness, slightly heavier than the Instinct 3 but with a similar bulky design.</p><p>Garmin is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1800201/">Instinct Crossover AMOLED at $649</a> in two colorways: charcoal and bronze/ sunburst.

This new feature is all about making it easier and more affordable for women to really understand how their lifestyle choices impact their cycle.</p><p>This partnership aims at syncing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring AIR </a>with Clue, which allows users to automatically import up to six months of their cycle history from Clue directly into the Ultrahuman app, instead of switching between two apps to look for their health data.</p><p>The company says that the combined real-time data from Ultrahuman such as skin temperature, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, along with cycle tracking information from Clue will allow users to see how their menstrual cycle phases correlate with their activity levels, sleep patterns, giving them a clear picture as to how different factors impact their cycle and if they need to take action to improve health.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGwc3XauVdb6Te4yVztBU7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"This combined view provides women with a broader picture of their health, bringing together cycle patterns and daily biomarkers in one place," Ultrahuman stated in its press release. This only makes it easier for women to notice connections between, let's say, sleep patterns and how their period is either on time or delayed, reflect on health goals, and adapt routines in ways that feel aligned with their bodies.</p><p>As for how this works, the ring tracks the body's biomarkers and tracks how the body also reacts differently during various cycle phases—such as the follicular and luteal phases—which can affect energy levels, mood, and resilience. For example, a user might see how their skin temperature and resting heart rate increase during the luteal phase, which can help them correlate these and make changes to their routines if needed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6" name="Ultrahuman-air-clue-collab" alt="Ultrahuman partners with Clue to give woman better cycle tracking insights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMbFcnXZmgNNjUqpxompe6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, users will also be able to record the intensity of cramps and mood swings with the Clue Plus subscription, and see how they connect with Ultrahuman Ring's recovery and temperature insights. This kind of tracking is helpful for women of all ages, whether they're trying to track their period, fertility, get pregnancy insights, or perimenopause guidance.</p><p>Lastly, every purchase of the Ultrahuman Ring AIR now includes a full year of Clue Plus for $9.99 – reduced from $39.99. This subscription also provides extended 12-month forecasting and expert-backed guidance from clinicians to help users better understand their bodies. And for those who already own an Ultrahuman Ring Air, the company says it is working to get you access to Clue Plus at a special price in the near future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3311906c-1cb2-4380-8f0e-f5e825a485bd">            <a href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/us/" data-model-name="Ultrahuman Ring Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWmpt8LYymbGiqxuSRfTcZ.jpg' alt="Close-up render of the Aster Black Ultrahuman Ring Air"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ultrahuman Ring Air</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="70" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Blending in</strong></em></p><p>Do you dislike the feeling of something on your wrist while sleeping?

I had UniFi cameras previously, and while I like what Ubiquiti does with its products, lack of integration with Google Home and Home Assistant was a deal-breaker. That's why I went with Nest; I wanted cameras that would be easy-to-use and tied in with Google Home.</p><p>While it was annoying to buy Nest Aware just to be able to access footage from my cameras, I did so because of the convenience, even when Google hiked the price to $80 a year in 2023. But with another round of hikes — with the plan now going up to $100 — I decided to move to another platform.</p><p>I needed three things: strong focus on privacy, local access, and an easy way to power the devices. I had to rule out Eufy and most other Chinese brands because of previous vulnerabilities or lack of transparency, and finally landed on Reolink. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-is-the-only-local-storage-security-camera-i-trust-and-its-at-an-all-time-low-right-now">tested the Argus 4</a> in the past, but my unit had issues with battery life — more so than the Nest Cam Outdoor — so I wasn't able to use it outdoors.</p><p>Given that I didn't want to deal with the hassle of charging the security cameras, I wanted a model that was powered by PoE or wall outlet. Thankfully, Reolink's Elite Floodlight fit my needs ideally; the camera has 180-degree coverage thanks to two lenses, and as the name suggests, it has built-in lighting to illuminate its surroundings at night.</p><p>It comes with local storage via a MicroSD slot, and there's no monthly or annual fee. Best of all, I was able to integrate it easily into my network video recorder, giving me the ability to view the camera feed from anywhere. I used the Elite Floodlight for just over three months now, and it has been nothing short of excellent.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoKbLqw6suGEtPCQXFKX7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Image quality is clean and detailed, and the camera does a great job stitching footage from the dual lenses. I didn't see any issues with low-light footage either, and the built-in floodlight gets incredibly bright (going up to 3000 lumen) at its highest setting.</p><p>It has good connectivity over Wi-Fi 6, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. By contrast, I had problems connecting to my Nest Cam Outdoor, and it would regularly glitch out when I pulled up the feed to view who's at the door. There are no such issues with the Elite Floodlight, and its motion detection along with zone intrusion alerts combined with local storage give it a definite edge.</p><p>I have the Elite Floodlight mounted outside the front door, and its IP66 ingress protection has proven to be reliable in India's monsoon weather. Setting it up was straightforward, and Reolink's mobile app is good in its own right. Best of all, as it delivers an RTSP stream, it's easy to link the camera to an NVR without any hassle.</p><p>In addition to the Elite Floodlight, I've been using the Atlas, a battery camera with a 2K lens and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The Atlas comes with a solar panel, alleviating the need to dismount it and charge the device. The Atlas misses out on RTSP, so I have it set up in a balcony that doesn't get much use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a" name="Reolink Argus" alt="Reolink Argus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/67WnGnEpa8bN3nCsuCYQ5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Reolink also has a cloud-based tier that lets you store footage, but given that its cameras have built-in MicroSD slots, I didn't see the point of leveraging the feature. While I generally don't like using MicroSD storage, it has been decent enough in the three months I used the Elite Floodlight and Atlas, and I didn't run into any issues. If you are interested in saving footage in the cloud, Reolink uses the industry-standard AES encryption when data is in transit.</p><p>The biggest reason I switched to Reolink cameras is the ease of access; it would take anywhere between five to 10 seconds to load the footage after pulling up the feed on my Nest cameras, and it's considerably faster on the Elite Floodlight and Atlas. I can view the feed within a few seconds. With the footage going out to my NVR, I'm able to store 24/7 recording for as long as I need (I set it to 90-day intervals).</p><p>Another positive with Reolink is the affordability. The Atlas c<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S">osts $135 as of writing</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH">Elite Floodlight available for $197 on Amazon</a>. Considering there's no fee to access footage, that's a pretty great value when you consider the rest of the feature-set.</p><p>With these cameras set up, I'm looking to get my hands on additional Reolink cameras; the brand makes PoE products as well, and that's what I'm interested in picking up next. Overall, Reolink has proven to be the ideal alternative to Nest, and the flexibility combined with the feature-set makes the brand my go-to recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="76caa940-cdac-4798-b127-1a2f3476cfa0">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Altas-Solar-Pre-Record-Subscription/dp/B0F1YGLF7S" data-model-name="Reolink Atlas" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:87.45%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pSfaZD6Wn59G4HcPk6d9A.jpg' alt="Reolink Atlas"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Atlas</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Atlas is a great starting point if you need a new camera; it has good coverage, the 2K lens delivers clean imagery, and it doesn't cost much. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="00c198c0-abec-43f0-9395-1d7407579a8d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Elite-Floodlight-WiFi-Adjustable/dp/B0DWSJVXJH" data-model-name="Reolink Elite Floodlight " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:67.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efN88bMijTgaExX4VgovLU.jpg' alt="Reolink Elite Floodlight "></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Reolink Elite Floodlight </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Elite Floodlight is my go-to choice if you need a camera with built-in illumination.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Pixels always had slower storage modules, with the Pixel 9 series coming with UFS 3.1 across the board when every other high-end phone included UFS 4.0. Thankfully, Google is finally changing its stance this year on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, with all models getting UFS 4.0 — provided you get the 256GB storage variant.</p><p>Interestingly, the Pro models get Zoned UFS (ZUFS) 4.0, a variant of UFS 4.0 that stores data more efficiently. Essentially, data on a ZUFS 4.0 module is catalogued and stored in distinct zones, and this leads to faster loading times and increased efficiency over the lifetime of the storage module.</p><p>With Google guaranteeing seven Android OS updates, going with ZUFS 4.0 is obviously the right move in ensuring the storage module doesn't degrade. There's just one problem; ZUFS isn't standard on all models. In fact, the 128GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro still uses the older UFS 3.1 storage, and it's annoying that Google isn't providing UFS 4.0 on all of its models. Even if you get the 256GB model, it comes with UFS 4.0 and not ZUFS, with that limited to the 512GB and 1TB models in the U.S.</p><p>Annoyingly, Google doesn't provide ZUFS in the 512GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL in the U.K. and other global markets — you'll need to get the 1TB model if you want the storage module. It would be nice if Google standardized access across its range — like every other phone manufacturer — but that clearly isn't the case. In countries like India, where Google only sells the 256GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, there's no way to upgrade to the ZUFS model.</p><p>I don't have a 512GB Pixel 10 Pro, so I'm unable to test its efficacy against the 256GB UFS 4.0 model, but I tested my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> against other phones that have UFS 4.0 storage, and found it to be on the lower end of the scale when it comes to sequential reads and writes. If anything, there's not a huge difference between the Pixel 10 Pro XL and last year's UFS 3.1-based Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it's likely Google is focusing on efficiency instead of raw numbers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4879px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvCA5GuuD5a85GCPGUyAs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4879" height="2748" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the case with the Tensor G5 as well, so it stands to reason that the storage situation is in line with Google's priorities instead of the industry standard. Even if there isn't a huge upgrade, moving to UFS 4.0 and ZUFS 4.0 puts the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro models in line with their immediate rivals, and while you may not see a tangible difference right now, it should be evident a few years down the line.</p><p>Should you buy the 512GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro just because of ZUFS 4.0? No. Get it if you need additional storage, and you see yourself taking a lot of photos and videos. Google is pushing users toward Google One plans as a way to manage excess storage, and I'm not a fan of using cloud storage — I'd like to be able to store all of my photos and videos on-device.</p><p>ZUFS 4.0 is just one of the ways Google is addressing long-standing issues with its devices, and combined with better cameras, more durable design, brighter OLED panels, and unique software features, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are proving to be among the best phones around.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7bd45214-8cdc-4a87-bdd5-18be1a68b1cf">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PxxDbVJ9FVx2Wvfu4QSSU3.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro has all the features you need; the cameras are even better, and it excels at zoom, going all the way up to 100x. The Tensor G5 is noticeably faster than last year, and it has better thermal management. Combine that with the software and brightest OLED panel of any phone, and the 10 Pro is a great all-rounder. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

If so, it's worth spending a little extra for something that works better for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-makes-other-tablets-too"><span>Samsung makes other tablets, too</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AZCp9s5ihThj4NsWhLzuzF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-tab-a9-plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="A hand on the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZCp9s5ihThj4NsWhLzuzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You know if you <em><strong>need</strong></em> a Galaxy Tab S11 or S11 Ultra. There are reasons why you might need the new features or the processing power. Most of us just want one.</p><p>Ask yourself why? You need to figure out what you will be using the tablet for before you spend a penny, because Ultra and Pro tablets are simply overkill for what most of us use a tablet for.</p><p>My wife uses a Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. I'm not big on tablets, but my mom got me an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebook-vs-ipads">iPad</a> for Christmas and I use it sometimes. I'm more of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-arent-everyone-and-thats-ok">Chromebook</a> fellow. But it's nice, and for doodling, the Tab S10 is far better than anything else I've tried. S Pen FTW. However, if I were buying a new tablet today, I'd buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus.</p><p>I'm never going to work using a tablet because the keyboard options are horrible. Compared to almost any laptop or Chromebook, Samsung and Apple make terrible tablet keyboards for typing or navigating through a spreadsheet.</p><p>I'm not going to carry a tablet around as a camera. I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">phone with a camera</a>. I have a "real" camera, too, if I wanted to carry it around.

The company is on schedule to spend $70 billion on AI investments in 2025 alone, but its decade-long investment of around the same amount into AR/VR research is the one about to pay off big time.</p><p>I'm talking, of course, about the upcoming launch of several new Ray-Ban and Oakley-branded smart glasses scheduled to be announced at Meta Connect 2025 on September 17 at 5 p.m. PT. Central to that is a new paradigm for smart glasses, seemingly called Ray-Ban Meta Display, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-gesture-input-spotted-early-in-alleged-promo-video">based on a new leak</a>. These glasses offer a true next-generation upgrade over existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Smart glasses</a>, but Meta isn't stopping there.</p><p>The company is also expected to announce a new line of Optical and Sunglasses Ray-Bans complete with Meta technology inside, in addition to an even sportier pair of Oakley smart glasses in the company's trademark Sphaera visor form factor. The company is seemingly going all-in on glasses from EssilorLuxottica brands, and it's just the beginning of what we're going to see from the partnership when they're likely to be unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> this week.</p><h2 id="brand-power-2">Brand power</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="PUapEJURywSxDXFcxfDrX6" name="oakley-meta-ray-ban-meta-connect-2025-leak" alt="The entire lineup of new Oakley and Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses as seen in a leaked, unlisted promotional video on Meta's YouTube channel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUapEJURywSxDXFcxfDrX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshots from a leaked promotional Meta YouTube video)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just this week, Amazon announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-tablet/new-devices-and-ai-upgrades-on-the-horizon-at-amazons-annual-fall-event">a new hardware event</a> at which they're expected to announce their own pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazons-ar-glasses-rival-to-ray-ban-meta-wont-work-unless-it-changes-tactics">next-generation Echo Frames</a>. These smart glasses are supposed to be a major upgrade on older audio-only Echo Frames, said to offer similar functionality to Ray-Ban Display glasses, including cameras and a display embedded in at least one of the lenses.</p><p>But the kicker is that they're rumored to cost $800, the same price tag as Ray-Ban Display glasses. Even assuming Amazon somehow packs more power and technology in their frames for the same price, I'm not sure I can see most consumers choosing Amazon-branded glasses over Ray-Bans, especially for that price.</p><p>This perfectly illustrates the place Meta has now found itself after years of promising investors that a proper return on their money is right around the corner. Miniaturizing technology enough to make an attractive pair of glasses has been an incredibly difficult venture, but it's clear Meta has impressed EssilorLuxottica enough to make an even more powerful pair, and I expect customers will also be impressed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.09%;"><img id="mCeHrMN2nqj5ib9jvKXCmC" name="ray-ban-meta-display-leak-maps" alt="Ray-Ban Meta Display smart glasses leaked turn-by-turn navigation feature on its lens-embedded display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mCeHrMN2nqj5ib9jvKXCmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot from a leaked Meta YouTube video)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Seeing this trend in action, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">is taking the same steps</a> to make smart glasses for popular eyewear brands. The company announced a partnership with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster earlier this summer. As someone who only started wearing glasses two years ago, I had never heard of these brands before Google's announcement, but I have certainly heard of Oakley and Ray-Ban since my childhood days.</p><p>Meta seems to have scooped up the right ones with universal appeal, and further rumor has it that the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">will be targeting Prada wearers next</a>, potentially with an even more expensive price tag to match the brand's pedigree.</p><p>The Devil might wear Prada, but so do all the other people with a ton of money, and Meta's position as the stylistic smart glasses brand will cement its legacy in a way I don't even think Mark Zuckerberg could have dreamed up just a few years ago.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update begins with its coveted Discover Weekly playlist, which updates every Monday. Spotify says users will find "a fresh mix of personalized recommendations every week based on what you’ve been listening to." More importantly, the more you use and listen to music on Spotify, the better it can "find the right tracks" for you.</p><p>Using Spotify more flows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-daylist-playlist">right into its daylist</a>. This unique playlist attempts to understand your listening habits during specific times of the day—throughout the week, as well—and develop a playlist for that. Spotify states that if you like your daylist at any particular time, you can save it by scrolling down to <strong>add to playlist > new playlist</strong>.</p><p>Other playlists, such as personalized playlists, curated editorial selections, and even the ones you make yourself, are available for free-tier users. Creating your own and adding a few songs to get you going is said to help Spotify recommend you more. Additionally, updated Android and iOS devices should soon find the option to create their own playlist cover.</p><p>Hit the three-dot menu and tap "create cover art" to find a variety of images, text effects, and graphics.</p><h2 id="more-musical-control-and-more-singing-2">More musical control, and more singing!</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="NhdkfjoBRn6aqcmPYybDpH" name="spotify-search-and-play-free-tier-snapshot" alt="Spotify's search and play experience lets users find songs they love and play them instantly, as well as the option of adding it quickly to a playlist or "Liked."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NhdkfjoBRn6aqcmPYybDpH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="jYnJUsMQr2TTCjRAYDJGpH" name="spotify-lyrics-sharing-screenshot" alt="Users on Spotify can view lyrics when listening to supported songs and share those lyrics with people on social media and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYnJUsMQr2TTCjRAYDJGpH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Spotify's free tier is upgrading users' ability to play and search for songs on its platform, as well as sharing what they've found.

The company teases that the Xiaomi 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are equipped with its new "magic back screen" (machine-translated). The teaser opens with the phone on the horizon, showing off its rounded corners and flat sides.</p><p>After flipping over, we're presented with its large external display on its back panel, which houses two camera lenses, though one is rumored to sit under that, too.</p><p>Xiaomi's video illuminates the "magic back screen," giving us a few examples of future uses. It seems the Chinese OEM intends for the display to be used as a clock, perhaps for music, photography, and more. The end of the clip flashes the "Xiaomi 17 Pro" name, further confirming that the Pro and Pro Max will feature this external display, not just a camera array on its back.</p><p>Xiaomi states, officially, that it intends to launch the 17 series "this month" in September.</p><h2 id="from-leaks-to-confirmation-2">From leaks to confirmation</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING！Let’s take a look at the new design of the Xiaomi 17 series, the most anticipated flagship phone at the end of the year. pic.twitter.com/sgXeAhzq9h<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1967791790662226142">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We just wrapped up a round of Xiaomi 17 series leaks yesterday (Sep 15), as a tipster on Weibo spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/leaked-xiaomi-17-pro-render-huge-external-screen">the company's profile icon change</a>. Xiaomi changed its profile to a model from the upcoming 17 series, proudly showing off its external display. The screen back there resembles what you'd find on a foldable device, especially as it fully encompasses its cameras, like a clamshell phone.</p><p>A statement by Xiaomi's head, Lu Weibing, was also highlighted yesterday, as a post by them on Weibo confirmed the new series will rock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. Moreover, we're expecting three devices: a Xiaomi 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. What's funny is that this external screen idea on a slab phone is something Xiaomi tried years ago with the Mi 11 Ultra.</p><p>That device sported an external screen, though it was quite tiny and vertical on the right side of its horizontal camera housing. Now, in 2025, it seems Xiaomi is leveraging some of that foldable tech for a display that's much larger and more immersive, capable of displaying elements from across its mobile OS. Following Xiaomi's assumed September launch confirmation, we have roughly two weeks before the 17 series launches, ideally.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's exactly what I'm suggesting you do if you're in the market for a new tablet, because Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 FE offers much of the same experience, but is currently on sale <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1"><strong>for just $429</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Tab S10 FE</a> normally retails for about $500, so this deal saves you $80, and it's available from Amazon, Best Buy, and even Samsung directly. Speaking of Samsung, if you already have a tablet and want to upgrade, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-blue-128gb-sku-sm-x520nlbaxar/">save up to $350 with trade-in</a>, knocking the price of the Tab S10 FE down to just $149.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ and the ancient Tab S7+ are both worth the most, maxing out the trade-in deal. But as long as you have a tablet that isn't broken and still holds a charge, you can trade it in and save $100. However, the trade-in doesn't stack with the current deal, so it's either one or the other.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Pvxmz8VoTfJXR6P6v7UE7M" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pvxmz8VoTfJXR6P6v7UE7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZSRJ8Q?th=1" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: $499" data-dimension25=""><del>$499</del> <strong>$429 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Just because it's not as new as the Tab S11, that doesn't mean you should just ignore the Galaxy Tab S10 FE. Not only is a fantastic tablet, at a fraction of the price, but that price is now even lower from pretty much all of your favorite retailers. </p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-10-9-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-gray/J3ZYGXC9QH/sku/6618942">Best Buy - $429</a> | <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-blue-128gb-sku-sm-x520nlbaxar/">Samsung - $429</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're in the market for a new tablet, know that you want a Samsung Galaxy Tab, but don't want to pay for the new Galaxy Tab S11.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the most powerful and premium tablet that Samsung offers, short of the Tab S11 Ultra. Or you're still holding onto your Galaxy Tab S9 and are ready to upgrade to the latest 11-inch model.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab FE lineup is far from being overly flashy, which also means that it doesn't come packed to the brim with features you won't use. Well, at least in the Gemini and Galaxy AI department, as some of those features require a bit more horsepower in order to provide a smooth experience.</p><p>That said, the Tab S10 FE is an excellent alternative to the Galaxy Tab S11, and not just because they're practically the same size. For one, there are still plenty of fun and useful features available on the Tab S10 FE, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and Handwriting Assist in the Samsung Notes app.</p><p>The latter of which pairs quite well with the Tab S10 FE, especially when you consider that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-samsung-galaxy-tab-models-support-s-pen">includes an S Pen</a> in the box. It's not the fancy new hexagonal S Pen that just debuted with the Tab S11 series, but that's more of a design change than anything else.</p><p>Some other features of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE that might be noteworthy are the 90Hz display, IP68 water and dust rating, and the built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slot</a>. Plus, the Tab S10 FE is rated for up to 20 hours of battery life, which is even longer than what the brand new Galaxy Tab S11 is rated for.</p><p>No matter what way you look at it, as long as you don't have a specific requirement for having the "best of the best," the Tab S10 FE is easily the "best of the rest." Then, you can treat yourself (or loved ones) to a nice dinner with all of the money you saved.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The iPhone 17 Pro is the entry point to the Pro series, and it has the exact same features as the Pro Max model — just in a more compact size and with a smaller battery. On the Android side, the Pixel 10 Pro is its closest and direct competitor that happens to be priced roughly the same.</p><p>While it might seem like a slam dunk for the iPhone, the Pixel 10 Pro has its share of trump cards too; it should be able to pull off clearer telephoto images, the AI features are most definitely more alluring, and the larger battery capacity should allow it to last longer on a single charge. Plus, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> design language in Android 16 is prettier than ever.

The most noticeable change is a wider camera bump on the back that Apple calls the "camera plateau." This raised portion creates more room inside for components, allowing for a larger battery. The result is a phone that's actually thicker and heavier than its predecessor. It's thicker than the Pixel 10 Pro as well, but lighter by one gram.</p><p>Apple has ditched titanium for the frame and gone back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 Pro. It's a unibody design for the first time, which Apple claims provides significantly better durability. The phone is IP68 rated, supports MagSafe charging, and you now get Ceramic Shield over the back panel as well. Another iPhone first is the use of a vapor chamber for more effective cooling.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> also uses a vapor chamber, just like most other Android flagships for the past decade. There's nothing worth writing about in terms of design, though, as it's nearly identical to the Pixel 9 Pro from 2024. The 10 Pro does get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which lets it use Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging and accessories natively, just like the iPhone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M8qXLesHgH95i7QM5SMuED" name="Pixel-10-Pro-all-hues" alt="Pixel 10 Pro in all shades" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8qXLesHgH95i7QM5SMuED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>iPhones have always had impressive displays, and the iPhone 17 Pro is no exception. It's a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits. Apple is using its new Ceramic Shield 2 coating over the display, which it says offers three times better scratch resistance than before. Thankfully, there's a lot less glass on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro due to the new design, which means the odds of cracking it when dropped are less.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro has the exact same screen size as the iPhone 17 Pro, with roughly the same resolution, too. This LTPO OLED panel also has a 120Hz refresh rate, but the peak brightness is higher at 3,300 nits. It's not the most eye-friendly display, though, due to its low PWM dimming rate, although Google has added an option to fix this in software.

While it's great for AI tasks, it's still not the best for other things like AAA gaming.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>iPhone 17 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3‑inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, 2622 x 1206-pixel resolution at 460 ppi, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Super Actua OLED, 2856 x 1280-pixel resolution, 495 ppi, 1-120Hz, 3,300 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>128, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP, f/1.9 wide</p></td><td  ><p>42MP, f/2.2 Dual PD AF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>48MP Fusion Main: 24 mm, ƒ/1.6 aperture, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Main, f/1.7 aperture, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48MP Fusion Ultrawide: 13 mm, ƒ/2.2 aperture and 120° field of view</p></td><td  ><p>48MP 123-degree ultrawide with macro focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48MP, 4x optical zoom, 8x optical-quality zoom, OIS</p></td><td  ><p>48MP, 5x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Adaptive True Tone flash, Photonic Engine, Deep Fusion, Smart HDR 5, Next-generation portraits with Focus and Depth Control, Portrait Lighting with six effects, Night mode, Panorama (up to 63MP), Latest-generation Photographic Styles, Spatial photos, 48MP macro photography, ProRAW, Wide color capture for photos and Live Photos, Lens correction (Fusion Ultra Wide), Advanced red-eye correction, Auto image stabilization, Burst mode</p></td><td  ><p>4K/60 10-bit HDR on all cameras, 8K/30 on rear cameras, Pro controls, High-Res (up to 50 MP), Pro Res Zoom up to 100x, Camera Coach, Add Me, Macro Focus, Night Sight, Astrophotography, High-Res Portrait, Mode (50 MP), Face Unblur, Auto Unblur, Long Exposure, Action Pan, Real Tone, Panorama, Auto Best Take, Frequent Faces, Top Shot</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,988mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,780mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W wired, 25W MagSafe or Qi2.2 wireless</p></td><td  ><p>30W wired, Qi2.2 Pixelsnap wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, mmWave, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, UWB, Thread, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, NFC, Dual-band GPS, 5G mmWave (NA only), 5G Sub-6, LTE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Ceramic Shield 2 (front glass), Ceramic Shield (rear class), Aluminum</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front-and back, IP68, Aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>150 x 71.9 x 8.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>206 grams</p></td><td  ><p>207 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The iPhone 17 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro offer the latest wireless technology.

The iPhone 17 Pro gets a new 48MP telephoto camera with 4x optical zoom, while the main camera now has a wider f/1.6 aperture for better low-light photos. There's a new square 18MP front camera sensor, which allows you to take a selfie in multiple orientations without having to hold the phone horizontally. For filmmakers, the addition of ProRes RAW video capture is a big deal, as you can now use the 17 Pro for professional-grade video workflows.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro features the same resolution sensors as before, but Pro Res Zoom can now zoom up to 100x. New features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a> and Auto Best Take are sure to be appreciated by everyone.

A lot of the AI processing for the new features on the Pixel 10 Pro now runs on-device, which means faster operation and better privacy. Android 16 isn't as big a visual overhaul as iOS 26 is, but the changes are meaningful and make using your Pixel even better.</p><p>AI performance is in the Pixel 10's favor, due to Google's more mature suite of features led by Gemini. Meanwhile, Apple is still catching up with its AI, and while it has some notable features, they generally don't compare to those found on the Pixel, and we're still waiting for the major Siri overhaul.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">iPhone 17 Pro vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm" name="iPhone-17-Pro-2" alt="The iPhone 17 Pro Max in press renders showing the unibody design and camera features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is never an easy answer, as you'll be choosing between two very different platforms, and many factors, such as your current accessories, wearables, and chargers, will need to be considered. I think the iPhone 17 Pro is a fantastic choice over the Pixel 10 Pro, even if you are a long-time Android user. Sure, Apple is trailing behind in the AI game, but apart from that, nearly everything else seems better. The more powerful chip, better video recording capabilities, eye-friendly display, faster charging, and compatibility with a ton more cases and accessories.</p><p>I'd choose the Pixel 10 Pro if AI features are the biggest draw for you. It comes close to the iPhone in overall specs, except in a few areas like gaming. Like the iPhone, it too will get day-one OS upgrades, and its current features will keep getting augmented thanks to Pixel Drop updates.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f551b691-c82b-4c7d-b300-6baa3f43600a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The need for speed</strong></em></p><p>If you want raw power and excellent industrial design, the iPhone 17 Pro is the clear winner.

The phone was so <em>stupid</em> thin I was sure it wouldn't last a day on a single charge, much less be able to sustain top-end performance while playing games. To my astonishment, it passed both of those tests with flying colors, and this year's Magic V5 is <em>even thinner</em>.</p><p>If you can believe it, despite being even thinner than the previous year's phone, the Magic V5's battery is 13% larger. It seemingly makes no sense, especially given that the battery is 32% larger than the similarly thin Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. While it might sound like voodoo magic, the secret comes from a place you might not have expected: electric cars.</p><p>Honor has been using these silicon-carbon batteries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">for a few years now</a>, and each year they improve. This year, we got an even bigger bump than usual, and it's enabling phones to get thinner without compromising on important things like battery life and charging speed.</p><h2 id="from-cars-to-smartphones-2">From cars to smartphones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jqVfHDAsnVtYcnUZuzxPY9" name="honor-magic-v5-gold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-blue-bottom-tent-02" alt="Comparing the gold Honor Magic V5's hardware with the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqVfHDAsnVtYcnUZuzxPY9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Group14 Technologies is the company behind the big push for more silicon in our batteries, and a lot of this push began with the need for more energy in electric cars. Cars, after all, require <em>a lot</em> more power to function than your average smartphone, so it was important to figure out how to get a larger capacity battery that <strong>also</strong> charges quickly into the same size form factor.</p><p>This is done by taking the traditional lithium battery material, graphite, and blending it with silicon in the anode part of the battery. Electric car anodes can have up to 30% silicon blended with graphite, while the Honor Magic V5 tops out at 15%, which is still the most we've seen in any smartphone to date.</p><p>Since silicon stores a lot more energy in the same space as graphite, manufacturers can create higher-capacity batteries that fit in the same space. In an ultra-thin phone like the Honor Magic V5, Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, or even the iPhone Air, a larger silicon-carbon battery can make your thin phone feel like magic.

The gist is that shipping regulations cap a battery at 20Wh in capacity, which equates to roughly 5400mAh in the smartphone world. This restriction is partly why Chinese models typically have larger batteries than the global model of the same phone.</p><p>The Honor Magic V5 packs a 5,820mAh battery, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 uses just a 4,400mAh battery. While this might sound like a problem for Honor initially, the trick is that this regulation is <em>per cell</em>, meaning companies have to use dual-cell batteries. The good news is that companies like OnePlus and Honor have been doing this for years.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Battery size</p></th><th  ><p>Weight</p></th><th  ><p>Time to 100%</p></th><th  ><p>Average amount per minute</p></th><th  ><p>Peak temperature</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></td><td  ><p>4400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>51.76mAh</p></td><td  ><p>33C ⭐</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V5</p></td><td  ><p>5820mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>217g</p></td><td  ><p>50 minutes ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>116.4mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>36C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>5000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>218g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour</p></td><td  ><p>83.33mAh</p></td><td  ><p>33C ⭐</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>5200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td><td  ><p>1 hour 35 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>54.75mAh</p></td><td  ><p>40C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>6000mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>210g ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>35 mins ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>171.42mAh ⭐</p></td><td  ><p>32C ⭐</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Using a dual-cell battery also ensures faster charging rates since you can charge two cells in tandem.

Amazon will have to compete directly with Meta for its AR glasses to succeed, but it'll have to do better than its Echo Frames if it wants to compete.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-ar-glasses-challenge-meta">The Information</a>, Amazon has two prototypes in production. "Jayhawk" will have "microphones, speakers, a camera, and a full-color display in one eye." For Amazon delivery drivers, "Amelia" will reportedly use dual screens to "help drivers sort and deliver packages."</p><p>Amazon's consumer AR glasses will allegedly arrive in "late 2026 or early 2027," with a current target "price point of about $800."</p><p>Amazon's hardware brand is all about value.

Anything less than $800 would produce a subpar design no one would wear; I'm happy Amazon knows not to try.</p><p>To inspire thrifty customers to spend smartphone-level money, Amazon must change people's perception of Amazon Glasses as being desirable, in a way it failed to do with Echo Frames.</p><h2 id="step-1-give-alexa-plus-a-makeover-or-publicity-push-2">Step 1: Give Alexa Plus a makeover or publicity push</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH" name="Alexa-plus-logo" alt="Amazon Alexa Plus logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QjE7GDAz7Ue44EoUbNrrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">Alexa Plus</a> earlier this year with a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered intelligence and language boost, with AI "experts" on specialized topics similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>'s Gems.

By sitting parallel to the phone’s body, they deliver 3x to 10x optical zoom, a big leap from older digital zoom approaches.</p><p>Even with recent progress, smartphone zoom still has a big drawback. Current phone zoom is stuck at fixed steps, like 2x or 10x, forcing digital zoom to fill the gaps and degrading quality.</p><p>Samsung’s continuous zoom system fixes this by physically moving the lenses to deliver smooth optical-quality zoom across a full range, just like a standalone camera.</p><p>The upcoming continuous zoom camera from the Korean tech giant is set to phase out older telephoto and periscope sensors in future phones, keeping images sharp even at higher zoom levels on upcoming flagship models.</p><p>Technically, continuous zoom works by dividing a telephoto module’s lenses into several groups and shifting them precisely to adjust focal length, creating smooth, uninterrupted magnification.</p><p>Hopefully, Samsung brings this tech to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">own flagships</a> soon, as it’d be a huge leap forward for smartphone photography.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature, fine-tuned over a two-year test phase, is built to help them tap into a bigger global audience. The full rollout should wrap up in the next few weeks.</p><p>The feature relies on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> in order to recreate the creator’s voice and emotions for translations that feel genuine.</p><h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2><p>Creators have two dubbing options: manual or automatic. With manual dubbing, they can upload their own voiceovers or bring in professional talent. Automatic dubbing, on the other hand, uses machine translation and synthetic voices to create new audio tracks. It’s turned on by default for eligible channels, but creators can opt out or review the AI-generated dubs before they go live.</p><p>At the moment, automatic dubbing translates English videos into Japanese, Hindi, Spanish, and Korean, with more languages on the way. But YouTube warns the AI may miss subtle tones, idioms, or proper names. Creators who need precise, expressive translations might still prefer manual voiceovers or pro dubbing services.</p><h2 id="how-to-manage-it-2">How to manage it</h2><p>To handle your multi-language dubs, you’ll need YouTube Studio on desktop. In Settings > Upload defaults > Advanced settings, you can toggle <em>Allow automatic dubbing</em> for all future uploads.</p><p>If you’d rather approve dubs first, turn on <em>Manually review dubs before publishing </em>— you can review every track or just the experimental languages.</p><p>For individual videos, head to the <strong>Content </strong>tab, then <strong>Languages</strong>, where you can preview, publish, unpublish, or delete audio tracks. Viewers can switch between the original and dubbed audio anytime from the video’s settings menu.</p><p>Back in 2023, YouTube first tested the feature with a small group of creators, including big names like MrBeast, Mark Rober, and chef Jamie Oliver.</p><p>YouTube says the pilot was a big win. In fact, creators using multi-language audio saw over 25% of their watch time come from viewers in other languages. Chef Jamie Oliver’s channel is a standout case, with viewership tripling after adding dubbed tracks.</p><p>For viewers, this opens up way more content since you can skip the subtitles and just listen to the translated audio.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We've already heard about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/leaked-xiaomi-17-pro-render-huge-external-screen">upcoming Xiaomi 17 series</a> and Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones, and now leaks of the OnePlus 15 are surfacing as a leaker has shared an image showcasing the phone’s rear design.</p><p>The leak comes from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5210689526566567">Weibo user</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/first_photo_of_the_oneplus_15_reveals_its_revamped_design_and_the_three_colorways-news-69498.php">GSMArena</a>) who claims to have revealed the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, showing the new camera module design and the three colors it will reportedly launch in. Gone is the circular camera module design that was a OnePlus staple, replaced with what looks like an iPhone-inspired square module.</p><p>The image shows a square camera module at the top left of the device, with two lenses arranged vertically and a third lens to their right — very similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The module also includes a flash, but no Hasselblad branding, as OnePlus has ended that partnership in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">favor of its own DetailMax Engine</a>.</p><h2 id="the-next-oneplus-flagship-may-look-a-little-familiar-2">The next OnePlus flagship may look a little familiar</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.82%;"><img id="Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8" name="oneplus-15-camera-module-look" alt="First look at the OnePlus 15's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2655" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone also appears in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15s-color-lineup-may-omit-a-long-standing-favorite-as-it-gains-a-165hz-refresh-rate">three colors</a>: Absolute Black, Mist Purple, and Sand Dune.

The display bezel is also said to be "symmetrical front."</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is also expected to pack Qualcomm's latest flagship chipset paired with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-could-show-up-with-a-massive-battery-and-a-drastic-redesign">massive 7,000 mAh battery</a>. Similar to the OnePlus 13, it's rumored to support 100W fast wireless charging. This time, the company is also expected to put a stronger focus on AI features.</p><p>OnePlus hasn't announced official launch plans for the OnePlus 15, but rumors suggest it could debut in October 2025 in China, followed by a global launch in early 2026.

Even partnerships with OpenAI and ChatGPT weren't enough to help the iPhone compete with mobile AI suites like Google AI or Galaxy AI.</p><p>Apple seemed to learn from its mistakes at the iPhone 16 event; instead of announcing lofty feature goals alongside the iPhone 17 that it couldn't deliver on, it chose not to discuss artificial intelligence at all. The absence of Apple Intelligence talk <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">at the company's recent keynote</a> wasn't really a shock, considering key features announced a year prior still aren't ready yet. It begs the following questions: does Apple even need AI to sell iPhones, and do iPhone users even want it?</p><p>The answer to the first question is still up in the air, but we now decisively know that Apple's users do care about AI. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-gemini-app-feature-you-actually-wanted-is-here">Google's Gemini app for iOS</a> recently overtook ChatGPT to become the top free app on the App Store. It's a major win for Google, as it signals that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">momentum is shifting from ChatGPT to Gemini</a>. Additionally, it's a sign that even as Apple's internal AI efforts may be stalling, iPhone users are getting their mobile AI fix somewhere else.</p><h2 id="why-apple-barely-talked-about-ai-in-its-iphone-17-event-2">Why Apple barely talked about AI in its iPhone 17 event</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe" name="iphone-17-pro-promo-render-from-announcement" alt="Render of the iPhone 17 Pro in all three colors from announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k24br4t5Pe6THQc8LrsKDe.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2291" height="1289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's fall keynote was light on AI features, with the biggest one discussed being Live Translation on the AirPods Pro 3 and older models. Apple focused on practical implementations of AI, like Live Translation, which bridges communication barriers by translating conversations to your preferred language in real time. The same strategy can be seen with Workout Buddy, an AI feature for Apple Watch that helps coach you with fitness insights during your session.</p><p>The positioning of new features as practical solutions to real-world problems is a stark contrast to how Apple has talked about AI in the past. At past WWDC keynotes and launch events, the company touted Apple Intelligence features in traditional generative AI implementations, like text editing, image creation, and voice assistance.</p><p>The problem with the latter approach is that Apple's foundation models aren't on-par with those from Google or OpenAI, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence can rarely compete</a> with Gemini or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> in traditional gen-AI tasks. Instead, where the company can make its mark in the AI space is with specific features that leverage Apple hardware for a unique task, much like Live Translation or Workout Buddy.</p><p>While the company is still working on improving Apple Intelligence's capabilities, it's choosing to talk about those gen-AI features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-apple-intelligence-features-are-available-today/" target="_blank">press releases</a> rather than lengthy keynote segments. After all, it seems pretty clear that competitors provide a better experience in text and image generation as well as voice assistance than Apple Intelligence and Siri. Now, that's reflected by iPhone users in the App Store's top charts.</p><h2 id="why-gemini-is-a-better-stopgap-for-ios-users-than-chatgpt-2">Why Gemini is a better stopgap for iOS users than ChatGPT</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6B2GausoFaHwvVDEyc4H28" name="google-gemini-response-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini response on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6B2GausoFaHwvVDEyc4H28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini is now the top free app on the App Store, and this is an impressive feat that shows just how far Google AI has come. Across 483,000 ratings, the Gemini app for iOS has 4.8 out of five stars, which is standout performance. It's also the number one app in the productivity category, ahead of ChatGPT and Google's own Gmail app.</p><p>Out of the thousands of reviews for the Gemini app on the App Store, there's one that really exemplifies why Apple users are flocking toward Google for their AI needs. "I wasn't sure if this app would work as advertised but it absolutely does," writes user Jrich828. "Siri does not work as well for me but Gemini has managed to answer all my quirky questions. Love it!"</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's the jist of why iPhone users are starting to use Gemini in droves. It's not just that Google's AI is useful — that wouldn't be enough for people inside the Apple ecosystem to give Gemini a try. Further, it's that Apple Intelligence and Siri are failing to fulfill a need, so iOS users are looking for something better.</p><p>While it's just one app review, the above sentiment is extremely common in Apple circles. Siri has been behind the curve dating back to the Google Assistant days, and Gemini can simply run circles around Apple's AI offerings. On top of that, Gemini is really easy to use on iPhone. You can add Gemini widgets to your home and lock screens for easy access, and even open the app with a voice command if you're savvy with Shortcuts.</p><p>Even as Apple partners with ChatGPT for Apple Intelligence, users are going out of their way to try Gemini. Aside from the above factors, I suspect iOS users are eager to use Google AI because<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps"> they're familiar with other Google apps and services</a>, like Gmail, Search, or YouTube. The Google ecosystem may not feel as familiar as Apple's, but it's not foreign either.</p><p>Gemini becoming the top free app on the App Store is an indication that iPhone users have spoken. Gemini and ChatGPT are numbers one and two on the platform. Users want AI on their phones, but they'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">rather have better third-party options than Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7717a8a0-0fec-474b-9919-97aaacb39853">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Gemini at the core</strong></em></p><p>While the Gemini app works great on iPhone, it's deeply integrated with Android 16 on the Google Pixel 10 Pro.

Interestingly, it seems Meta has chosen a name that goes against what was previously rumored. The leaked clip teases a pair of "Meta Ray-Ban Display" smart glasses. While nothing's confirmed yet, Android Central's Michael Hicks wondered about this possibility, stating, "putting Ray-Ban in front makes them more likely to appeal to people than Meta."</p><p>Ray-Ban <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-q2-earnings-continue-to-soar-as-ai-fuels-its-ad-revenue">sales have been soaring</a>, so perhaps opting to include the name <em>could </em>grip more consumers in the long run.</p><p>One of the key highlights about these glasses, which we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-hypernova">rumored several times</a>, is a single ocular screen. The publication states that in a now-removed unlisted video from Meta, the clip shows the display over a single eye and its practices, such as texting and map navigation.</p><p>Regarding the former, the model in the short clip is wearing what appears to be the expected sEMG bracelet, which will let users interact with the HUD without physical input. The user is simply swiping their finger on a surface and inscribing their text within the ocular HUD while star-gazing.</p><p>The map navigation seems pretty standard to what you'd find on a phone or your smartwatch. It's just in your vision now. Of course, Meta AI is woven throughout these glasses. The clip showcased live translation capabilities and the ability for the AI to identify vegetables, such as bright red tomatoes.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:721px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.89%;"><img id="X7jveY6kVBLDBtyMwMw7ac" name="meta-ray-ban-display-leaked-design" alt="A leaked image of the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses all-black design with the Meta logo and a front camera on its right-side frame." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7jveY6kVBLDBtyMwMw7ac.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="721" height="403" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="RMQiYfHojfHEAx59UiSwZc" name="meta-ray-ban-display-leaked-design-hud" alt="A leaked look at the alleged Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses HUD for a single lens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMQiYfHojfHEAx59UiSwZc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="728" height="407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:726px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.65%;"><img id="8CaEJLgGF2VpSgFj7bz2ac" name="meta-ray-ban-display-leaked-design-semg-bracelet" alt="A leaked snapshot of the sEMG bracelet, expected to be paired with the upcoming (alleged) Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses with a single ocular HUD." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8CaEJLgGF2VpSgFj7bz2ac.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="726" height="404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UploadVR)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The design of the smart glasses is also briefly seen throughout the short clip.

These glasses are essentially a duo, as users will need the "gesture bracelet," otherwise known as the sEMG bracelet, to fulfill their action. This bracelet is seen on the model "writing" out their text while looking skyward.</p><p>This sEMG bracelet is something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Android Central has tested before</a>. A device primed to take hand tracking to new heights. The band utilizes a person's electrical impulses from their hand and wrist muscles to understand what they're doing/trying to accomplish.</p><p>As a side note, there's also a new pair of Oakley smart glasses in this removed unlisted video. The glasses resemble a visor, with a complete golden sheen to them. Funnily enough, they look similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich's mockup</a> from a few months ago. What these new glasses could be called isn't known just yet, but there's a chance we'll find out soon.</p><p>This leaked video has appeared right when we're waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect 2025</a> event to kick off this week (Wednesday, Sep 17). We're expecting to see more about these Hypernova (Meta Ray-Ban Display) glasses, as well as the 3rd-gen Ray-Ban glasses, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has already acknowledged battery issues with the Pixel 6a, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/this-must-install-update-for-the-pixel-6a-aims-to-tackle-overheating-issues">some units catching fire</a>, and the Pixel 7a, where a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-7a-extended-repair-program-information-explained">repair program was launched</a> due to swelling issues. Now, users of the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are also reporting battery swelling problems.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/09/15/pixel-7-and-7-pro-battery-swelling/">Piunikaweb</a>, reports of Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro users facing swollen batteries have increased significantly over the past few months. Users have taken to Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/310619649/pixel-7pro-bottom-end-of-screen-bowing-battery-swelling-why?hl=en">support forum</a>, as well as platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-7-pixel-7-pro-battery-swelling-3597642/">X/Twitter</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1h5gpdp/pixel_7_battery_swollen/">Reddit</a>, to share their issues.</p><p>The problem is not entirely new, either. Back in May 2025, a Pixel 7 Pro owner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/342237331/pixel-7-pro-battery-swelling-and-device-separation?hl=en">posted</a> on Google's forums that the side panel of their device had "started to separate" because of a swollen battery. That post attracted significant attention, with numerous other users chiming in to confirm they were seeing similar issues with their Pixel 7 Pro units as well.</p><h2 id="more-google-pixel-phones-are-swelling-2">More Google Pixel phones are swelling</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.34%;"><img id="x2xHWvSaQ5Jy4aq2SG68hX" name="pixel-7-battery-swollen-2" alt="Image showcasing a swollen Pixel 7 Pro from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2xHWvSaQ5Jy4aq2SG68hX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2650" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: X/Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.47%;"><img id="5SAafMXz88MEPcCv3CGj3a" name="pixel-7-battery-swollen-1" alt="Image showcasing a swollen Pixel 7 Pro from various angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5SAafMXz88MEPcCv3CGj3a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="9040" height="4020" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Support Forum)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>So far, the majority of reports seem related to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-tested-over-a-hundred-phones-in-2022-heres-why-you-should-buy-the-pixel-7-pro">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, though some Pixel 7 users have also experienced the issue.</p><p>Google's response so far appears inconsistent.

On the other hand, several customers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/369941547?hl=en&msgid=372397468">report</a> struggling to get any meaningful reply from Google’s support team.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the first time Pixel phones have been caught up in such controversies. Google already runs a free battery replacement program for Pixel 7a devices, but now it appears the problem has extended to other Pixel 7 series models.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>I've been using Govee's lighting products for the better part of a half-decade now, and it's safe to say that the brand is my favorite lighting manufacturer. It consistently rolls out interesting products, and tight integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Home Assistant make it easier than ever to control its products.</p><p>Govee is having a busy 2025, with the brand introducing a slew of products across new categories. Its latest is the Uplighter Floor Lamp, which delivers vibrant diffused lighting and doubles as a reading lamp. The Uplighter Floor Lamp made its debut in July 2025, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Uplighter-Projector-Bedroom-Standing/dp/B0F3NZ12GL">available on Amazon for $159</a>. You can get it for slightly lesser ($152) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-uplighter-floor-lamp?variant=44954993131705">if you buy from Govee's website</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9GBqsusNUGUAYZQmqWAXTG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GBqsusNUGUAYZQmqWAXTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the outset, the Uplighter Floor Lamp looks like any regular lamp. Setting it up takes just over 10 minutes, and it's about as straightforward as it gets. Where it stands out is the three distinct lighting zones; it serves as a diffuse light that projects onto a wall, you can use it as an ambient light, and there's an LED at the bottom that makes it a reading light.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FvyNTS8UZSXKUx546k9k7G" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvyNTS8UZSXKUx546k9k7G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The overall design is minimalist, and it doesn't stand out much — when it's off. Govee sells the lamp in black, and I would've liked to see it in white. Outside of that, I don't have any issues with the design or build quality. The stand itself is made out of aluminum, and it has a power button and effect switcher that cycles between various lighting modes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KMt3YYkKrrp5X4Qwq9gVDF" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMt3YYkKrrp5X4Qwq9gVDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The diffuse mode is where the Uplighter Floor Lamp shines, with the lamp delivering dynamic effects. As is the case with all Govee lights, you get plenty of customizability via the mobile app; there's a good selection of scenes available, and you can easily create your own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TkJuKhEj7Xe2F6pT2r4yRG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkJuKhEj7Xe2F6pT2r4yRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The diffuse light in conjunction with the ambient light turns the Uplighter Floor Lamp into a party lamp, and it's just plain cool. The LEDs do a good job with the diffusion effect, and it's bright enough to use even during the day even though it's best used at night.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x5LPKMCKHJmMeBCiCbj8NG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5LPKMCKHJmMeBCiCbj8NG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also used the focused light quite a bit while reading on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Colour</a>; it doesn't have RGB lighting, but can switch from 2700K to 6500K color modes, and you can adjust the brightness of the light and set up schedules to trigger it automatically. The focus light goes up to 1000 lumen, and there are absolutely no issues in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="R2uEPLMU4rAsZwAGgbLJ4G" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R2uEPLMU4rAsZwAGgbLJ4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can do the same with the diffused light as well, or enable music mode wherein the effects change according to music that's being played. The versatility is where the Uplighter Floor Lamp wins out against other floor lamps, and the dome swivels 330 degrees, allowing you to easily change the orientation of the light.</p><p>Like Govee's recent products, you get Matter integration as well, and it's easy to configure the lamp with the smart home interface of your choice. I use Home Assistant alongside Google Assistant, and it was a breeze to control lighting effects and toggle the device's power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8786JdNzF8MwNGcryc42NG" name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8786JdNzF8MwNGcryc42NG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With Govee's DreamView tech, you can easily sync lighting effects across the brand's products, and it has come a long way in the last year. The feature is easy to use, and all you need to do is add the products into a zone.</p><p>The number of scenes available along with the trio of lighting zones make the Uplighter Floor Lamp a good choice if you want a focused light that also does RGB diffused lighting.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a467670b-f00f-46d7-8651-fcf12002035d">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Uplighter-Projector-Bedroom-Standing/dp/B0F3NZ12GL" data-model-name="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.38%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JaskTB4fW53Qky4SXrVq.jpg' alt="Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Govee Uplighter Floor Lamp</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Uplighter Floor Lamp is a diffuse light that doubles as a focused reading light, and the sheer number of features available make it a good choice. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, can dish out tailored advice and comparisons. Wish List alerts, personalized deal recommendations, and even Amazon Lens (a visual search feature that identifies products from photos) can save you some scrolling.</p><p>Amazon’s research suggests users in the UK love the hunt: 61% say snagging a bargain gives them a rush, and more than half feel proud enough to brag about their savings.</p><h2 id="delivery-made-easy-2">Delivery made easy</h2><p>Prime’s free delivery makes the whole thing even easier. During the sale, you can choose from options like One-Day Delivery, Same-Day Delivery (in select areas), or pick up your orders at an Amazon Locker or Counter at no extra cost.</p><p>The UK joins a global lineup of participating countries, including the U.S., Germany, Japan, and — new this year — Ireland, Mexico, and Colombia.</p><p>Whether you’re planning ahead for Christmas or just eyeing a kitchen upgrade, Prime Big Deal Days is likely to have something worth adding to your cart.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Why? Is it not as safe as they tell us? I'm curious as to why people think this.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hi Charles and thanks for asking a great question that also calls me out for things I've mentioned and not properly explained. That's important to do and it helps me remember that I'm not just talking to a room full of techie nerds.</p><p>I can't speak for everyone, but some others and I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-miss-my-fingerprint-sensor-not-reason-you-might-think" target="_blank">fingerprints aren't the best way </a>to provide credentials because they're not a password—they're your identity. It's also one of those things you can never change if you need to.</p><p>Regarding security, yes, if you try really hard, you can "crack" a biometric sensor like a fingerprint reader. It's extremely complex and riddled with failures before it would ever work, but if something seems important enough, someone will keep trying until they are successful. Think latex, 3D dental printers, and more spy movie style sheniangans.</p><p>Like most things surrounding security, this makes it more than acceptable. For most of us, nobody is ever going to try that hard to get into our stuff, even if they have a perfect copy of our fingerprints. And when they start trying, they have to find a way around Android or iOS blocking them after a bunch of failed attempts. I'm saying <strong>use your fingerprint without any worries</strong> that it gets hacked unless you're the president of a country or a multi-billionaire.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FjtmFuFKY5NmGTvDNz6ibQ" name="google-account-lock.jpg" alt="A lock in front of an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjtmFuFKY5NmGTvDNz6ibQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly mentioned that it's not security that makes me think a fingerprint is not the right solution, so let me explain. Note that this doesn't make me right or wrong; it's just a popular idea among people who nerd out trying to break things.</p><p>Your fingerprint is your username. You are Charles, and your fingerprints will always say that you are Charles, like mine always will say I'm Jerry. Using one as a type of passcode, while secure, has a few issues.</p><p>The biggest is that you can never change them. Let's say in 2026 someone finds a way to crack the encryption that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11s-new-biometric-security-means-all-your-apps-can-work-pixel-4s-face-unlock">keeps biometrics safe</a>. If you have all of your devices and accounts protected by a fingerprint, there is nothing you can do to change it other than stop using your fingerprints and never use them again.</p><p>You will always be Charles, and you will always have Charles' fingerprints. If Joe gets a digital copy of them, they are worthless for protecting anything from Joe. Once Joe can do it, everyone can do it.</p><p>I doubt someone will be able to crack into enough encryption to make fingerprint data something they can use, but anything is possible, and we both know people are trying to do it. People are trying to do everything, it seems.</p><h2 id="a-better-way-2">A better way?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o2in9iK6eDrPYA6kUdTRtN" name="Google-passkey.jpg" alt="Google Passkey on a Windows 11 PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2in9iK6eDrPYA6kUdTRtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google and Apple are both working on new ways to secure your devices and accounts. In conjunction with folks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fidoalliance.org/" target="_blank">FIDO Alliance,</a> traditional passwords are becoming things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-problem-with-passkeys">passkeys</a>, and eventually, you might not ever use your fingerprint again.</p><p>I don't like any of the current solutions for one reason: corporate ecosystem lock-in. I do not want to have to rely on Google, Apple, or Microsoft to make the right decisions surrounding my accounts and how I log into them every time. If I commit to Google's emerging passkey system, what if I decide I no longer want to use Google for any of my hardware or software needs? Will I be able to keep my accounts and be able to log into them with Google behind it? Maybe. Maybe it isn't good enough.</p><p>I don't know a better way. Managing secure login procedures is not something people can do themselves, even though they think they are able to. I currently use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Security-Key-NFC-Yubico-authentication/dp/B0BVNRXFHT?tag=georiot-us-default-20&ascsubtag=ac-us-5113532818275763438-20&geniuslink=true&th=1" target="_blank">Yubico security key</a> and have two backups because a small security key is easy to lose. I don't recommend my way to anyone, even though it's easy and secure.</p><p><em><strong>What I do recommend is your fingerprint</strong></em>. Yes, I still think there has to be a better way, but until someone finds it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-well-does-the-galaxy-s25-detect-fake-fingerprints-or-facial-data">fingerprints work and are safe to use</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The top part of the invite features two images that show the blue glow of an Echo smart speaker's LED ring, next to it is Alexa's beaming blue light, both giving away subtle hints that upgrades are on the way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yyBBedkdnqVEh9JT2wZpZA" name="amazon-event2025-invite" alt="Amazon sends out invites for its annual tech event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyBBedkdnqVEh9JT2wZpZA.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Verge)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And the most prominent and exciting part of the invite is an image that cleverly shows a Kindle with a snippet of text that says, "with the stroke of a pen," which essentially means that Amazon could be bringing handwriting and stylus support, to the next Kindle Scribe, and this new device could feature color e-ink, which would be such a game changer for those yearning to read books and comics in the color that they were published in.</p><p>There is no doubt that Amazon could be focusing on integrating its AI into its hardware ecosystem. Earlier this year, the company gave Alexa a much-needed upgrade by launching the more conversational and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-announces-alexa-plus">intuitive Alexa Plus</a>, which can interact across different streaming, home devices, and shopping apps. While also effortlessly performing tasks like summarizing texts, emails, or complex topics.  And it is but obvious that the new devices will showcase this upgraded version of Alexa, featuring new capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75" name="echo-dot-with-clock-4th-gen-1.jpg" alt="Echo Dot With Clock 4th Gen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There has been recent chatter that Amazon is developing AR smart glasses to compete with Meta and Google.

It will have built-in microphones, speakers, a camera, and a full-color display only in one eye. We're hoping Amazon gives us a quick tease of these glasses as well.</p><p>Amazon skipped its big "Devices and Services" last year as it wanted to focus on bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-set-to-unveil-upgraded-home-and-entertainment-hardware-later-this-month/">advancements to Alexa</a>.

Amazon has attempted to remedy this issue by slashing up to $250 off the phone at various times over the past few months, which suggests to me that the discount will get even greater during Prime Big Deal Days. If I had to bet, I'd say that the 256GB S25 Ultra will drop to <strong>as low as $949.99</strong> during Amazon's big sale. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer-Whitesilver/dp/B0DP3GP92Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ad824ce2-75d3-4a47-8971-0898fe189ed6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" data-dimension48="Android Central Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="73b4bb83-094c-4a20-9ee0-dd63462e7b4b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central Review" data-dimension48="Android Central Review" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Smartphone-Assistant-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTV1LXZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe" name="Google-Pixel-10-render-Indigo-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>2.

If you aren't a member just yet, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for a 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of Prime, or simply wait to see what Amazon's competitors do. Walmart and Best Buy, for instance, are almost certain to launch their own sale events to coincide with October Prime Day, and these probably won't require a membership.</p> ]]></dc:content>

user the ability to interact with a simulated 3D space in real time. VR content is generally accessed through head-mounted displays called VR headsets. This technology has been around for decades (and was actually first introduced as a concept in science fiction!) but it didn’t reach the mainstream consumer market until somewhat recently, thanks to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-vr-headset-2">What is the best VR headset?</h2><p>The Meta Quest 3 is widely considered the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a>, thanks to its approachable design, excellent performance, and vast library of games. With a starting price of $499.99 for the 512GB headset, the Quest 3 might be a bit too expensive for some folks, which is why Meta has also introduced a more affordable device, the Meta Quest 3S. This $299.99 headset uses a lot of the same technology as its more-expensive sibling while settling for a lower-res display.</p><h2 id="is-vr-for-kids-2">Is VR for kids?</h2><p>VR headsets generally aren’t recommended for kids under the age of 12, largely because these youngsters still have developing eyes and brains. There is also an inherent physical risk to playing VR games, so it’s important that the children are mature enough to understand the dangers of wearing a VR headset. Once they reach an appropriate age, however, many young people have a great time using VR, thanks to the countless kid-friendly games and educational tools that are available.</p><h2 id="what-is-meta-connect-2">What is Meta Connect?</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta Connect</a> is an annual multi-day conference hosted by Meta, one of the leading producers of VR technology. It’s also the company that owns Instagram and Facebook. Every year, Meta uses this event to unveil its latest innovative technology, from VR headsets and smart glasses to advancements in AI and augmented reality (AR).</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has seemingly changed its profile icon to the suspected upcoming series in preparation for teaser material and its official launch. The device features a rather large external display on its rear panel that fully encompasses its two cameras.</p><p>While it's not completely edge-to-edge, the external display still appears to be a generous size, capable of showing a clock, and likely more from within Xiaomi's mobile OS.</p><p>Leica camera branding is also spotted right under this external display and camera array. The leaked top-half rendering suggests the device's physical buttons (power, volume rocker) will be placed on its right side. Moreover, the phone seems to have rounded corners, flat sides, and potentially a fully flat display. A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/09/xiaomi-17-pro-max-renders-leak-secondary-display.html">Android Headlines</a> chimed in, claiming that this rendering is of the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max.</p><p>Furthering this suspicion is a post on Weibo from the other day by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5211079585568720">the company's head, Lu Weibing</a>. Lu Weibing teased that the upcoming series is reportedly the Xiaomi 17, and will consist of the base 17 model, the Xiaomi 17 Pro, and the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. The post states the phone will rock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">recently confirmed</a> Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the successor to the Elite from 2024, when it launches "this month."</p><h2 id="xiaomi-s-making-moves-2">Xiaomi's making moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:598px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.33%;"><img id="QGReXn9D9m42js5bV7mZ6F" name="xiaomi-17-series-leaked-external-display-rendering" alt="A leaked rendering of the Xiaomi 17 series' external display, which resembles a large camera visor on its rear panel, with two camera lenses inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QGReXn9D9m42js5bV7mZ6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="598" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Why Lab / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi's head also teases that the 17 Pro will be a "sophisticated compact imaging flagship," while the 17 Pro Max is designed to be "the more powerful" flagship in the industry.</p><p>Earlier this month, an alleged live photo of Xiaomi's upcoming flagship series was posted online, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomis-next-phone-might-outshine-the-competition-with-a-second-screen-on-the-back">showing off this external display</a>. It was previously assumed that this would end up launching on the Xiaomi 16 series, but it seems things have since changed, and we're hoping up to 17, instead. Either way, an external display on a slab phone is something we haven't seen from Xiaomi since the Mi 11 Ultra days.</p><p>The device is expected to rock a triple camera setup: two lenses within the camera visor-esque external display, and a final lens right under it in a pill-shaped container. Specifications are still up in the air, but if Xiaomi is planning on a launch later in September, we won't have to wait that long.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both the Fenix 8 and Fenix 8 Pro are painfully expensive; if you're going to spend that much anyway, $100 extra — plus a monthly subscription — for peace of mind in emergencies is reasonable.

The biggest difference comes in the form of the design itself, as the Tab S11 Ultra is lighter than its predecessor, with Samsung managing to shave more than 30 grams off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3X7E9v7hUQbRD9XWS9pihW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3X7E9v7hUQbRD9XWS9pihW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of that can probably be attributed to another change, as there are no longer dual selfie cameras hidden in a notch on the screen. Instead, Samsung dropped the secondary lens, deciding to go with a single 12MP ultrawide camera. It might not make a difference for some, but it might matter to those who are constantly on video calls and enjoyed having the more flexible camera array.</p><p>Samsung has a knack for removing one feature just to offer a different, yet helpful change. So if you're disappointed with the Tab S11 Ultra only having one selfie camera, you might be happy to know that Samsung upgraded the battery over last year's model. The 11,600mAh battery, paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400's</a> expected efficiency gains, and this beast could last for days.</p><p>At the very least, you'll get a free storage upgrade, which alone is saving you more than $100. Seriously, this deal is beyond crazy, and time's running out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you do happen to recall Dyson's foray into making headphones, it's likely because of the Dyson Zone, a Bizarro-World contraption that combined over-ear headphones with an air-purifying mask during the global pandemic.</p><p>If you tuned out after that, I wouldn't blame you, but you'd be missing out on one of the coolest concepts in consumer audio today: the Dyson OnTrac. Unlike the Zone, the OnTrac are no gimmick. These headphones pair striking looks with solid sound quality and ANC performance. In a crowded market for over-ear headphones, Dyson separated the OnTrac from the rest by leaning into customization as their calling card.</p><p>We first reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a> in 2024, and in revisiting these headphones one year later, it's clear they still stand out. Considering you can frequently find them on sale — the Dyson OnTrac hit their lowest price ever at $260 on Amazon just last month — they're still a relevant pick for people looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">great ANC headphones</a>.</p><p>More importantly, I want more audio brands to take note of Dyson's customization offerings, and here's why.</p><h2 id="how-you-can-customize-the-dyson-ontrac-2">How you can customize the Dyson OnTrac</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yZjhi8pP5QWigr9PBhcqkJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-5" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yZjhi8pP5QWigr9PBhcqkJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the best headphones have replaceable ear cushions, and for good reason. If a set of ear cushions gets dirty or damaged, you can replace them for a reasonable cost without having to buy a new set of headphones. This is excellent from a user-repairability standpoint, but the goal here is not necessarily customization. Often, a headphone brand will only sell a color or two of replacement ear cushions, usually matching their basic colorways.</p><p>Dyson takes a different approach, designing the OnTrac ear cushions not just to be user-replaceable, but also to be user-customizable. There are nine different colors of ear cushions you can purchase, far more than the four colorways the Dyson OnTrac are sold in. The idea is that you can buy a pair of OnTrac and then make it your own with customizable cushions, turning Dyson's headset into as much of a fashion accessory as it is an audio product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oty2krAuTwT8Tv3KjtyhbJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-4" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oty2krAuTwT8Tv3KjtyhbJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dyson takes things a step further by letting users replace and customize the outer caps of the headphones, which is basically unheard of in the headphone market. You can twist the outer cap on your OnTrac to unlock it and pull it off the headphones. This will reveal a barebones look at the OnTrac, its shell, and its audio drivers (once the ear cushions are also removed). From there, you can slot in whichever outer cap material and color you'd like.</p><p>There are a total of 10 outer cap colors and finishes, including CNC Aluminum, CNC Copper, Titanium, and Ceramic. The versatility allows you to pick a headphone colorway that matches your style. Perhaps you want titanium headphones to go with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">titanium Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> phone, or you want a pink ceramic pair to go with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">peony Google Pixel 9</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDDfBCBLVJTaecEyooMrEK" name="Dyson-OnTrac-8" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDDfBCBLVJTaecEyooMrEK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Between the color of the headband (which you can only choose at purchase), the outer caps, and the ear cushions, there are over 2,000 different combinations of colors you can create with Dyson OnTrac. In a market where far too many of the best headphones are only sold in black or white, this is unparalleled customization.</p><h2 id="a-twist-on-headphone-repairability-and-modularity-2">A twist on headphone repairability and modularity </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wnkgiBWxmBGpRrT7PPEpzJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-2" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnkgiBWxmBGpRrT7PPEpzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, changing out the outer cap or ear cushion on your headphones won't improve sound quality or bring any tangible benefit to the listening experience. Audiophiles, look away. But headphones have become as much of a fashion statement as they are an audio product in recent years.</p><p>If you don't believe me, go to the gym and count how many people you see working out with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> — they're probably the worst tool for the job, and yet they're prolific. It's because of their looks and the status symbol they bring.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zSVjFM9SyRy9DiemdzkJpR" name="Dyson-OnTrac-3" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSVjFM9SyRy9DiemdzkJpR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's refreshing to see a company recognize that tech is fashion, and lean into that identity. Customizing these headphones isn't cheap, with each set of ear cushions or outer caps costing $50 each. Still, it's fantastic to have the option. Even if you wait until your ear cushions are worn out or your outer caps are scuffed up to replace them, it'll still be fun to choose a new colorway a year or two down the line.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hHAyaXgU25Mm9Fn4HA3RyJ" name="Dyson-OnTrac-6" alt="The Dyson OnTrac headphones with a mix of silver and copper caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHAyaXgU25Mm9Fn4HA3RyJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Being able to freshen up a few-year-old pair of headphones with something new might save you from feeling the need to buy a whole new pair, reducing overconsumption and keeping some cash in your pocket.

Google unveiled its flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> back in August, while Apple has now officially introduced the iPhone 17 lineup as well.</p><p>Both the Pixel 10 and iPhone 17 are major upgrades over their predecessors, even if it doesn't look that way on paper. The Google Pixel 10 adds an extra zoom lens and new AI features, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/pwm-accessibility-toggle-iphone-17-display">iPhone 17</a> brings an improved selfie camera and new anti-reflective glass up front.</p><p>Thankfully, both brands have kept the same $799 starting price for their entry-level flagships, making this comparison even more interesting. So, between the iPhone 17 vs. Pixel 10, which is the better fit for you? Let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-pricing-colors-and-availability-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Pricing, colors, and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5" name="iphone-17-lineup-pricing-breakdown" alt="Apple's iPhone lineup with pricing following iPhone 17 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After months of leaks, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 17 lineup at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">"Awe Dropping" event</a> on September 9, 2025. The iPhone 17 starts at the same $799 price as the iPhone 16 base model. This time, however, Apple has bumped the base storage to 256GB, with a 512GB variant also available for $999.</p><p>The iPhone 17 comes in five colors: Lavender (purple), Sage (green), Mist Blue, White, and Black. Pre-orders for the iPhone 17 begin Friday, September 12, with availability in stores starting September 19, 2025.</p><p>Google, on the other hand, took the wraps off the Pixel 10 series about three weeks earlier at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-2025-live-blog-pixel-10-pixel-watch-4-android-16">Made by Google event</a> on August 20, 2025. The baseline Pixel 10 also starts at $799 in the US. However, the base Pixel 10 comes with just 128GB of storage, with only one upgrade option to 256GB — there is no 512GB variant available.</p><p>The Pixel 10 is offered in four colors: Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, and Obsidian, and is available for purchase immediately through carriers and major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MfLMti8entmazo5cVREAe" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-15" alt="Pixel 10 leaning against a pillar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MfLMti8entmazo5cVREAe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the iPhone 17 and the Google Pixel 10 adopt a very similar design language. Both are rectangular slab smartphones with a glass-sandwich build, curved corners, and flat-edged frames. But once you turn to the back, the differences appear.</p><p>The iPhone 17 continues with the same vertical camera setup on the top left as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-you-probably-should-not-mind-iphone-16-complaints">iPhone 16</a>, while the Pixel 10 carries its signature horizontal camera visor across the back, housing the camera sensors and temperature sensor. Both devices also feature their company logos centered on the rear.</p><p>In terms of dimensions, the Google Pixel 10 is slightly wider, thicker, and heavier than the iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch display and measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm, while the Pixel 10 also has a 6.3-inch display but measures 152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm.</p><p>Another key difference in hand feel is weight. The iPhone 17 is lighter at 177 grams, while the Pixel 10 comes in at 204 grams. The Pixel makes up for it, though, with an extra camera lens and a bigger battery, but more on that later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of durability, both phones are quite comparable. The Pixel 10 uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2, while the iPhone 17 uses Apple’s new Ceramic Shield 2. Both are also IP68 rated, meaning they can handle rain or shallow water immersion for up to 30 minutes.</p><p>One iPhone-exclusive feature that has now made its way to the Pixel 10 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic wireless charging</a>. Both the iPhone 17 and Pixel 10 feature magnets on the back, so you can use magnetic chargers, power banks, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> like mounts and wallets without third-party cases or stickers.</p><p>Another iPhone-inspired move, though not necessarily a plus, is the removal of physical SIM trays. Both the iPhone 17 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 are eSIM-only</a> in the United States, with no SIM card slots available.</p><p>Up front is where the iPhone 17 sees major upgrades. For the first time, the base iPhone gets Apple's ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, something Android phones, including Pixels, have offered for years. It also features a 6.3-inch Super XDR OLED panel with up to 3,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>However, one of the big upgrades on the iPhone 17's display this year is the addition of an anti-reflective coating, similar to what we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. This should make it easier to view the phone outdoors with less glare.</p><p>The Pixel 10 similarly offers a 6.3-inch OLED display with 120Hz refresh, 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and HDR10+ playback support.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-hardware-specs-and-software-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Hardware, specs, and software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3859px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="D4REekkFrL2YFzA8ppu4vX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Lemongrass-camera-bar-2" alt="Pixel 10 camera bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D4REekkFrL2YFzA8ppu4vX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3859" height="2171" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple has always led when it comes to smartphone processors, and the company doubles down with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 chipset</a> on the iPhone 17. Similar to the A18 from the previous generation, the A19 is based on a 3nm process, but Apple claims it is now "fast and efficient" and tailored to power on-device AI features.</p><p>And Apple has something to show for it. The company has built what it calls "neural accelerators" into the A19's GPU, which should further improve on-device AI performance, especially with help from the 16-core Neural Engine. In raw performance, Apple claims up to 80% better graphics than the iPhone 15.</p><p>Now, the hardware has always been where Google Pixels lag behind iPhones. While Google has tried to catch up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> on the Pixel 10, it still falls short.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aHK8zmGZKLcbKh4ns9xDaP" name="apple-a19-chipset" alt="Graphic of the Apple A19 chipset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aHK8zmGZKLcbKh4ns9xDaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rumors were true: Google switched from Samsung Foundry to TSMC for manufacturing the Tensor G5 on a 3nm process. While this should theoretically improve sustained performance and efficiency, Tensor G5's benchmarks show the Pixel 10 still trails other Android competitors and the iPhone.</p><p>Hardware has never been Google's strong suit, as the company focuses more on user experience and software — and that remains true for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Google hit the numbers it wanted, with the Tensor G5's TPU 60% faster for on-device AI tasks and the CPU 40% faster than the Pixel 9's Tensor G4. Early results also suggest better performance, but if you're buying a device for gaming or video editing, you're probably better off with the iPhone 17.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Actua OLED, 120Hz, 1080 x 2424, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto (5x) + 13MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,970 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>30W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p>Pixelsnap wireless charging (Qi2, 15W)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm; 204g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Another interesting upgrade on the iPhone 17, something we wish Google had adopted on the Pixel 10 series, is the bump to base storage of 256GB. The iPhone 17 comes in two variants, 256GB and 512GB, while the Pixel 10 only offers 128GB and 256GB. Of course, neither phone includes a microSD slot for storage expansion.</p><p>In terms of battery capacity, the Pixel 10 takes the lead. It ships with a 4,970 mAh cell, while even though Apple increased the size of the iPhone 17, it's still lower at 3,692 mAh. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">The Pixel 10 supports 30W fast charging</a>, while Apple has added dynamic 40W–60W support on the iPhone 17.</p><p>Apple claims the iPhone 17 can charge from 0–50% in about 20 minutes, while the Pixel 10 takes closer to 30. For wireless charging, both phones support Qi2 magnetic wireless charging, but the iPhone 17 offers faster 25W charging compared to the Pixel 10's 15W.</p><p>Of course, actual battery life depends on usage, but so far, I've been pretty impressed with the Pixel 10, while I'm yet to test the iPhone 17.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ywsbeetJV7LuRWPVP2tr3h" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-29" alt="Pixel 10 Magic Cue suggestion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywsbeetJV7LuRWPVP2tr3h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning to software, as we know, the two phones ship with completely different OSes. The Pixel 10 comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> and Google's new bold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a>. The iPhone 17 runs iOS 26 with Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass design language</a>. It's personal preference, but I find Android 16's look more appealing than Liquid Glass.</p><p>As expected, Google leans heavily into AI and software features, and the Pixel 10 is no exception. It includes several new tools you won't find on any other phone, like Camera Coach to guide better photos, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Magic Cue</a> to surface info when you need it, and features like Daily Hub, Pixel Screenshots, and more. These are some of the features that are not available on the iPhone 17.</p><p>In fact, when it comes to the iPhone 17, Apple strangely didn't even mention Apple Intelligence — its suite of AI features — on stage at the keynote. Apple has clearly fallen behind in AI features and in rolling them out for users.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-cameras-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f26WpiwBjWToUDa2NTpXjf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-19" alt="Camera Coach on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f26WpiwBjWToUDa2NTpXjf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, moving on to the cameras, and this is where most people are most interested. Both iPhones and Google Pixels are known for offering some of the most consistent cameras on smartphones, but this year, based purely on hardware, Google seems to have taken the lead.</p><p>The Pixel 10 ships with a triple-camera setup on the back. This includes a 48MP primary camera, a 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. With the company's Pro Res Zoom and Gemini AI, the Pixel 10 can even achieve up to 20x digital zoom.</p><p>This is the first time Google has added a telephoto zoom lens to the baseline Pixel, something the iPhone 17 lacks.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0

But without a telephoto lens, the only optical zoom you get is 2x, achieved by cropping into the main sensor.</p><p>Of course, we can't just compare hardware, but based on hardware alone, the Pixel 10 takes the lead. We're still waiting, though, to see how these cameras compare in real-world use.</p><p>What's upgraded on the iPhone 17 is the main selfie shooter up front. It now features an 18MP front-facing camera with OIS and PDAF. The new addition is that this camera is multi-aspect, meaning it's wide enough that even when holding the phone vertically, you can snap selfies in landscape mode — something Google Pixels don't offer.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10-which-should-you-buy-2">iPhone 17 vs. Google Pixel 10: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3998px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-hero-1" alt="Holding the Pixel 10 outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TpcF4QbVJgXA4fbDkbb4Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3998" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, between the iPhone 17 and the Pixel 10, which one should you buy? As always, comparing the two isn't like comparing <em>apples</em> and oranges. Instead, these phones are designed for different users with different priorities in mind.</p><p>At the top of that list is the OS. Some people prefer Android, while others prefer iOS. And while it will always remain a major differentiating factor when opting for either a Google Pixel or an iPhone, for the first time in years, it feels like buying the baseline entry-level model from both Apple and Google is genuinely worth it.</p><p>Google has upgraded the Pixel 10 to the point where it finally feels like a complete flagship without pushing you to upgrade to the Pro. Additions like Qi2 wireless charging, a much-improved Tensor G5 chipset, a 5x telephoto zoom camera, and plenty of helpful software features make it a phone that won't let you down.</p><p>On the other hand, the iPhone 17 is also a major upgrade with the long-awaited 120Hz refresh rate, faster charging, the powerful Apple A19 chipset, and an improved selfie camera. Altogether, the baseline iPhone now feels far less compromised compared to the Pro models.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="40323473-5a72-4eea-a6f0-1a2c8a010b59">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17/" data-model-name="Apple iPhone 17" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Real upgrade delivered</strong></em></p><p>The Apple iPhone 17 is a big step up from the iPhone 16.

All three phones in the flagship line — which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem.

The S26 Edge is rumored to jump to 4,200 mAh from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge.

It’s seriously heavy-duty, with a flexible silicone and braided cloth-covered cable that connects the USB-C end to the 3.5mm ported DAC.

Not a problem that a little EQ can’t fix! They have no inline mic for calls, but they look good, come with memory foam, and have two types of silicone ear tips.</p><p>For headgear, Snyder likes KZ Audio’s KZ ZSN Pro X. He says these $21.59 IEMs cost less than a meal these days and sound superb for the price. “I find the wrap-around cable design paired with the silicone ear tips to be very comfortable, and like that the cord itself is detachable if you need to replace or customize it.”</p><p>Snyder characterizes the sound quality as “firmly good enough” for his casual listening sessions. You can get out the door with both of his recs for under $60! Not bad.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N3etMayJdAu5CH9XMwn9tX" name="sennheiser-660S2-momentum-4-iFi-DACs-group-shot-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser headphones and iFi DACs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N3etMayJdAu5CH9XMwn9tX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">iFi Go Link on the left </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/tshaka-armstrong" target="_blank">my own</a> budget recommendation, I’m going with the iFi Go Link USB-C DAC ($59.99). It has a beautiful alloy body, with a nice braided cable. Its sound signature is pretty neutral, with an enjoyable soundstage, and sparkle in the treble that gives music a live feeling.</p><p>For something to connect to those DACs, I’m going to recommend the Sennheiser CX 300S in-ear headphones with inline calling and playback controls. Since you’re looking at budget earbuds, $38.90 on Amazon for the red version fits the bill!</p><p>Bass is ok, while mids and highs are a bit more forward, giving you solid clarity when it comes to vocals. Between the two, you should get what you need to enjoy lossless for around $100, with tax. If that’s still a bit of a hurdle, you can’t go wrong with FiiO’s KA11 dongle DAC.</p><h2 id="entry-level-upgrades-2">Entry-level upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ" name="iem-hero-1.jpg" alt="IEM hero shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaG7xEfVpfnA7UFQDNGxRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Harish gets us started again with his DAC upgrade, the FiiO BTR17 Bluetooth 5.4 USB-C DAC AMP ($220). It supports not only wired connections but LDAC and aptX Lossless. It’s a powerhouse with 3.5mm and the more powerful 4.4mm connections, so it will grow with you, and you get a desktop mode, which helps extend the life of the battery. This is a relatively inexpensive DAC with some flagship features that sounds great!</p><p>For your IEM, he’s recommending the TIN HiFi P1 Max II, which has 14.2mm planar drivers. They come with a 3.5mm cable, no inline microphone</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MjZk27666bq3EbJBENA8NQ" name="tinhifi-p1-max-4.jpg" alt="TinHiFi P1 Max review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MjZk27666bq3EbJBENA8NQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">TIN HiFI P1 Max II </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brady’s upgrade picks are the venerable Sennheiser HD600 and FiiO KA15. He says the former can reach high volumes when paired with a decent DAC and adapt to a variety of genres, making them versatile entry-level headphones for audiophiles. They have soft ear cushions with an adjustable headband that he calls “perfect for long listening sessions without discomfort.”</p><p>While he hasn't used the KA15, he notes that "it's the natural upgrade from the KA11 that I love. This DAC is a bit bigger, but you get higher balanced output power delivery for higher-impedance headphones, plus support for up to 768kHz/32bit and DSD256 sampling rates — more than enough for Spotify's lossless audio. I also can't help but enjoy the small screen and the shape that makes the KA15 look like a vintage cassette player.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Gz29NLNVAcWqJBSbU6AX25" name="hidisz-mk12-ap80-group-hero.JPG" alt="Hidizs MK12 Turris and AP80 PRO-X group shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gz29NLNVAcWqJBSbU6AX25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The upgrade I’m going to recommend is brand new on the market — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hidizs.net/products/hidizs-mk12-turris-12mm-large-91-magnesium-diaphragm-hifi-in-ear-monitors">Hidizs MK12 Turris</a> IEMs (pictured above).

The Go Blu is still one of my favorite DAC/Amps to date. It has an expansive soundstage, bright, crisp highs, and the ability to go from warm to deep, dark, rumbly bass with iFi’s X-Bass feature. It’s a beautifully designed, easily pocketable DAC with exemplary fit and finish.</p><p>Best of all, it can be used as a Bluetooth connection to connect your phone to the IEMs wirelessly, and has a built-in microphone for phone calls!</p><p>There are definitely pricier options out there for you if you want to get the most out of lossless listening. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s3-review" target="_blank">B&W’s top-tier Px7 S3 that I recently reviewed</a> really doesn't require a DAC, since they have a built-in DAC that does a great job with sound reproduction!</p><p>If you really want a DAC, or even a higher-end Android-based MP3 player, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-questyle-m18i" target="_blank">Questyle’s M18i</a> is brilliant, and the FiiO M21 digital audio player is the best DAP on the market under $500 right now.

In fact, the Xperia 10 VII's design choice is clearly inspired by Google’s Pixel lineup.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VII delivers the first big design revamp the 10 series has seen in years, even while keeping Sony’s usual bezels and overall layout. The biggest visual change is the camera: instead of the familiar vertical strip, the Xperia 10 VII adopts a pill-shaped horizontal camera bar that instantly makes it look different from its predecessors.</p><p>The phone features a new 1/1.56-inch main sensor alongside a 1/3-inch ultrawide lens, though the MP count is missing from the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.eu/presscentre/sony-reimagines-its-10-series-with-xperia-10-vii" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p><p>Around the front, the 6.1-inch FullHD+ OLED now supports a 120 Hz refresh rate and is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6UzB45fKREKdFdTzDccvPg" name="Sony-Xperia-10-VII-screen-and-rear" alt="Sony Xperia 10 VII screen and rear panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6UzB45fKREKdFdTzDccvPg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="old-school-perks-that-still-matter-2">Old-school perks that still matter</h2><p>The Xperia 10 VII also makes a quiet argument for practicality and keeps hardware perks you rarely see anymore. It packs upgraded stereo speakers up front and a 3.5mm headphone jack. For anyone who wants a phone with real flexibility and full-featured hardware, this one’s hard to ignore.</p><p>Under the hood, Sony has moved to Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-6s-gen-3">Snapdragon 6 Gen 3</a> chip with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, expandable up to 2TB via microSD.</p><p>A 5,000 mAh battery keeps everything running, though charging speeds aren’t aiming to impress. Sony also introduced an “Adaptive Charging” feature meant to keep the battery from wearing out even after four years, but it hasn’t revealed how it actually works.</p><p>The build remains classic Sony, with IP65/68 water and dust resistance and a physical shutter button for quick camera access.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VII comes in at 153 x 72 x 8.3 mm, making it a bit wider and shorter than the last model, and it weighs 169 g.</p><p>On the software side, Sony promises four years of OS updates and six years of security patches, which is a standout commitment in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1140px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ykNxK3R3FBhpwVFRz3Xrg4" name="Sony-Xperia-10-VII-camera" alt="camera viewfinder of the Xperia 10 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykNxK3R3FBhpwVFRz3Xrg4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1140" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="mid-range-pricing-limited-availability-2">Mid-range pricing, limited availability</h2><p>Despite the above-mentioned design changes, the phone still clings to noticeable top and bottom bezels, and its availability outside Europe and Asia could be limited.
