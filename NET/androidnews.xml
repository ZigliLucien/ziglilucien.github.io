                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a>, Nothing proved that it knows how to make terrific budget phones. The brand's unique design philosophy combined with its focus on delivering a great value allowed it to carve out a niche in markets like India, and that's no small feat.</p><p>Nothing is now aiming to emulate the same with the Phone 3, a flagship that's designed to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, Xiaomi 15, and the Pixel 9. At the outset, there's plenty to like with the phone; it retains Nothing's design ethos, and you get a new Glyph Matrix pattern at the back with better usability.</p><p>The software is among the best of any phone you'll find in 2025, with Nothing delivering a clean interface that's vibrant and playful — just like the hardware design — along with useful additions like Essential Space.</p><p>But the biggest downside has to do with the hardware; the Phone 3 misses out on Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and is instead powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, a mid-range platform seen on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-review">POCO F7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a>. It isn't just the chipset either; you don't get many of the features available on Chinese rivals, like IP69 water resistance.</p><p>Combine all of that with the $799 asking price, and the Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as its budget-focused siblings. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great overall phone, but it just isn't worth the price — not when there are better alternatives available.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing unveiled the Phone 3 at a launch event in London on July 1, and the phone is now up for pre-order, with availability starting July 15. Unlike Nothing's other phones, the Phone 3 is sold in the U.S., a welcome move. It costs $799 for the 12GB/256GB version, and $899 for the 16GB/512GB model.</p><p>Over in India, the Phone 3 starts at ₹79,999 ($933) for the 12GB/256GB model, and ₹89,999 ($1,050) for the 16GB/512GB edition. In the U.K., the Phone 3 is sold at £799 ($1,088) for the 12GB/256GB model, and £899 ($1,224) for the 16GB/512GB variant. In other parts of Europe, you'll need to shell out €799 ($937) to get the 12GB/256GB model, and €899 ($1,055) for the 16GB/512GB configuration.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.67-inch 120Hz OLED, Gorilla Glass 7i, 1,600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, Adreno 825, 4nm node</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP  f/2.7 ISOCELL JN5, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ISOCELL JN1, 4K60 video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, Dual-band GPS, AptX HD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery (5,500mAh in India), 65W USB PD charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm, 218g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-design"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pctuFpho5MmEA2vPS77iVR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pctuFpho5MmEA2vPS77iVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The Phone 3 gets a new design, but it still maintains the Nothing ethos. </strong></li><li><strong>The highlight is a new LED dot matrix grid at the back that's highly customizable. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone is heavier than its rivals, but still has a good in-hand feel. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Phone coverage</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro review</a></p></div></div><p>The Phone 3 showcases the evolution of Nothing's design language; while it isn't as flamboyant as its predecessors, it still retains the same ethos — and it's just as distinctive.

There's a button at the back that lets you interact with the Glyph Matrix, essentially allowing you to cycle between the options available. It is well-thought-out, and definitely adds to the quirkiness of the device without being gimmicky. You can even use the grid as a fill light.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7eAWSHMd6AKPC4yM25ocSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is a definite step up over the LED lighting that was seen on the Phone 1 and Phone 2, and you get various Glyph Toys, such as a digital clock, stopwatch, a spin the bottle game, volume indicator, battery indicator, and so on.

At 218g, it is heavier than other devices in this category, but it isn't unwieldy to use even though it has flat sides. Nothing did all the right things with material choices; the Phone 3 has an aluminum mid-frame and a glass back that's protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ese7ry9qnk94f3kqtJV8GR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ese7ry9qnk94f3kqtJV8GR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4990" height="2811" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another new addition is the Essential Key that sits below the power button; you use it to launch Essential Space, a "second memory" that lets you store just about everything with just the press of a button.

That means the phone doesn't go any lower than 30Hz when viewing static content; most other devices in this category go to 1Hz.</p><p>The panel itself is vibrant, and it has great color accuracy. You don't get much in the way of customizability — there are just two color modes available — but you can manually alter the warmth of the panel. It has HDR10+ by default, and uses Android's built-in Ultra HDR standard when viewing photos and videos.

Like most flagships, the device uses a 10% silicon-carbon tech in the anode, delivering better energy density and longevity. The phone lasts all day on a full charge, and even with heavy use, I didn't need to plug in the device before the end of the day. It has 65W charging and takes just under an hour to charge the battery, but it goes to 50% in just over 22 minutes.</p><p>There's no charger included in the package, but as the device uses the standard USB PD 3.0 power profiles, you can use any PD GaN charger — I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/ugreen-nexode-500w-gan-charging-station-ultimate-upgrade">Nexode 500W charging station</a>.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-cameras"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DerBGvKbF28Q7Tcbv23E9R" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DerBGvKbF28Q7Tcbv23E9R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The phone has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back and a 50MP lens at the front. </strong></li><li><strong>It has the best cameras of any Nothing phone, and takes good photos/videos. </strong></li><li><strong>However, it doesn't hold its own against Chinese rivals. </strong></li></ul><p>Nothing has a quartet of 50MP cameras on the back of the Phone 3.

There's also a 50MP f/2.2 Samsung ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle lens, and Nothing outfitted the same 50MP JN1 module as the selfie lens.</p><p>The camera interface is minimal, you get the standard shooting modes in a grid at the bottom, and toggles to switch between the lenses. You don't get much in the way of filters or additional shooting modes, but the basics are covered. The phone gets 4K60 HDR video with all four sensors, and that's good to see.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

Resultant shots have good color balance and detail, and they're not overly saturated. Foliage is rendered well, and there isn't any aggressive smoothing. The phone does really well in low-light scenarios as well, producing vivid images with little to no visible noise.</p><p>The tele lens is good in its own right, delivering usable shots at up to 6x. It doesn't quite have the same tonal balance as the main camera, but it is a decent showing nevertheless. The main camera does well with portrait shots as well, but you don't get the same level of bokeh as other phones.</p><p>While the Phone 3 has the best camera package of any Nothing phone, it doesn't measure up to its Chinese rivals. The Vivo X200, X200 Pro, Xiaomi 15, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and OnePlus 13 all outmatch the Phone 3 when it comes to taking photos and videos, and Nothing still has some ways to go before it can hold its own in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-software"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Nothing OS 3.5 has a clean interface with bold colors and unique widgets. </strong></li><li><strong>The software is fun to use, and it is one of my favorite skins. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone isn't launching with Android 16. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related links</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2 review</a></p></div></div><p>Nothing has one of the best software interfaces of any Android phone currently available.

It excels at the basics, and while the design doesn't stand out, you get incredible hardware and battery life, and the software is pretty good — if not on the same level as the Phone 3. Where the iQOO 13 shines is the value — there just isn't another phone that gives you as much for your money.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5084px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WB5TwAh7WTsyuh8txznEBR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WB5TwAh7WTsyuh8txznEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5084" height="2864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want a phone with a distinctive design</li><li>You prioritize software over hardware</li><li>You want a phone with good battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want the fastest internals</li><li>You need the best cameras</li><li>You want a true flagship</li></ul><p>The fact that Nothing managed to launch a phone with this level of sophistication is an achievement in and of itself. The Phone 3 has a unique design, great software with fun widgets and AI utilities that you'll actually use, and cameras that are much better than any other Nothing phone until now.</p><p>However, it just isn't worth the asking price — not when there are more capable alternatives available. At the end of the day, that's the biggest limiting factor with the Phone 3; it isn't a bad phone by any measure, but it doesn't stand out meaningfully against other flagships.</p><p>I get that Nothing isn't chasing specs and instead trying to differentiate the Phone 3 with a bold design and clean software, and that is evident when using the device. Although it doesn't have the best hardware, the Phone 3 is fluid in daily use, it delivers good photos and videos, and lasts all day. But the OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13 do the same, and ultimately, they're a better value.</p><p>If you like what Nothing is trying to achieve with the Phone 3 and don't mind some of the omissions, then you should get the device — it is a refreshing change of pace from other phones I tested in 2025. But if you want a true flagship, you'll need to look elsewhere.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5f3507d6-2b4a-4311-a8f0-a0537282dcc3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YePoe5yoNNw8rzpgquX8dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the white Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as previous Nothing phones, but if that isn't an issue, you're getting a great package. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

One of OnePlus's marketing points was that it was the first phone in the U.S. with an IP69 rating, something even the Galaxy S25 family didn't include when it launched a month later. But what does that really do for you?</p><p>Last week, I read a story about a OnePlus 13 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/someone-accidentally-tried-drowning-the-oneplus-13-and-it-didnt-flinch">ended up in a river for four and a half hours</a> without taking any damage, so I figured I would put it through my own test by taking the phone on the lake all day during the Fourth of July. Unsurprisingly, the phone passed with flying colors. Everyone else left their iPhones and Galaxy phones on the boat, but I floated in the water, taking perfect pictures the entire day with my OnePlus 13.</p><p>What better timing to do this, too, because the 512GB OnePlus 13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ/sku/6609353"><strong>on sale for $150 off</strong></a> at Best Buy during the company's Black Friday in July event.

In addition to the longest software update commitments ever, companies like OnePlus and Honor have built smartphones equipped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">to survive a kitchen nightmare</a>.</p><p>I've already put the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher several times and took it in a 155-degree Fahrenheit sauna for half an hour to test its durability, but taking it swimming all day is another feat entirely. Part of the problem is that, while many phones have featured IP68 water and dust resistance for years, that durability doesn't include "water jets" or moving water, which means you're not really supposed to actively swim with them.</p><p>IP69 changes all of that, and it means taking the OnePlus 13 in a river or lake was no big deal at all. The phone stayed in my zipped-up swimming pants pocket most of the time while I was in the lake and only came out when I wanted to take a picture. Not only does the phone withstand water for long periods of time, but Aqua Touch 2.0 ensures you can actually <em>touch</em> the screen even with wet fingers. Good luck doing that on an iPhone!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-2" alt="A collage of four photos taken from a OnePlus 13 while swimming in a lake on July 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Taking the phone in the water was a thing of joy.

When the sun hit the water just right and turned it into "Mountain Dew water" under the boat around sunset, the OnePlus 13 perfectly captured that moment, too.</p><p>As the lighting dimmed and we headed in for dinner and s'mores, the OnePlus 13 captured the mood perfectly. I love using the portrait mode on the camera for people <em>and</em> food photos, and it even captured the dock lighting for an Instagram-worthy moment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-1" alt="A montage of photos captured by the OnePlus 13 on July 4, capturing fireworks, food, and mood lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the long day finally started to get dark, we rode the boat over to the main harbor where a fireworks show was scheduled. The OnePlus 13 ships with many different camera modes, and while I was taking photos of the fireworks across the water, the camera app suggested I switch to fireworks mode to more accurately capture the scene.</p><p>Boy, that was a great decision. It's nice to have a camera that's smart enough to suggest when different modes would be best to use, and the fireworks mode does a much better job of capturing the stark contrast between the bright fireworks and the otherwise dark lake scene.</p><p>As you've probably experienced before, the left image below isn't at all what it looked like to my eyes in real life. Rather, it was much more like the right image, and while the timing of my shot doesn't do the display justice, it still gives me a good memory to look back at down the road.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.85%;"><img id="cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo" name="oneplus-13-july-4-fireworks-mode" alt="Comparing the default photo mode and the fireworks mode on the OnePlus 13's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6144" height="4353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't normally do a ton for holidays like the Fourth of July, and I couldn't be happier that I had a phone like the OnePlus 13 to take with me on the year we finally get the chance to do something as epic as boating on the lake for the whole day.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is my favorite Android phone of all time for many reasons, but its versatility and durability are among the best reasons.

It's substantially smaller and lighter than the bigger OnePlus Watch 3, weighing 21g less, according to my scale.</p><p>Its 60g weight still isn't as light as the Pixel Watch 3 41mm's 46g, but having a bigger battery and <em>slightly</em> larger display is better than the 14g Google saved on that design. It feels like a Goldilocks product in that regard.</p><p>And while the weight and physical size difference are excellent improvements for this size, it's the physical design changes I like the most. It's also worth noting that OnePlus improved the brightness of the 43mm version over the larger model, something that's most apparent outdoors.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2uKzpibKMLd4WJmsZWrJMM" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-front" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2uKzpibKMLd4WJmsZWrJMM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="y7cca9nATD8fYveWMTreCM" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-side" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y7cca9nATD8fYveWMTreCM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UsiEjAU8uaKLTMLDDyvTgL" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-side-wearing-02" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UsiEjAU8uaKLTMLDDyvTgL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The pre-installed band lies completely flat, unlike the OnePlus Watch 3. Even if you get a different band for the bigger watch, the lines on the watch look funny without a curved band. Not the case for the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm.</p><p>I also love that there's no "sidebar" on the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm, as I'll call it, that offsets the OnePlus Watch 3's buttons. This makes the design for the 43mm variant a totally uniform circle, with only the crown button protruding from the top right. This crown is wonderfully designed and works just like the larger OnePlus Watch 3, excellent haptics included.</p><p>The offset crown means you won't accidentally press the button while working out or leaning on something, a problem that happens all the time for me on the Pixel Watch 3 unless I turn it backward.</p><h2 id="health-tracking-and-battery-life-2">Health tracking and battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGfcvfYHUEsnCNoyEy7G79" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-display-brightness" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm next to each other, about to track a workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGfcvfYHUEsnCNoyEy7G79.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the weight and size are huge positives, OnePlus had to compromise on the battery size and health tracking capabilities of the smaller OnePlus Watch 3 to reduce its size. While U.S. customers have never been able to enjoy the 60-second health checkup feature on the OnePlus Watch 3 due to a lack of FDA approval, the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm doesn't have the feature in any market.</p><p>OnePlus tells us that this is "due to the lack of a temperature sensor and vascular health tracking functionality in the Watch 3 43mm." In other words, there's no software fix for missing hardware. Whether or not you'll use these features is another story, but they're not on the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm, while the larger Watch 3 has them.</p><p>Thankfully, workout tracking is just as good as the bigger OnePlus Watch 3, and I found no notable differences in the capabilities of the smaller watch for heart rate or GPS tracking.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WhXBRg7mS2AAFcK3NcbeGD" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-vs-46mm-back" alt="Comparing the backsides of the OnePlus Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WhXBRg7mS2AAFcK3NcbeGD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="njWi3cxkX7MAMi66gFT4Pa" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-side-01" alt="The side buttons of the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njWi3cxkX7MAMi66gFT4Pa.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One of <em>the</em> primary reasons to choose a OnePlus Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">over other Wear OS watches</a> is its impressive battery life. With an average of 5 days of usage per charge, there's simply no competition on the market. As you might have guessed, the 43mm version doesn't last quite as long on a charge.</p><p>Instead of 5 days, you're looking at a full 2 days on a single charge. Light users who don't use sleep or health tracking features much might be able to make it through a third day, but most people won't. Thankfully, the 43mm version still uses the ultra-fast Super VOOC charging OnePlus devices are famous for.</p><p>While it's no match for the larger OnePlus Watch 3, its battery life still outperforms the best Galaxy or Pixel watches of the same size. That's especially true when using battery saver mode, which simplifies the watch by using an entirely separate operating system, all without sacrificing health or GPS tracking features. With this feature enabled, you'll get approximately a week, even when using all the available functions in RTOS.</p><h2 id="a-truly-great-wear-os-watch-2">A truly great Wear OS watch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qy4KXzUjCfJLJhAFFfpSij" name="oneplus-watch-3-43mm-wearing-changing-watch-face" alt="Changing the watch face on a OnePlus Watch 3 43mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy4KXzUjCfJLJhAFFfpSij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to buy any one Wear OS watch today, it would be a choice between the two available OnePlus Watch 3 sizes.

It allows the watch to remain fast and capable, all while delivering superior battery life.</p><p>The biggest draw of using Wear OS over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Garmin watches</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Amazfit watches</a> is the app selection, in addition to the deep tie-ins with Android's notification system.

The Buds 4 have more in common with the standout Buds Pro 3 than you'd expect, including a full soundstage with deep bass. Plus, they bring along active-noise canceling (ANC), adaptive, and transparency modes.</p><p>The most attractive part of the OnePlus Buds 4 are their price: the earbuds retail for $129.99. In typical OnePlus fashion, you can already save big on the Buds 4, using code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> on the brand's website to immediately take $30 off the sticker price for a limited time. That would make the Buds 4 just under $100, which is extremely competitive at a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day deals</a> are offering big savings on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>That's where things get tricky. The price is both the best and worst thing about the OnePlus Buds 4. Getting these earbuds for around $100 is a steal, but at their full retail price, they're competing with OnePlus' own Buds Pro 3 for just a bit more. While I thoroughly enjoyed testing the Buds 4, I'd pay a bit more for the premium feel and feature set of the Buds Pro 3 every time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-price-and-availability"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WLNw6d5WNSgmVvbuoEtRWQ" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-12" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside their case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLNw6d5WNSgmVvbuoEtRWQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Buds 4 are officially available for purchase as of July 8, 2025 on OnePlus' online store. They retail for $129.99 in the U.S. and $169.99 CAD in Canada. You can get the Buds 4 in a Storm Gray or Zen Green colorways, both of which feature metal and glossy finishes. From now through July 31, 2025, buyers can save $30 with code <strong>ONEPLUSBUDS4</strong> on OnePlus' website for a limited time.</p><p>For now, the OnePlus Buds 4 are exclusively being sold directly through OnePlus. Starting in August 2025, there will be wider availability through third-party retailers, including Best Buy and Amazon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/product/oneplus-buds-4" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">OnePlus Buds 4 at OnePlus for $129.99 ($30 off with code)</a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-what-s-good"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k7HHjogyQT8jtC8JvZPpjN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-9" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray sitting atop a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7HHjogyQT8jtC8JvZPpjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buying guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones"><strong>Best OnePlus phones</strong></a></p></div></div><p>I've spent a year praising the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, because while they're not the absolute best-sounding earbuds, they're certainly the best value. Naturally, I expected switching to the OnePlus Buds 4 to come with a noticeable drop-off in sound quality. That didn't end up being the case — it was hard to tell the difference listing to the same tracks back-to-back with the Buds Pro 3 and the new Buds 4.</p><p>As it turns out, there may be a hardware reason for that. OnePlus is touting the audio tech inside the Buds 4, which includes an 11mm diaphragm woofer and a 6mm flat diaphragm tweeter. The brand is also using separate dual DACs, one for the woofer and tweeter in each earbud, paired with OnePlus 3D Audio and LHDC 5.0 support.</p><p>Coincidentally, those are the exact same sizes as the woofer and tweeter inside the Buds Pro 3. I don't know whether these are identical parts between the two models, but it does seem to explain why the bass and overall range feels consistent across the pairs of earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hZTTY5joSemsC9cSDmMKDP" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-11" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray in their case, nestled in a tree." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZTTY5joSemsC9cSDmMKDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Put simply, the OnePlus Buds 4 have an outstanding range for earbuds of this price point. Music across genres sounds consistently great, offering just the right emphasis in just the right places. Listening to hip-hop and rap delivers an excellent low-end sound, and one that isn't pervasive. You actually get low-end frequency audio, rather than a bass that overpowers the rest of the soundstage.</p><p>Conversely, the same feels true for other kind of music, like alternative, pop, and jazz. In these genres, the Buds 4 put proper emphasis on instruments like piano and cymbals, as well as the vocals. They sound as balanced as any I've tried lately, right up there with the aforementioned Buds Pro 3. While I might prefer the sound of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, they are certainly more bass-heavy and less balanced than the OnePlus Buds 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a7gsLyHu8SUR9Z6fiCRu5P" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-10" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside their app controls running on a OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7gsLyHu8SUR9Z6fiCRu5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, OnePlus Buds 4 also come with quality active-noise canceling out of the box. The standard ANC mode can block out a ton of noise, especially when playing music at around 50% volume. Niche noise control modes, like transparency and adaptive mode, are usually where most budget or midrange earbuds struggle. Sure enough, adaptive mode wasn't the best — it <em>sometimes</em> let through the voice of someone talking to me, and other times kept blocking it out.</p><p>The solid ANC performance overall shows up on the spec sheet too, as OnePlus claims the Buds 4 can cancel out up to 55 decibels of noise while adjusting up to 800 times per second.</p><p>Aside from sound quality and noise cancelation, it's worth pointing out the OnePlus-specific features available on the Buds 4, which are pretty impressive. Game Mode from the Buds Pro 3 comes to the Buds 4, providing 47ms low-latency connectivity for gaming. You also get an AI Translation mode that aims to help you have a natural conversation with someone who doesn't speak your language.</p><p>The OnePlus Buds 4 are rated for 45 hours of total battery life and 11 hours from just the earbuds, but this is with ANC off. You can expect less than that if you're primarily using ANC modes.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-what-s-not-good"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsthHzS2XvKcwy2FKfhbaP" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-13" alt="A OnePlus Buds 4 earbud on its side, showing the ear tip, vents, and charging contacts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsthHzS2XvKcwy2FKfhbaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 3 Pro review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 3 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review"><strong>OnePlus Buds 2 Pro review</strong></a></p></div></div><p>If the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 and the new Buds 4 are on-par in terms of sound quality and ANC, it's the intangibles that help create separation. While the Buds 4 have an oval-shaped case now, the earbuds themselves are a bit chunky. They're light, weighing 4.7 grams each, but they don't fit in my ears quite as nicely as other options.</p><p>The thicker earbud stems might have something to do with that. The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 have cylindrical stems, whereas the Buds 4 stems are more rectangular with rounded edges. They don't feel as comfortable, and on-earbud controls are much worse. Instead of a quick squeeze or swipe, you're relying on capacitive touch controls on the OnePlus Buds 4, which are frustrating.</p><p>One good thing about the design is the IP55 certification against dust and liquid ingress, so rain or sweat shouldn't be a problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vNqNQp5KVGzWjKMho3XZXN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-14" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray in the palm of my hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNqNQp5KVGzWjKMho3XZXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the general unreliability of the touch controls, there are some other weird quirks here. By default, there's no play/pause control set out of the box — you have to manually enable a single tap for this function in settings.</p><p>Additionally, cycling through ANC modes doesn't provide feedback as to which mode you've switched to. This is a problem now that there are four possible settings: ANC, adaptive, transparency, and off. There's simply too much trial-and-error required to change the right mode or skip to the right song, so I found myself using app controls more often than not.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-competition"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4brcdp8zWdepewdn8GoPLN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-7" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray beside the OnePlus Buds 3 Pro and OnePlus Nord Buds Pro 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4brcdp8zWdepewdn8GoPLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At their full retail price of $129.99, the OnePlus Buds 4 are competing with the aforementioned OnePlus Buds Pro 3. The latter is often on sale for around $150 or less, and it's probably worth paying more for the Buds Pro 3. You get wireless charging, a faux leather case material, better on-earbud controls, and stronger ANC for just $20 more.</p><p>Otherwise, most flagship earbuds are going to be priced a bit higher than the Buds 4. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 cost $150, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> cost $230, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Nothing Ear</a> cost $150. It might be worth grabbing one of those instead if you have the extra cash and a matching phone, but generally, OnePlus earbuds can hang with the best in sound quality.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-4-should-you-buy-them"><span>OnePlus Buds 4: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8URW97VFFLRj5VaH7f5NiN" name="OnePlus-Buds-4-Review-6" alt="The OnePlus Buds 4 in Storm Gray on a ledge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8URW97VFFLRj5VaH7f5NiN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a solid pair of truly-wireless earbuds for around $100</li><li>You have a OnePlus phone and want exclusives like Game Mode and translation</li><li>You need versatile active noise-canceling modes</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want your charging case to support wireless charging</li><li>You need better on-earbud controls</li><li>You can afford to step up to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3</li></ul><p>For anyone in the market for a new pair of affordable wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds 4 are at least worth a look.

Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and the bigger Pro XL are getting their own color lineup: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade.</p><p>As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, you’ll supposedly only get two picks: Moonstone or Jade.</p><p>Here's the breakdown of potential colors and storage options:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Color</p></th><th  ><p>Storage Configurations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Frost</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Indigo</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Lemongrass</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If you’re eyeing the Pixel 10 Pro in Jade finish, you might have to cough up for the 256GB model. The same goes for the Pro XL. And if you're leaning toward the foldable Pro in Jade, don’t expect a 1TB version at all.</p><p>To make things even more layered, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in Porcelain and Moonstone might skip the 1TB option altogether. On the other hand, the Obsidian version could still come in 128GB, hinting at a bit more flexibility for the classic black look.</p><h2 id="black-obsidian-wins-again-2">Black (Obsidian) wins again</h2><p>The Obsidian Pixel 10 Pro XL looks like it's getting the full storage spread: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, all the way up to 1TB. No other color seems to be getting that kind of treatment, making this colorway the most flexible pick if you're picky about storage.</p><p>Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro might still start at 128GB of storage, even though UFS 4.0 usually starts at 256GB. That likely means the base model sticks with the older UFS 3.1 tech, so expect slower speeds compared to the higher-tier versions rocking UFS 4.0.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re talking a drop from 8.0mm on the S24 FE to 7.4mm. It’s a small change, but one that shows Samsung is still dialing in the details to make the device feel more high-end.</p><p>Sticking to Samsung’s 2025 trend of slimming things down, the Galaxy S25 FE is expected to follow suit. The flexible OLED ditching the usual rigid layers (hard substrates) is what’s making that thinner design possible.</p><h2 id="slimmer-than-ever-2">Slimmer than ever</h2><p>The key difference here comes down to the base layer of the display. While rigid OLEDs stick with glass, flexible OLEDs use substrates like plastic or foil. That’s what makes them slimmer.</p><p>Samsung’s usual play for the FE line has been rigid OLEDs. Rumor has it the company went back and forth on whether to keep it that way or switch things up for the S25 FE.</p><p>In the end, it chose flexible, partly to give it a leg up over the cheaper Galaxy A phones. And honestly, with flexible OLEDs popping up more everywhere, the timing just makes sense.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-ai-generated-wallpaper-flower" alt="A Samsung Galaxy 24 FE in the sun with High Brightness Mode enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung Display is said to kick off mass production of flexible OLED panels for the Galaxy S25 FE.

The company just launched a smaller version of its latest watch, the Watch 3 43mm, and a mid-range OnePlus Buds 4.</p><p>To start, the mini Watch 3 is 43 mm in diameter (as its name suggests) and weighs just 37.8g, making it ideal for people who prefer watches with slim dials. The watch sports a 1.32-inch AMOLED display with a default maximum brightness of 600 nits. However, despite its small size, the smartwatch is designed to be powerful.</p><p>"We're bringing a smaller iteration of this device that's perfect for those with smaller wrists – but don't underestimate it," OnePlus's chief marketing officer, Celina Shi, said in an interview earlier this month.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="dBXrdYNXmhcKtka2pSnxig" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBXrdYNXmhcKtka2pSnxig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9504" height="6336" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 43mm is built with a "dual-engine architecture technology" that utilizes two chips, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">standard 46mm OnePlus Watch 3</a>. The watch is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> chipset and the BES2800BP MCU chip, and features a 354mAh battery capacity. According to the company, this battery will last up to seven days in power-saving mode and can be fully charged within an hour. However, it is important to note that for standard use in smart mode, the smartwatch can be used for up to 60 hours.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 43mm is said to be able to track over 100 sports modes and will automatically recognize six types of activities, including running, swimming, rowing, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="EPwtkrTiXueKyZDxuVEpdf" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EPwtkrTiXueKyZDxuVEpdf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8021" height="5350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"We’re also bringing a menstrual cycle tracker as part of the update to our smartwatch, which users will be able to get estimated period, ovulation, and fertile times on their device," OnePlus added.</p><p>However, OnePlus states that the 60-second health check-in won't be available on this variant as it lacks a temperature sensor and vascular health tracking functionality.</p><p>That said, the OnePlus Watch 3 43mm will show up in two colorways: Silver Steel and Black Steel.

The company says that these Buds are designed for all-day wear with a "minimalistic aesthetic." Moreover, each earbud weighs approximately 4.7 grams. Volume controls on the Buds 4 have become even more seamless with intuitive slide gestures right on the stems of these earbuds.</p><p>OnePlus Buds 4 come with  Dual Drivers, Dual DACs, Hi-Res LHDC 5.0, and 3D Audio. These earbuds are specifically made keeping gamers in mind as they offer "47ms ultra-low latency in Game Mode, ensuring audio syncs perfectly with on-screen action for a competitive edge," Shi said.</p><p>This time around, the OnePlus Buds 4 have a unique feature called "Golden Sound," which is a personalized audio tuning system that analyzes the user's ear canal to create an audio profile that adjusts sound playback based on individual hearing preferences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="ZZdL7iCAzrkRDieSvswdfh" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZdL7iCAzrkRDieSvswdfh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9112" height="6075" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, OnePlus states that these new earbuds will adjust noise cancellation based on the user's environment "up to 800 times per second to ensure optimal quiet." These buds can also filter human voices by 200% when compared to the OnePlus Buds 3. This means you can listen to music or binge on TV shows uninterrupted in a crowded space.</p><p>"When walking on the street, the Buds 4 allows users to remain aware of important sounds like traffic or alerts, while still automatically filtering out intrusive noise like low-frequency track rumble when commuting, providing the perfect blend of safety and immersion," OnePlus added in its press release.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9504px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VESz5ZwGWjRXvR8Xr5wdog" name="OnePlus-Watch-Buds-4" alt="OnePlus launches Watch 3 mini and OnePlus Buds 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VESz5ZwGWjRXvR8Xr5wdog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9504" height="6336" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Buds 4 features a 62mAh battery in each earbud, backed by a 530mAh capacity in the charging case.

It has Alexa integration as well, and it connects via HDMI eARC, allowing you to control the volume and your TV with a single remote.

There are countless reasons why you should skip the Pixel 9a or Galaxy S24 FE in favor of this budget buster. With a deal as sweet as this, it would be sheer stupidity to miss out.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> doesn't fail in any category. You want a stunning AMOLED display that oozes brilliance? The 6.78-inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED does exactly that. Perhaps performance is a focal point for you when considering a new phone. Well, hold on to your hat because the 13R's mighty Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 will blow you away with flagship-level performance. Don't even get me started about the battery life and charging specs, because even the S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL will start blushing.</p><p>Any way you look at it, the OnePlus 13R is a fabulous buy at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/"><strong>$499.99 on Amazon</strong></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="121fac69-7019-4048-a631-53c7df55d1b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="A display that serves eye candy, a battery that doesn't know when to quit, and a madly powerful processor make the OnePlus 13R all play and no work.

If you're outside the U.S., then the 55W SUPERVOOC fast charging support is replaced by an even snappier 80W charging speed.</p><p>Powerful performance, lovely display, and hearty battery life. Doesn't that sound beautiful already? To take things up a notch, the phone runs Android 15 out of the box and is guaranteed four major OS upgrades and six years' of security updates. OnePlus makes devices that are meant to last. The 13R has an IP65 water and dust resistance rating. This means you'll be holding on to this awesome mid-ranger for a long time.</p><p>This time around, the OnePlus 13R has a 50MP main and 50MP telephoto lens too. Thanks to the Hasselblad partnership, the results are rather amicable, but they don't match up to flagships like the S25 Ultra or the Pixel 9 Pro. Considering these are phones that cost twice as much, you can be forgiving in this aspect.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Google provides the best AI-backed software suite of any brand today.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need the best battery tech, a PWM-sensitive OLED panel, and fast charging.</p><p>I didn't think I would enjoy using the Pixel 9 Pro XL as much as I did. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">used the device for well over two months</a> when it debuted, and it was terrific; even though it doesn't have the best hardware, Google did a great job optimizing the interface, and the phone handles gaming much better than its predecessors.</p><p>Google somehow managed to deliver the brightest OLED panel of any phone. There are no issues with the 6.8-inch panel, and you get great colors and contrast levels. I like the design too; the new camera bar looks very cool, and it doesn't lead to any wobble when using the phone on a table.</p><p>It's mildly annoying that Google continues to limit the base model to 128GB — most phones get 256GB as standard — so if you need additional storage, you'll need to pay an additional $100. The battery lasts all day, but it doesn't have anywhere close to the same fast charging tech as Chinese rivals.</p><p>That said, the software is one of the biggest reasons to switch to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google did all the right things with its UI, and the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. You also get a great AI suite of utilities, and good customizability. The cameras continue to be great, and while Google doesn't use the best modules, it does wonders around software tuning to deliver standout photos.</p><p>All of this is to say that I really like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I think you should consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">buying it now it's on sale at $749</a>.

It offers fabulous performance, very good software with useful AI features, equally long software update commitment as a Pixel, and a timeless design. Some areas where Samsung should have improved upon would be the battery size, charging speeds, and the cameras, which are still many generations old.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Smaller form factor with slim bezels</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset with 12GB RAM</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>New and improved Galaxy AI features</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>One UI update is fresh, fun, and genuinely great</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Refined design with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on front and back</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Relatively small 4,000mAh battery</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Slow 25W wired charging speeds</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Same camera system as Galaxy S22</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div><p>Google really hit its stride with the Pixel 9 series in 2024. While the new design might not be for everyone, we think it looks fantastic, and we're glad the upcoming Pixel 10 will continue with it. Rumored to launch in mid-August, the Google Pixel 10 is expected to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 but with some big changes that we've all been waiting for. It could very well be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best compact flagship</a> of 2025. Speaking of which, this makes the Galaxy S25 its biggest rival.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung's entry-level flagship model is often neglected, as compromises to battery size and charging speeds deter most buyers. It hasn't had a proper camera upgrade in years, which means newer models have easily raced past it. Deciding between the Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 won't be easy, especially since they'll likely cost roughly the same.</p><p>The Pixel 10 isn't official yet at the time of publication, so we have to rely on leaks and rumors for now. Based on our expectations, the Pixel 10 has the potential to surpass the Galaxy S25 as the compact flagship king. Here's how the features of both phones compare.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is expected to look pretty much identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, and that's alright in our books. We just got a massive design overhaul last year, so no one's surprised about this. The expected dimensions of the Pixel 10 (and, by extension, the 10 Pro) are 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm. Other than being 0.1mm thicker, the rest of the dimensions are the same as those of the 9. Based on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out" target="_blank">early cases we've obtained</a>, the Pixel 10 is expected to have a slightly larger camera bar, which means Pixel 9 cases won't fit the 10.</p><p>This would make the Pixel 10 slightly thicker and with a larger footprint than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. We really hope Google makes the 10 lighter, as the Pixel 9 was nearly 200g, which was way heavier than the 162g Galaxy S25. We should also expect some new colors for the 10, along with an IP68 dust and water resistance. We could hope for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a>, which would put it above the S25. Build quality will be top-notch thanks to an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (or better) for the front and back.</p><p>Displays on Pixels have long been a weak link. While the Pixel 9 increased the peak brightness of the panels to 2,700 nits, it still employs a 240Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">PWM dimming</a> frequency, which is problematic if your eyes are sensitive to flicker. We should hopefully see this fixed on the Pixel 10, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> in April 2025 that they "are aware and investigating this."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-galaxy-s25-is-boring-but-a-dbrand-skin-fixes-that">Samsung Galaxy S25 won't wow you with its look</a>, much like an iPhone, but it's something that's been refined over the past several generations. It, too, comes in multiple pastel shades, including some exclusive colors, if you buy it directly via Samsung's online store. It boasts similar levels of build quality, featuring an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass on both the front and back. It's IP68 rated for weather resistance, and it's more compact and lighter than the Pixel 10.</p><p>The display on the Galaxy S25 measures 6.2 inches with a Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz LTPO AMOLED panel, and a high brightness of up to 2,600 nits. The display is crisp and easily legible outdoors on a sunny day, and it has a much higher PWM dimming rate of 480Hz compared to the Pixel.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AsbNJBPaY3XYKkQhE6bug4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 is not expected to receive any price increase, which means it should continue to cost $799 for 128GB of storage and $899 for 256GB. This would make it slightly pricier than the Galaxy S25. The big change that we're all excited to see is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip, which will be its first smartphone SoC designed completely in-house and manufactured by TSMC.</p><p>All previous Tensor chips were based on Samsung's Exynos chip designs, which weren't really helping in any way. With a new design and fabrication partner, The G5 should hopefully be able to go head-to-head or even beat the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip.</p><p>Besides getting a bump in raw performance, we should hopefully see a larger battery, too, with quicker charging. The second major change rumored is the inclusion of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">telephoto camera on the base Pixel 10</a>. This has usually been reserved for just the Pro models in the past, but with this addition, the Pixel 10 would be more Pro than ever.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 2424x1080, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 2700 nits max</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 480Hz PWM, HDR10+, 2600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 10MP telephoto + 12MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68/IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Wi-Fi 6 (India), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,970mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 typically sells for a lower price today, even without any major sales, making it a better value. Even the top-end 256GB variant now costs around $779.99 on Samsung's website, which is significantly lower than what the Pixel 10's equivalent is expected to cost.</p><p>One of the best features of the Galaxy S25 is its solid and dependable performance, considering the compact and lightweight design. Gaming performance is very good; it doesn't heat up as much, and the display is easy on the eyes in low light. All the cameras are great, too, but it's nothing spectacular since the sensors have been recycled from older models once again.</p><p>The same applies to the battery life, which is acceptable for the phone's size, but it could have been improved. You should still get a full day's worth of use on one charge but don't expect much more. Charging is still stuck at 25W, which is somewhat disappointing for a phone at this price.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-software-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8nqK6fPrM96zAcwqTTxE8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Pixel 9, which didn't launch with the latest version of Android at the time, the Pixel 10 will most likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> this time since the stable version is already available for the Pixel 9 series.

We feel Google's AI features are more useful, the Pixel 10's design is bolder, and you'll always be ahead of Samsung when it comes to getting the latest Android flavor and features. It's going to be more expensive at launch for sure, but with trade-in offers and other pre-order discounts, you should be able to offset some of the premium.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 is a solid phone, no doubt, and it's a great value buy if you can find it at a discount during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon's Prime Day sale</a>. Our primary concern with buying a Samsung flagship around this time is that there is an expiry date on the free use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which is expected at the end of 2025. This means Samsung will likely offer certain (read: most commonly used) Galaxy AI features as part of a subscription package, which would incur an additional monthly or yearly expense.</p><p>Google doesn't really do this (not yet anyway), which means nearly all AI features on the Pixel 10 would be free to use indefinitely. That is, unless you want to use more advanced AI models, which require a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a6aadc3f-c91d-48cb-aa90-658ca0dfba05">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pocket rocket</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 is a dependable flagship from Samsung, that's now selling for a better price than when it launched.

The latest buzz claims the Ultra model might be getting an upgrade to its 3x zoom camera.</p><p>New details from Ice Universe on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PzEo0uobY" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-design-upgrade-leak-3574334/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) give us a clearer look at what Samsung is cooking up for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera gear.</p><p>As per the rumor, Samsung is sticking with the tried-and-true for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This means we can expect the same 200MP main camera and 50MP 5x zoom lens, just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s26-ultra/" target="_blank">previous rumors said</a>.</p><p>However, Ice Universe says the 3x telephoto camera is getting a noticeable upgrade to 12MP. For context, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra rocks a 10MP lens for its 3x zoom. If the latest leak checks out, it will be a small but meaningful upgrade, especially for fans of crisp portraits and zoom shots.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely keeping its usual 5,000mAh battery, but charging might finally get the upgrade fans have been waiting for. While Samsung has been stuck at 45W for years, word is the S26 Ultra could crank it up to something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">brings it more in line with the fast-charging heavyweights</a> out there.</p><h2 id="slimmer-but-still-stacked-2">Slimmer but still stacked</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-camera-islands-03" alt="Looking at the raised camera lenses on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJJVz5vaBEyU9R8cjLBWd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One standout potential change is in the body itself. Ice Universe claims the S26 Ultra is slimming down, landing somewhere in the 7.xmm range. That’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-trying-to-make-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-with-new-camera-lenses">noticeably thinner than the S25 Ultra’s 8.2mm frame</a>.</p><p>Packing the same 5,000mAh battery into a much slimmer frame isn’t exactly an easy feat, and if Samsung pulls it off, it’s a pretty big win for design and hardware engineering. Still, for power users chasing all-day juice, a bigger battery would’ve been the real dream.</p><p>In a separate report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-key-specs-upgrades-leak.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra is getting a front camera upgrade. The exact specs are still under wraps for now, but something better definitely seems to be in the pipeline.</p><p>On top of that, the outlet says the 200MP main camera is expected to get a new and likely improved lens, plus a fresh laser autofocus sensor designed to lock focus faster and more reliably.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Hardware that screams, “We’ve paid attention to detail, fit, and finish.” It is in that beauty that the functionality is often hidden, delivering explosive results.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins' latest Px7 S3 over-ear headphones could have been named the “007.”. Everything about them feels premium, like Bond’s Aston Martin Vanquish. They wear like one of his bespoke suits, comfortable over long hours, while looking every bit the part.</p><p>The Px7 also boast versatile functionality, like a watch or pen that Bond’s weapons/gadgets guy, Q, would give you. Most importantly, sonically, they’re as engrossing and smooth as Adele’s delivery of the “Skyfall” theme song.</p><p>As they say, “the Bond despot is in the details,” so let’s break down what makes Bowers & Wilkins' latest generation of the <del>007</del> Px7 series a welcome and worthy addition to your options for best-in-class noise-canceling over-ear headphones.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-price-and-availability"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-in-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 shown with case open and accessories lid closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LNiAQFbguKvZoJNJfu4RTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 was launched in April 2025 outside the US and Latin America. On May 10th, 2025, Bowers & Wilkins announced U.S. availability, beginning with pre-orders. It's widely available now for $449 in Anthracite Black, Indigo Blue, and Canvas White.</p><p>Note that the previous model took five months post-launch to see a $50 price drop on Amazon.

Most recently, one of my favorite headphone cases was for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/noble-fokus-apollo-review" target="_blank">Noble Focus Apollo</a>, partially because I like how they created the pocket to stow cables. I’m no fan of those mesh pockets in the lids of some products.</p><p>The Px7 S3 improves on that by offering a smaller case with cable storage featuring a magnetic lid that keeps things looking nice and tidy inside. My only complaint is the lack of a lanyard attachment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-accessories.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 in their case, with the accessory storage flap open and included cables showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ya4345UcWi9W52Kzn42dWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opening the case and getting to the goods inside, you’re greeted by two USB-C cables. One terminates in a 3.5mm male plug for analog audio, and the other is USB-C for 24/96kHz high-resolution digital audio. For the first time, the Px7 S3 features a built-in headphone amplifier/DAC that powers the connectivity. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins sent me the Indigo Blue pair for this review, and they are gorgeous! From the metal backs of the cans and the hinges to the textured, woven fabrics on the cans and the headband to the vegan leather earcups wrapped around delightfully soft memory foam, the Px7 S3 is very well-appointed.</p><p>Thankfully, Bowers & Wilkins put as much effort into building mechanics and ergonomics. On the head for hours, the clamping force shouldn’t give you headaches. The hinges slide in and out of the headband with reassuring friction and swivel to fit your ears without feeling wobbly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-power-button.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with power and Quick Mode buttons shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xMwrp7ydon8PZxKaSn4bYh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Power and Quick Mode buttons. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-playback-controls.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2Yw4Y3AAtwAFpPxvty7Uh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with playback controls. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-case-beauty-shot.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVSbnq7icC4BHa5qhxzm5i.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 closed case. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-magnetic-lid-accessories-inside.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psxwhJvjaSQc5HCT7Jt5wi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with bundled cables. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-empty-case.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories shown closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SAUbotLaUSfgzdayBZSqi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 with case magnetic lid for accessories. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One aspect of the build quality that I love here is the power button. With many competitors, you have to press and hold the power button for a moment, guessing whether it has been activated properly. The Px7 S3’s slide switch never leaves any doubt about whether you’ve switched the headphones on or off or placed them into pairing mode.</p><p>I have the Quick Mode button set to cycle through ANC modes, but you can also set it to invoke your voice assistant. That’s on the left can.</p><p>The right can is where you’ll find the volume buttons, with the play/pause button between them, and they all have excellent tactility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-AP80-DAC-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to the Hidisz AP80 PRO-X DAP via the included USB-C to 3.5mm cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnyVAMQSBW6VUHtASf5d7i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the luminescence of a diverse array of musical genres, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 were beautiful every time. My cup of tea, for sure!</p><p>The Px7 S3 aren't tuned for reference audio, but instead provide a highly engaging and entertaining listening platform, with the DAC/amps powering robust audio, matched to the angled 40mm biocellulose drivers. Those components have been completely redesigned, with all but one element being new to the Px7 S3—a near redesign from its predecessor, the Px7 S2e.</p><p>I listened to audio in Bluetooth mode, utilizing high-resolution aptX with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>. I also tested sound quality via wired connections to the same phone as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/review-questyle-m18i" target="_blank">excellent Questyle M18i DAC</a> and Hidizs’ AP80 PRO-X DAP (pictured above). Most surprisingly, the sound quality directly from the phone was as good as it was being pumped through the M18i. That speaks volumes about the quality of the DSP and amp/DAC in the Px7 S3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-on-head" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2b8m77NGRJef4HtSbRTeeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of the files I listened to were either high-resolution Tidal streams or local DSF and FLAC files. One of my favorite DSF tracks for testing nuance in the mids is Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” and Bowers & Wilkins does not disappoint! A few seconds into the song's intro, Jackson’s backing vocals come into the mix, and lesser headphones don’t isolate them well enough to help them stand out from the whole mix as the Px7 S3 does.</p><p>Listening to that track also gave me a glimpse into the weight of the bass representation on offer here. It’s weighty without dropping slop all over the other frequencies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-Google-Pixel9-connected.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 connected to a Google Pixel 9 via the included USB-C to USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3br3zdrC72BWvStoUZmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dubstep, Hip-Hop, Jazz tracks, and anything with deep bass or driving basslines were thoroughly engaging and immersive. Much like the Hulk but with David Banner’s psyche at the helm of the green monster, the lows have the ability to smash, but under the Px7 S3’s authority, they are a model for power under control.</p><p>Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and The Roots’ “Do You Want More?!?!!” both have deeply resonant sub-bass, which is produced with delicious depth in these cans without muddying the mids and highs in those tracks. Booming 808s and dark sub-bass are both tightly controlled, with no bleed. This is evident as you listen to the bagpipes in the mix on the Roots’ track.</p><p>Overall, the treble is smooth, not analytical, which makes listening to Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” more pleasurable. There are some shrill horns in that mix, which can get a bit fatiguing when I listen via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser’s god-tier IE900 IEMs</a>. This also makes listening to some metal tracks a smoother experience as you get into wailing electric guitar riffs.</p><p>System of a Down’s meticulously mastered albums are a joy to listen to with the Px7 S3. You truly get the texture and grit, the detail in Daron Malakian's fingering frets, with strong vocal representation as lead singer Serj Tankian, goes from softer singing to more guttural speed metal-style vocal delivery.</p><p>With the treble being on the smoother side, you get a more intimate soundstage that isn’t as airy or as deep as others. It’s still there, and it’s solid, and some may prefer it over larger presentations.</p><p>When it comes to nuance, Bowers & Wilkins' in-house developed digital signal processing does a fantastic job of maintaining the sound's robustness at lower listening levels, just as it does when the volume is cranked.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-1" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnprVjdUi8Tdors4aSQQgL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-settings" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyLunnoGUr4FMNBDxhPneL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-home-2" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app home, showing ANC options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEtmnDcnZHh2ys3HAPJviL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL" name="bowers-wilkins-Px7-S3-app-EQ" alt="Bowers & Wilkins app five-band EQ customization and True Sound option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzZiwFWRFDiKv2sJYDeFeL.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>By the way, does anyone call anyone anymore? I'm not sure, but folks definitely do Zoom and other video chats, so it's good to know that the microphones on the Px7 S3s do a great job of ensuring your voice is clear while eliminating a good amount of background noise.</p><p>Bowers & Wilkins claims you'll get 30 hours out of these cans with ANC on, and so far, I've been on track to match that. Of course, you can control ANC directly on the headphones, but the app also allows you to do that, and this year, you even get expanded sound customization in the form of a five-band EQ, up from three in the previous generation.</p><p>The app is fairly basic, but that's okay because you can do a lot with the headphones themselves, so you don't actually need much in the app. The default sound is so good that I didn't find additional tuning necessary and was just fine with what Bowers & Wilkins labels "True Sound," which is touted as tuning that allows you to listen to recordings just as the artists intended.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bowers-wilkins-px7-s3-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3: What could use improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-headphones-propped-up.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 propped up on a deck, showing the branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LQ849a7z8n3aEU6YKFFDNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-post-malone-noise-cancelling-headphones-launch"><strong>Sony, Post Malone partner for the WH-1000XM6 headphones that wrap you in music</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio codecs explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ</strong></a></p></div></div><p>ANC does a solid job when it comes to low-frequency sounds, but you will have some high-frequency bleed. Noise from cars, cafe silverware clanking, and even voices in the upper register, but that’s with the sound off. With your music playing, much of that ambient noise won’t be noticeable, thanks to auditory masking.</p><p>Officially, there is currently no support for spatial audio, which, in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE</a>, will be added later this year. However, there is a “spatial audio” toggle in the Bluetooth settings on my Google Pixel 9. Why mention this? There is some barely noticeable latency when watching videos, and deactivating this toggle helps alleviate the issue.</p><p>I also noticed that some films lose a bit of mid-frequency impact when it’s activated, which is apparent in “Thor: Ragnarok” because Thor’s hammer loses some of its punch. Deactivating HD Audio also helps with latency, which I don’t think most viewers would notice anyway. I have decades of experience in film and TV editing, so I’m prone to noticing <em>extremely</em> subtle sync issues between picture and sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh" name="bowers-and-wilkins-Px7-S3-earcups.JPG" alt="Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 showing the insides of the earcups" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Nk6r3zWB3qhfJQnNNAUqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the headphones don’t launch with Bluetooth LE, that also includes support for Auracast.

Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that drives the rest of the S25 lineup, plus you get a massive 200MP camera and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. And like many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, the Edge comes with seven years of guaranteed software support straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, all of that shed weight has to come from somewhere, and it's true that the Galaxy S25 Edge only has a meager 3,900mAh battery. This means that the device won't last as long as some 2025 phones, so you'll have to decide if the thin frame is worth the hit. That said, for folks who love sleek and sophisticated devices, like yours truly, buying the Galaxy S25 Edge is a no-brainer. Sure, Prime Day 2025 (July 8-11) is sure to come with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Galaxy deals</a> in tow, but if you're looking for a change in your wireless setup, why not see if T-Mobile can hook you up with something free and fancy today? </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The data represented how well smartwatches did in shipments on a global/international scale. According to the post, watch shipments in Q1 slipped by 2% YoY (year-over-year); however, Samsung saw the biggest overall drop "across all major markets."</p><p>The research highlights the Korean OEM's previous-gen smartwatches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra</a>. Samsung reportedly saw a major 18% YoY decline, which topped Apple's 9% drop in shipments.</p><p>While Samsung and Apple are on opposite sides of this totem pole, Counterpoint highlights Chinese makers like Huawei and Xiaomi, which saw happier first quarters. Research states both Chinese OEMs saw a 53% jump in Q1 shipments YoY. Moreover, China, as a whole, saw a 37% boost in watch shipments, followed by LATAM with 24%.</p><p>The smartwatch market is speculated to improve later in 2025, per Counterpoint's senior research analyst, Anshika Jain. This could occur at a "modest pace," with a projected growth of roughly 3%. Jain adds that what may bring people back are the innovations and improvements in smartwatches, most notably thanks to "AI features and next-generation health sensors."</p><h2 id="samsung-looks-to-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">Samsung looks to the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung might have to look toward its Galaxy Watch 8 models to breathe some sort of life into its wearable performance.

Depending on the websites you need to visit and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans" target="_blank">quality of your service connection</a>, you may experience problems from time to time. Factors such as how the website is served to you or the quality of your wireless service in a particular location are largely beyond your control, so let's start with what you <em>can</em> control.</p><p>In the settings of your phone, there are several things you should review. Unfortunately, every phone is slightly different, and even different carriers can have different settings; however, what we're looking for is relatively simple to find.</p><p>There is a setting that allows you to use your data connection when you're not on Wi-Fi. If pages load sometimes, this is probably enabled, but you should check. On my unlocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, there's a slider that's labeled <strong>Use Mobile Data</strong>,<strong> </strong>so yours should say something similar. Make sure it's turned on.</p><p>Phones and carriers often have a way to limit bandwidth. This can be handy while you're roaming or if you're on a limited data plan, but it can also choke a connection if the website is a little heavy on resources. You're looking for a setting to <strong>allow 5G data</strong> and one to <strong>allow data use while roaming</strong>. For now, make sure both of these are on. <em>Remember where you found them in case you want to turn them off again in the future.</em></p><h2 id="have-you-hit-the-data-cap-2">Have you hit the data cap?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="itBoncmWXRJCvnC3oZUbrN" name="mint data usage.jpg" alt="mint mobile app showing data usage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itBoncmWXRJCvnC3oZUbrN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every wireless plan has a cap when the data connection is either cut off or slowed to a crawl. You may be paying for an "unlimited" data plan, but trust me, your carrier will slow you down if it thinks it needs to, based on how much you're using and where you are.</p><p>Most of the time, they use words like high-speed data to differentiate. Let's say you pay for 10GB of data each month. You should expect to be able to use your service as fast as it can be for those 10GB. Once you've used it up, most carriers will still let things work, just at a very slow rate.</p><p>This slow data rate is enough to allow an iPhone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> to still work normally; both need to connect to Apple or Google every once in a while but use very little bandwidth for these check-ins. The rest of the internet can seem kind of broken, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qbVwmpz6MQWLU4MW97xABc" name="5g-phone-sim-cards.jpg" alt="Galaxy S20+ 5G network with SIM cards" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbVwmpz6MQWLU4MW97xABc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If your carrier is throttling your data, pages can take forever to load or shoot you an error message when they get tired of waiting. As typical data speeds increase, this problem worsens — web designers build a page so it looks great under ideal circumstances, but often overlook what happens when things aren't ideal.</p><p>You can check to see how much data you've used in the mobile data settings of your phone, or you can just call your carrier and ask. You may even have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-verizon-demo-app-vulnerability-details" target="_blank">app from your carrier</a> that displays this number. If you've used your monthly allotment of high-speed data or use a lot of data in general, you might be getting throttled.</p><p>You will need to contact your carrier about this. If they are limiting the bandwidth available to you, there's nothing you can do to change it. They'll probably try to upsell you a higher-tier plan, so be prepared for a sales pitch.</p><h2 id="location-matters-more-than-you-think-2">Location matters more than you think</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.17%;"><img id="G4QgBkpsAoXBsPv7vkWu2Q" name="verizon coverage map september 2024.jpg" alt="verizon coverage map as of september 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4QgBkpsAoXBsPv7vkWu2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1223" height="687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you zoom in close on any carrier's coverage map, you'll soon see that they are full of holes. Sometimes, they'll have limited service in certain areas; at other times, you'll be roaming via "partner data"; and sometimes, there is simply no service available.</p><p>As you can imagine, this is a bigger problem in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">rural areas</a> than in bigger cities. I live in one of these problem areas, and once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-sprint-faq">Sprint went away</a>, my wireless service got much worse. Yes, Sprint coverage here was excellent, and that's something you won't hear very often.</p><p>I can get in the car and drive just a few miles and see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">5G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/poll-smartwatch-lte-connectivity">LTE</a>, roaming coverage, and no service from my phone. There's nothing wrong with the phone; it's just a weak connection, lots of forest, and big stone mountains affecting the signal.</p><p>There is nothing I can do to fix this. There isn't a lot the carriers can do to fix it. either. It would be impossible to filter out every dead zone by placing a tower or repeater to blanket the area in coverage, and if it were possible, someone would have to pay for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you notice problems in a particular location, it's possible that you're experiencing the same issue. In the United States and Canada, there are numerous areas with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/americas-rural-broadband-landscape-will-never-be-good-enough" target="_blank">inadequate cell coverage</a> due to the vast size and distance between population centers. Verizon or AT&T don't want to spend billions to provide excellent service where nobody lives, so they focus on cities and suburbia first.</p><p>Unfortunately, the only solution if this is your problem would be to check if another carrier performs better. Sometimes, you can get lucky, but chances are, if one carrier doesn't offer robust service in a location, neither will any of the others.</p><p>If I were to put on a blindfold and just guess at what the problem might be, I would say you're either being throttled by your carrier or live where the connection isn't the greatest. But be sure to check your settings and be mindful of where things work well and where they don't. It could make all the difference.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For $350 less, you get a twice-as-bright display, a half-ounce lighter design, the same new perks like Bluetooth calling, ECGs, and a flashlight — pretty much everything except the dive-proof metal case, extra battery, and premium golf tools.</p><p>For everyone else, the Forerunner 970 will look overpriced; its pro fitness tools are available at lower tiers, and its smarts and apps are limited compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review" target="_blank">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>Should runners downgrade to the Forerunner 570, give the 970 a try, or skip them both for an older Garmin that's discounted for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a>?</p><p>Having spent over a month taking the Garmin Forerunner 970 on dozens of runs, I can wholeheartedly recommend it!

The mic quality is quiet but clear, catching your voice with a normal walking motion but sounding best held up to your mouth; the speaker at max volume also picks up the other caller coherently in windy outdoor conditions.</p><p>The processor is optimized to handle all on-watch tasks fairly quickly, though slower than a smartwatch with proper RAM. But it notably struggles with offline maps. Zoom in or out, pan to a new area, search for nearby landmarks or generate a round-trip route on the watch, and it's a painfully slow wait.

It'll last 15 days with normal settings but fall closer to 10 days if you do regular GPS-tracked runs and walks, enable nightly SpO2 readings, or use maps or on-wrist calling frequently.</p><p>An hour of SatIQ-mode GPS uses up about 4–5% of the battery, but that's fairly standard for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.

The crux is that the Forerunner 970 is as accurate as a $750 watch should be.</p><p>For heart rate, the Elevate v5 sensor is Garmin's most accurate option, and it shows. It does very well for normal runs, only inflating my HR by about 1 bpm at times. For anaerobic track workouts, it remains within 1–2 bpm of my Polar H10 chest strap, rapidly recognizing changes in effort; many competing brands will be 5–10 bpm off for the same activity type.</p><p>GPS tracking is fantastic, particularly the dual-band GPS mode, which allows you to trace your path exactly on a satellite map. The SatIQ mode also works well and saves a few hours of battery, but can struggle more with obstacles like underpasses.</p><p>Its step counting was absurdly accurate, measuring 5,000 and 5,001 steps after I manually counted 5,000 steps twice.

Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">intentionally changing your running form doesn't work</a>, these metrics only provide context, not anything actionable for training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Schedule a race in your Garmin Calendar, and the <strong>projected race time predictor</strong> shows how fast Garmin's algorithm thinks you could run it in X weeks if you stick to its training plan.

A person close to the matter informed the publication that "getting all of TikTok’s users in the U.S. to move over to a new app, bringing their profiles with them, could pose technical issues in practice." There are roughly over 170 million users on TikTok in the U.S., just for perspective.</p><p>While this may seem strange, sources suggest this could be a maneuver to help satiate the U.S. government's "data security" concerns. If you remember, this was a major catalyst behind the government's stern look at TikTok's (ByteDance) handling of data in China.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Trump Administration reportedly informed the press late last week (July 4) that the government is "getting close" to sealing the deal on a TikTok purchase for its U.S. operations. However, a challenge remains: getting China to O.K. the deal.</p><p>ByteDance is supposedly working to get this new "TikTok for U.S." app out on September 5, before its next ban deadline, which is September 17. The report states the new version will be available on U.S. app stores, and there's speculation that TikTok would begin informing its U.S.-based users about the switch ahead of time to prepare. The publication adds that the old (original) version will remain active until March 2026.</p><h2 id="finding-a-way-2">Finding a way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.00%;"><img id="XhbqpFWGc7kXhLoux7Ew6B" name="tiktok-logo.png" alt="TikTok logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhbqpFWGc7kXhLoux7Ew6B.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1250" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TikTok)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been on this TikTok ban train for a while, and last year was no different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-ban-just-got-the-houses-nod-and-it-might-be-law-real-soon">as the House passed a bill</a> that offered two routes: sell to a U.S. company or face a ban. While TikTok's part was included in the country's larger bill focusing on foreign sanctions, the root of the problem is the nation's worry about how the app is using user data. In 2024, legislators expressed concern over the app's ties to China and that the app could "push propaganda to the US crowd."</p><p>Moreover, the "heaps" of data TikTok is cataloguing were also a concern.</p><p>ByteDance has remained against the idea of completely selling off TikTok in the U.S., stating it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">rather ditch the country entirely</a>. Fast-forward to today, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/trump-tiktok-ban-1236435564/">Trump has extended TikTok's stay</a> in the U.S. until September 17, as the country seeks divestiture. This comes after the administration's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">previous 75-day extension</a>, which began back in April. It seemed evident earlier this year that ByteDance was working with the government to hash out a way forward that both sides could be happy with.</p><p>Still, nothing was set in stone, and there were "key matters" that needed to be resolved. Perhaps this alleged TikTok U.S. version could solve those problems. If the reports are true, we might only have a couple of months to wait and see.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This device is meant to be a tri-fold phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>; however, TECNO says its version will be the "thinnest of its kind." A major highlight of the Ultimate G Fold is TECNO's decision to go with an inward-folding design.</p><p>The post says its inner displays fold inward "twice," to "shield the screens when not in use." TECNO remains confident that this inward-folding method will keep your displays protected from "scratches and impacts."</p><p>Internally, the Ultimate G Fold concept features a dual-hinge, as expected. TECNO states users can unfold the phone and lay it completely flat. Moreover, despite rocking the internal mechanisms designed for a phone with three screens, the post adds that the Ultimate G Fold is as thin as a dual-screen (book-style) phone. We'll have to see just how thin TECNO can go, and if it comes anywhere near <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor's Magic V5</a>.</p><p>TECNO teases the G Fold's "smooth, multi-angle hovering" capabilities for hands-free uses, which mirrors a laptop and gives users another way to enjoy content. The company plans to fully unveil its Ultimate G Fold concept in mid-July, but we might've gotten an early (alleged) look.</p><h2 id="still-just-a-concept-2">Still just a concept</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:803px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.72%;"><img id="8g8PWFDaLgYCfp2i2mZTkA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak" alt="A rumored real life photo of a person holding TECNO's Ultimate G Fold in its folded state." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8g8PWFDaLgYCfp2i2mZTkA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="803" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:803px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.72%;"><img id="PAuA8VmYpqx5xcNnmXBsjA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak-unfolding" alt="An alleged real life photo of a person unfolding TECNO's Ultimate G Fold concept foldable phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAuA8VmYpqx5xcNnmXBsjA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="803" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:447px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.23%;"><img id="jXQcHh4wwLWpjEj3Kq3WfA" name="tecno-ultimate-g-fold-2025-concept-hands-on-leak-standing" alt="An alleged real life photo of the TECNO Ultimate G Fold concept foldable opened and standing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXQcHh4wwLWpjEj3Kq3WfA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="447" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Early this morning (July 7), prominent tipster Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1942186104561750466">posted a few snapshots</a> of the alleged Ultimate G Fold concept from TECNO on X. In one image, the person holding the supposed phone shows just how TECNO plans for its inward-folding method to work. The two screens that fold appear quite tightly pressed against one another, and the center display, when closed.</p><p>When unfolded, the phone appears quite thin, but it's difficult to ascertain just how thin just from photos.</p><p>Additionally, it seems TECNO is preparing a horizontal triple camera array on the back of the Ultimate G Fold. This is a notable difference from the company's other concept shown off in 2024.</p><p>Speaking of 2024, TECNO gave us a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">solid look at its tri-fold concept</a>, which was previously called the Phantom Ultimate 2. A clear difference between what's been alleged on social media and the 2024 concept art is its camera array. TECNO started with a vertical triple array, but has seemingly switched to a horizontal look. It's also worth mentioning that TECNO states its tri-fold can achieve an 11mm measurement when folded.</p><p>At the time, that was slightly slimmer than Samsung's Z Fold 6 (12.1mm). We'll have to see how far TECNO has come with its folded and unfolded measurements.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

AI and machine learning were around well before then, but ChatGPT's emergence marked a turning point. Soon after, AI would become everywhere — on our phones, in our favorite apps, and part of our most-used services.</p><p>Whenever something new pops up, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, it takes a while for researchers to learn its true effects on our minds and daily lives. That process is only beginning, but an early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1" target="_blank">study</a> from MIT's Media Lab highlights some concerning trends regarding AI usage. It hasn't been peer-reviewed yet and has a small scope, including 54 participants aged 18 to 39 years old from the Boston region.</p><p>The results found that people regularly using ChatGPT to write essays had the lowest brain engagement of the groups studied and "consistently underperformed" at all levels compared to the other groups, which used either Google Search or only their own brains to write essays. The study demonstrates "the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills" resulting from LLM use, per the report.</p><p>If you use AI tools, that probably sounds scary. You might be wondering whether using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">generative AI and large language models (LLMs)</a> regularly puts your critical thinking skills at risk. While there's reason for concern, using AI for the right things probably won't be as dangerous to your mind as you might think.</p><h2 id="what-the-mit-study-found-2">What the MIT study found</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it's important to understand the scope of the study and what its results actually mean. The team of researchers at MIT wanted to figure out how using AI to write an essay affected participants' learning and brain function. The study contained three groups: a brain-only group, an LLM group, and a search engine group.</p><p>The participants were asked to write three essays, one per session while remaining in their group. Those who were in the brain-only group could not use any external tools to write their essays in any of the sessions, for example. Then, in the fourth and final session, LLM users were asked to use only their brains to write an essay, and brain-only users were permitted to use LLMs — 18 participants took part in this final test.</p><p>All the while, researchers measured brain activity across 32 regions using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a device that records electrical signals firing in the brain. The tests aimed to record not only how cognitive function behaved during essay writing while using brain-only, LLMs, or search engines but also how it changed following prolonged LLM usage.</p><p>Aside from measuring brain activity with EEGs, the researchers conducted interviews with participants after each session. They also used human teachers to score essays while having an "AI judge" evaluate the works.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P" name="chatgpt-kotor-ii-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="ChatGPT Live Conversation transcript about KOTOR II on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The results painted a clear picture: brain activity and engagement decreased with the amount of external tools needed. The study found that the brain-only group had the strongest level of brain connectivity, with the search engine group displaying intermediate levels and the LLM group performing the weakest.</p><p>When the LLM users were asked to use only their brains to write the final essay, the participants "showed weaker neural connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks." In contrast, brain-only groups who were then permitted to use an LLM for the final essay "demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and prefrontal nodes."</p><p>In layman's terms, those who used an LLM to write the essays produced lower-quality work, couldn't recall what they had submitted, and had lower brain engagement. Additionally, those who had relied on LLMs before being asked to only use their brains performed worse than the brain-only group.</p><p>"The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group's participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring," the study found.</p><h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-you-an-ai-user-2">What does this mean for you, an AI user?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPJdJmhzrozDPLkfEdtkBA" name="how-to-use-chatgpt-on-chromebook-16x9.jpg" alt="Bing ChatGPT on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPJdJmhzrozDPLkfEdtkBA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The study's results are yet to be peer-reviewed, but let's face it, they aren't exactly surprising. Like any other muscle, your brain needs to be used regularly to stay in shape. If you stop using your brain to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-custom-ai-gems-workspace-apps-side-panel-rollout">write essays, reports, emails, or text messages often</a>, those skills will start to deteriorate.</p><p>People who often vouch for AI in learning and work environments often compare chatbots and LLMs to a calculator. When the calculator first became prolific, teachers wanted it banned. Now, calculators are allowed to be used in educational settings and are a vital part of our everyday lives — they're on our phones, computers, and even smartwatches.</p><p>I do think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-of-googles-best-generative-ai-features-is-rolling-out-on-older-pixel-phones-for-free">generative AI</a> is like a calculator, but maybe not in the way its advocates think. As a writer, I haven't used complex math regularly since my early college days, when I was getting my required math courses out of the way. Since then, a calculator has been my best friend, and guess what? I'm not as good at mental math as I was before.</p><p>Similarly, I haven't regularly handwritten words in years — I'm an all-digital person now and have been for some time. When I get handed a form at the doctor's office, my penmanship isn't nearly as good as it once was, and I get hand cramps pretty quickly. All that is to say, the MIT study's findings are really just reinforcing common sense. If you create a dependency on artificial intelligence and stop using a particular skill, you will absolutely lose it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM" name="pixel-studio-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, that's not as scary as it might sound. It all depends on <em>how</em> you incorporate AI into your daily life. Want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">generative AI to make a wallpaper</a> or a cool image to share with your friends? Want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini to replace Google Assistant</a> as your voice-based helper on an Android phone? Need it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">analyze long documents</a>? I don't think any of these use cases present a significant risk of harming your cognitive abilities.</p><p>When you use AI to do something you <em>can</em> do yourself, you're at risk of losing those skills. If you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> to write all your emails, documents, and reports, there is a good chance your skills will start to fade away — that's essentially what the MIT study found.</p><p>But that's not how I use artificial intelligence, and I don't think that's how most people use it, either. I use AI to do things I couldn't possibly do, and that's why it's helpful. That includes analyzing and summarizing documents that are thousands of pages long or generating an image that I couldn't create because I'm no artist. In those instances, AI is expanding your capabilities, not replacing them.</p><p>If you look at AI as a way to elevate your possibilities rather than replace the things you'd rather not do, you probably don't need to change your AI usage habits. However, if you want to use AI to eliminate certain parts of your workflow, think about whether you're willing to lose those skills in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When UGREEN said that it was also making a USB-C cable with a built-in display, I was excited.</p><p>The Uno 100W USB-C to USB-C cable ticks all the right boxes; it has a nylon-braided design that makes it durable, aluminum shells on either end, and an E-marker chip — a must-have in all cables that go up to 100W. The best part?

The display defaults to an emoji, and it's similar to what you get with the rest of the Uno line, with UGREEN doing a great job building out a playful theme. While you don't get useful details like how fast a connected device is charging, the included animations are adorable, and if anything, they add to the Uno's distinctiveness.</p><p>Now, UGREEN could have easily slotted in a power meter into the cable, and it would have been similar to dozens of other options you can get today. But it didn't do that, and I like the frivolity of bundling an LED panel just to showcase emoji. The cable itself is pretty great, and it doesn't cost much more than an equivalent rival — the 1.6ft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0D7BL2JBN">option is $9</a>, there's a 6.6ft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0D7B719XQ?th=1">cable that's $13</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B0DLBFXVBG">10ft model is $16</a>.</p><p>The Uno cable holds up just as well with data, going up to 480Mbps. I didn't have any issues using it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Vivo X200 Pro, OnePlus 13, and the Honor Magic 7 Pro, but I will admit that I routinely got distracted by the emoji — it is quite adorable. <br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is here: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You get the same LCD panel that shows remaining battery level and real-time charging details, and it is quite handy to have.</p><p>The biggest difference is that there's now a retractable cable built into the chassis. The cable sits at the top and is hidden when not in use — it has a magnetic in the USB-C connector that allows it to stay attached to the power bank. It spools easily, and has four preset lengths, making it highly convenient to use.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

With this iteration of the Nexode power bank, I don't need to do that — having a built-in cable is just easier.

The best part is that UGREEN isn't charging anything extra for the retractable version of the Nexode 20,000mAh Power Bank.

But it’s not stopping at the chat screen, as this fresh new look could be starting to spread its wings across more parts of the app.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-profile-pages-material-3-expressive-apk-teardown-3573978/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug up something interesting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> v20250701 beta, suggesting that Material 3 Expressive buttons are heading to the profile page. You’ll spot the update when you tap a contact’s name at the top of a chat or hit their profile picture in the conversation list and tap the “i” icon.</p><p>The potential redesign zeroes in on the four main buttons under a contact’s number—Call, Video, Contact info, and Search. Instead of the usual round icons, they’re getting stretched into pill-shaped buttons.</p><h2 id="buttons-with-personality-2">Buttons with personality</h2><p>Additionally, they react when you tap them, gently expanding in width, then snapping back once you let go. It’s a small touch, but it adds a nice bit of flair and polish.</p><p>The new buttons are noticeably bigger, and they're totally in step with the Material 3 Expressive look that has been popping up across other Google apps lately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="WR5mUt62PcGGTiXyfyPptj" name="Google-Messages-Profile-page-M3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive buttons on the profile page in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WR5mUt62PcGGTiXyfyPptj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this feature only showed up after some manual tinkering by the folks at Android Authority. So, sideloading the Google Messages beta APK alone won’t flip the switch on its own.</p><p>Last month, Google was spotted working on changing the tabs for emoji, Photomoji, GIFs, and sticker panel in Messages. Instead of sitting side-by-side like before, they’re grouped in a neat, pill-shaped layout that makes each option stand out more. Tap one, and it pops with a richer color that matches your Material 3 theme.</p><p>Even the “plus” icon got some love, meaning the menu it opens now has slightly bigger, rounder buttons with a bit more breathing room.</p><p>There's no word yet on when this revamped contact page will hit the stable version since it’s still tucked away in the beta at the moment. But with Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">going all-in on Material 3 Expressive at present</a>, it's a safe bet that this update will make its way to everyone soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Someone accidentally dunked it in a river for way longer than it should handle, and it came out like nothing happened.</p><p>A recent Reddit post tells a wild story about the OnePlus 13’s water resistance getting pushed way past the limit. After a canoeing mishap during a camp trip, a kid accidentally left the phone underwater in a river for around 4.5 hours. Interestingly, when the father fished it out, it still worked.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1lq9z0k/this_is_a_photo_of_my_sons_camp_counselor_and_i">This is a photo of my son's camp counselor and I looking for my Son's OP13 in the Fox River.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus">r/oneplus</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>For  context, an IP68 rating means a device can handle being underwater over a meter deep for up to 30 minutes. It’s a solid standard for water resistance, but definitely not meant for long river naps.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 raised the bar for durability by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">being the first in the lineup to score both IP68 and IP69 ratings</a>.

But when tech-savvy folks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-12-waterproof/" target="_blank">tore it down</a>, they noticed design choices hinting it might’ve been tougher than the rating let on. That sparked a lot of debate about whether it was quietly more water-resistant than advertised.</p><p>Now, with this Reddit story about the OnePlus 13 surviving nearly five hours underwater, it’s safe to say OnePlus has leveled up in real-world durability.</p><p>IP69 is pretty much unicorn territory when it comes to smartphones. While a few Oppo models in select regions have quietly sported it, the OnePlus 13 is the first phone with IP69 protection to officially hit Western markets.</p><p>While most folks won’t be blasting their phone with high-pressure hot water, knowing the OnePlus 13 could handle it is pretty awesome.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The P10 Plus and P30 have interesting features, but they're at the costlier end of the scale as these products go.</p><p>The 512GB model of the P10 Plus magnetic SSD starts at $99, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aiffro-Magnetic-Portable-Lightning-Compatible/dp/B0F486G83B/">down to $85 on Amazon</a>.

I like that Aiffro included a magnetic ring in the package, so if you don't have a phone with a magnetic case, you can use the included accessory to attach it securely.</p><p>The magnetic SSD uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 standard and has the entire 20Gbps bandwidth available, and I didn't have any issues moving photos and videos from my phones to the P10 Plus. It goes up to 2,000MB/s, but given that most machines don't have the Gen 2x2 protocol, you'll see 1,000MB/s in actual use — which is more than adequate.</p><p>The only issue I have with the P10 Plus is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable is a little too short, so it is a bit of a hassle to plug it into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> — I had to use another cable to connect it. This isn't an issue with the Lightning to USB-C cable provided in the box, and I don't really get why the brand couldn't have bundled a USB-C to USB-C cable of the same length.</p><p>Anyway, outside of that quibble, I didn't see any problems using the P10 Plus with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. It has a thickness of just 6.5mm and a weight of 41g, and you get a cloth carrying bag that makes it easy to take it anywhere.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ASjY78Va4cC3aVN9oyYqf7" name="Aiffro P10 Plus and P30" alt="Aiffro P10 Plus and P30" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ASjY78Va4cC3aVN9oyYqf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Switching over to the P30, it is positioned as a 3-in-1 SSD, and it is pretty unique. It has a standard USB-C connector that lets you plug the drive into a phone, tablet, or Windows/macOS machine, and there are two additional USB-C ports: one acts as USB PD in, giving you the ability to charge your phone while the SSD is connected. The other USB-C port lets you slot in a mic and record to the SSD, a nifty addition.</p><p>The P30 goes up to 1,000MB/s reads and writes like most external SSDs, and coming in at 19g, it is one of the thinnest and lightest drives I used — I have regular flash drivers that are bigger. It is a pretty good solution if you're looking to shoot ProRes or Dolby Vision footage and need an external drive, and the metal chassis is built to last.</p><p>The P30 is available in 1TB and 2TB sizes, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aiffro-Portable-Supports-Microphone-Interface/dp/B0F487HY7L/">starts at $135 right now</a>. The P10 Plus is what I used a majority of the time, and that model can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Aiffro-Magnetic-Portable-Lightning-Compatible/dp/B0F486G83B/">bought for $85</a> as of writing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's why I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">switched to Kobo's Libra Colour</a> at the start of 2025; the e-reader features the latest E Ink Kaleido 3 tech, has a lightweight design that makes it comfortable to hold, and you can easily read comics on it thanks to the color E Ink panel.</p><p>Best of all, it has physical page turn buttons — a must-have on any good e-reader — and it charges via USB-C. I read dozens of books on the Libra Colour over the last six months, and it is the ideal upgrade to the Kindle Oasis. The e-reader usually costs $249, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXWGK79">now down to $209 on Amazon</a>, making it a terrific bargain.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2e30d76-cd79-4d9f-9eb5-9e4501b5bdd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Kobo Libra Colour" data-dimension48="The Libra Colour is better than the Kindle Oasis in several meaningful ways.

The Libra Colour has it all, and with IPX8 water resistance, you can use it in the tub.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a monochrome e-reader on a budget, and you need the Kindle Store.</p><p>The Libra Colour has a plastic chassis, but it doesn't feel like a budget e-reader in the least — Kobo did a good job with the overall design. The white version I'm using looks elegant, and it is also available in a black model. It feels good to hold and use, and isn't uncomfortable even during marathon reading sessions.</p><p>It has the two features I need the most in an e-reader: physical page turn buttons and adjustable warm light. The buttons were a little stiff when I got started with the Libra Colour, but they have good tactility now. You extensive configurability when it comes to adjusting the intensity of the LEDs, and just like the Kindle Oasis, you get a warm light that reduces eye strain.</p><p>A neat addition is the 7-inch color E Ink panel; it unlocks entirely new use cases, and it holds up while reading comics on the device. You can also use the Libra Colour as a journal, and it has stylus integration (there isn't one included in the package). The E Ink panel has 300ppi pixel density, and it is just as good as the one on the Kindle Oasis — with the added versatility of a color panel.</p><p>It has IPX8 ingress protection, so you can use the e-reader in the tub or near the pool. Another welcome addition is USB-C charging; it lasts two weeks between charges even if you read daily, and USB-C just makes it less of a hassle when you need to charge it. Kobo's ebook store isn't anywhere as extensive as Amazon's offering, but on the plus side, the Libra Colour isn't locked down in the same way, so you can easily bring your Kindle ebooks over to the device without any issues.</p><p>Overall, I didn't think I would like the Libra Colour as much as I did, and it is the Kindle Oasis upgrade I've always wanted. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXWGK79">in at $209</a>, now is the time to switch to the e-reader if you're still using a Kindle.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-22">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It took me a month to judge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-fitness-test-gps-heart-rate-steps-running-tolerance">Forerunner 970</a> experience in the context of past models. But the Venu X1 is such a bizarre unicorn of a smartwatch that there's no need for careful consideration or in-depth analysis. Let's talk about the most polarizing, oddball watch that Garmin has ever made!</p><p>I've seen the Reddit threads responding to early Venu X1 buyers, calling it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1lg6zzl/day_one_with_venu_x1/">"ugly AF"</a> or like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1la4xnd/799_venu_x1_looks_like_a_cheap_amazfit_watch/">"bad Apple Watch Ultra."</a> I think the reaction would be less <em>visceral</em> if the Venu X1 didn't cost $799, with no Venu 4 in sight. But it's still evoking the Apple design language, for a community that's spurned Apple Watches for years.</p><p>As a Garmin megafan, I can't help but laugh at the indignation, if only because Garmin watches...aren't good-looking, y'all. You're <em>accustomed</em> to the rugged design, but they're still bulky, thick, and lack the luxury style of a "normal" watch. The Venu X1 is merely a more artificial tang of the same bitter medicine we all take to get great fitness insights.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XdpJr2PQxZSwAaQyzBVYcB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Fenix-8-thickness" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Fenix 8 (right) sitting aside each other on a table, showing the difference in design and thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdpJr2PQxZSwAaQyzBVYcB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What more justifiably rubs Garmin hard-liners the wrong way is that this uber-skinny smartwatch has an eight-day battery life that falls to two days with always-on display (AOD), or just 14 all-systems GNSS hours, so you burn at least 7% battery per hour of tracking. Garmin watches usually last longer the more you pay; the Venu X1 inverts that expectation.</p><p>And outside the fitness sphere, the Apple fans Garmin is targeting will love the look but be bewildered by everything else.</p><h2 id="i-ve-never-worn-a-smartwatch-like-the-garmin-venu-x1-no-one-has-2">I've never worn a smartwatch like the Garmin Venu X1; no one has</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-side-view-buttons" alt="A side angle of the Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, the photo angled to show the two side buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkGxMwiEzRuX98JNARL35C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu X1's positives are primed to fall on deaf ears because of how it shakes up Garmin's status quo. And it's a shame, because <em>my goodness,</em> the X1 is comfortable to wear.</p><p>It takes up more wrist space than I'm used to, but once that's normalized, I <em>barely</em> notice it. Going from my 71g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> or 75g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8 47mm</a>, my 39g Venu X1 is heavenly, while showing me more data than I'm used to seeing. Most Garmin watches weigh about 50–55g, but without all that screen space.</p><p>And from the side, it's just so dang skinny! People might initially think the Venu X1 looks "unnatural" in top-down photos, but from the side in person, it looks proportional and unassuming on my wrist, where a normal smartwatch protrudes awkwardly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rbiqa8XRqgR2hghNKXAMaB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness-2" alt="A side view of the Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 (right) held in one hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbiqa8XRqgR2hghNKXAMaB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness-3" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Garmin Venu X1 (right), both worn on one wrist, showing the two watches' comparative thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>People who buy fitness bands like the 31g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> can get double the screen real estate of a fitness band for about a quarter-ounce of extra weight. They'll appreciate that the Venu X1 puts much less pressure on your wrist for sleep tracking than most smartwatches, too.</p><p>My fiancee, a regular Apple Watch wearer, loves the look and how thin it is, and doesn't mind that it's proportionally a bit large for her wrist in exchange for the size and brightness. And she <em>scoffed</em> at the idea that a week of battery life wasn't enough.</p><p>That's why the premise of a large, skinny watch wouldn't be so outlandish...if the Venu X1 didn't suffer from Garmin's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">post-tariff price inflation</a> and target Garmin's traditionalist power users with an $800 price tag.</p><p>The most obvious use case for a 2-inch, 448 x 486 display is maps, and Garmin's strict feature tier list means it won't put offline maps on a cheaper watch. It's frustrating, but consistent with Garmin's strategy. So rather than follow up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, Garmin made this new Ultra alternative with a full suite of tools that only hardcore users need.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-maps" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 (left) and Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) sitting aside each other on a lawn, both showing the same 9-mile hiking course, but the larger, square-shaped X1 display shows much more map info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmHBn8FrjesbKiyv8DW2MC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Look how much more data fits naturally on the Venu X1 that's squeezed awkwardly onto the Forerunner 970 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't wait to take the Venu X1 out on hikes and follow trails, or to plan out my golf shots on my local courses. And if you subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/893561/">Outdoor Maps+</a>, you can't get a better view unless you buy a GPS handheld.</p><p>Turn-by-turn navigation works on a circular watch because the focus is solely on the arrow, but this 2-inch squircle cuts off the limiters and lets you see more context around you, without needing to zoom out. The same goes for showing more buttons around the map edge without blocking content or making menus larger and more readable.</p><p>Like my Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8, the Venu X1 can be laggy when using maps, a consequence of Garmin's battery efficiency. Anyone used to an Apple Watch will probably care less about the extra topographic detail and wish it were as speedy as Apple Maps.</p><h2 id="the-garmin-venu-x1-is-caught-between-two-audiences-2">The Garmin Venu X1 is caught between two audiences</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-compass" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 worn on a wrist showing the ABC app with a compass, altimeter, and barometer data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's the main problem with the Garmin Venu X1: It can only be this skinny by lacking the CPU and RAM of traditional smartwatches or the long battery life of fitness watches.</p><p>Garmin's target audience (Apple converts) will miss their apps, messaging, and Siri. And the UI is liable to overwhelm them with information and premium fitness features that may not be relevant to their lives. The affordable, limited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a> is a better gateway for first-timers.</p><p>As for Garmin power users, the Venu X1 has nearly all the premium features of the Forerunner 970 in a more comfortable package. But these people are <em>accustomed</em> to perks like multi-week battery life and Up/Down buttons during training.</p><p>Other fitness watch fans would happily trade battery life for comfort...but they're not the ones who would spend $800. They'd rather spend $200 on a Fitbit.</p><p>That's why I think the Venu X1 will end up a niche device, too advanced and expensive for fitness casuals but too hamstrung by its skinny design for hardcore fans. But for those who hit that niche sweet spot, they'll absolutely love it: The Venu X1 is cozier and lighter than any other watch this size, the display is fantastic for displaying a ton of data, and it has nearly every feature the Fenix 8 does for $200–300 less.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As has been the tradition, Samsung’s summer event is usually host to its lineup of wearables and foldable phones. We’re expecting the same this time around, as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, and Galaxy Watch 8 are all likely to be unveiled.</p><p>All of this will lead up to the big event, as Samsung Unpacked is set to kick off on Wednesday, July 9 at 10 AM ET, taking place in Brooklyn, New York. And while there will be folks in attendance for the event, Samsung is also live streaming Unpacked as it unveils its latest batch of devices.</p><p>You’ll be able to follow along with the rest of us as the livestreams will be available both on Samsung’s website and the company’s YouTube channel.</p><p>Over the next few days, we’ll be taking a look at what’s happened in the past year, while also highlighting some of the key leaks and rumors. <br><br>And if you want to get the full picture, be sure to head over and check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><u>Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 Ultimate Guide</u></a> to learn everything there is to know.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cMS8qECR0A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Shortly after Samsung made the announcement regarding when Unpacked would be taking place, it also opened up its Galaxy Reserve program. All you need to do is provide your email address, and you’ll get $50 in credit, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/how-to-get-usd1-150-off-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-before-the-phone-even-officially-exists"><u><strong>saving up to $1,150</strong></u></a> on one of the new devices.</p><p>Not only that, but Samsung is also hosting a sweepstakes where you’ll be entered to win $5,000. Pretty wild if you ask me.</p><p>Time flies when you’re having fun, and we can’t believe it’s already been about six months since the last Galaxy Unpacked took place. Since January, we’ve seen an abundance of shiny new devices announced, including a few foldables here and there. Meanwhile, the Galaxy foldable rumor mill hasn’t slowed down, not one bit.</p><p>During Unpacked, Samsung is expected to reveal both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, the obvious successors to the Fold 6 and Flip 6 from last summer. However, there are rumors aplenty that we could see the Galaxy “G Fold,” and Galaxy Z Flip FE. On top of that, the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch Ultra 2 are likely to be announced, in addition to One UI 8 and the latest version of One UI Watch.</p><p>Starting off with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, many of us are hoping to see a meaningful redesign come to Samsung’s book-style foldable. For the most part, the last three generations have basically been spec bumps, while iterative improvements have been made to the hinge.</p><p>At first, this might not seem like all that big of a deal, that is, until you look around at the rest of the market. Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a far cry from the original Pixel Fold, which you might think was designed by a different company. While the OnePlus Open 2 never came to fruition, the Oppo Find N5 is as sleek and svelte as ever, complete with an array of excellent cameras to boot.</p><p>More recently, the Vivo X Fold 5 was unveiled, packed with a 6,000mAh battery and still managing to weigh just 217 grams. For reference, that’s more than 20 grams lighter than the Z Fold 6 with its paltry 4,400mAh battery.</p><p>In late 2024, Samsung did something rather surprising, as the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition was announced. It has a lot of the changes that we were hoping to see from the Fold 6, such as featuring a larger cover screen and a thinner chassis.</p><p>Arguably more importantly, Samsung also upgraded the primary camera, implementing a 200MP sensor compared to the 50MP lens in the Fold 6. Unfortunately, the Z Fold Special Edition was only released in China and Samsung’s home country, South Korea.</p><p>Nevertheless, it proved that Samsung is more than capable of releasing a foldable phone with the upgrades we’ve been clamoring for. Plus, a few of us would venture to guess that the Special Edition provided a glimpse at what’s in store from Unpacked.</p><p>If the leaks and rumors are true, we’re possibly looking at the biggest upgrade ever to the Galaxy Z Fold line. It would at least be on par with the upgrade from the original Galaxy Fold to the Galaxy Z Fold 2, which was pretty massive itself.</p><p>As for those rumors and leaks, Samsung’s latest foldable is said to feature a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8-inch inner display, up from the 6.2-inch and 7.6-inch Z Fold 6 screens. In April, @TheGalox_ claimed the Fold 7 will be “4.5mm unfolded,” however, a more recent rumor from Setsuna Digital suggests it will be 4.2mm when unfolded and 8.9mm when folded.</p><p>If Setsuna Digital is correct, that would give the Fold 7 the title of being the “thinnest foldable phone,” which is currently held by the Oppo Find N5 (4.21mm/8.93mm). What remains to be seen is whether Samsung will also be able to improve the inner display crease.</p><p>Later in April, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-folded-profile-speculation-report"><u>more rumors</u></a> seemed to corroborate previous reports of the Z Fold 7 taking the crown for thinnest foldable. More specifically, TechManiacs stated it would be just 8.2mm, while also sporting a “regular smartphone-like” design when folded.</p><p>Unfortunately, if this were to be done, it’s rather likely that Samsung would be dropping the S Pen digitizer. This is how the Z Fold Special Edition was able to be so much thinner than the Z Fold 6, as the digitizer shaves about 0.6mm of thickness from the phone.</p><p>As the calendar flipped into May, yet another report provided further confirmation of just how thin the Z Fold 7 is likely to be. But this time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-might-be-gunning-for-the-crown-as-the-worlds-thinnest-foldable"><u>@UniverseIce</u></a> reaffirmed what we already assumed about the battery of Samsung’s next foldable.</p><p>In order to make the phone thinner, this comes with some obvious sacrifices. The first is the aforementioned removal of the S Pen digitizer, and it seems that the Fold 7 will yet again sport a 4,400mAh cell. Meanwhile, Oppo’s Find N5 is just 8.93mm when folded, yet it packs a sizable 5,600mAh cell. Let’s just hope the processor efficiency has improved to at least give us some type of battery upgrade.</p><p>Fast forward a couple of weeks, and we were graced with what appeared to be our first “real world” look at the Z Fold 7. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-pictured-ahead-of-schedule-amid-rumours-of-titanium-switch.1019434.0.html"><u>only one picture</u></a> and didn’t really do much in the way of answering many questions.</p><p>However, it did give us a look at the rear camera array, and not much else. At the same time, a report claimed that Samsung was developing “a new S Pen that will be compatible with the Galaxy Z Fold7 upon release.” This would make sense if the digitizer is removed, but it will be interesting to see what actually happens.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 6 being an iterative update, Samsung needs to roll out meaningful changes to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to allow the foldable to stand out against its Chinese rivals. Samsung needs to address the width of the cover panel — it continues to be a challenge on its foldables — and put better cameras on the back of the Z Fold 7.</p><p>Galaxy AI is still a differentiator, but Chinese brands made positive strides in this area in the last 12 months, and it will be interesting to see if Samsung showcases any new features coming to the foldable.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is set to retain IP48 ingress protection, which is welcome news. Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, and while the rest of the industry has caught up, it’s good to see that the brand isn’t making any changes in this regard.</p><p>The Flip 7 will have the same durability as well, with Samsung maintaining parity between both devices. The latest devices by Chinese brands include IP58 as standard, and Samsung may look to increase the durability of its foldables next year with the introduction of the Z Fold 8 and Flip 8.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we may not see any major innovation around the design or battery this year, Samsung is set to bring its flagship 200MP camera to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and that’s exciting. Samsung foldables in general don’t have great camera packages, and it’s clear that the brand is looking to change that with the Z Fold 7.</p><p>The 200MP camera is likely to be the same used in the S25 Ultra, and that should allow the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to differentiate itself considerably in this category. We’ll need to wait and see if Samsung rolls out brand-new sensors for the telephoto as well as the wide-angle lenses, because that would make the Z Fold 7 just as good as the Galaxy S series.</p><p>If the latest leak is to be believed, Samsung is set to bring another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/a-new-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak-reveal-massive-cover-screen-in-action">sizable update to the Flip 7</a>. We could get a considerably bigger cover panel, and that has the potential to make the device that much more versatile.</p><p>It’s not just about the increased real estate either; Samsung could be pushing this as a way to showcase Now Bar, giving you real-time status updates. That alone makes the Flip 7 a little bit more interesting, and we don’t have to wait long to see just what changes Samsung is bringing to the diminutive foldable this year.</p><p>Chinese brands are outdoing one another when it comes to ultra-thin foldable designs.  Honor just rolled out the Magic V5, which is just 4.2mm unfolded, and Vivo’s X Fold 5 is just 4.3mm. Samsung is looking to follow suit with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and if initial leaks are any indication, the foldable could be just 4.2mm thick.</p><p>Of course, there’s the small matter of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 likely featuring a much smaller battery than its rivals. Samsung is said to be using the same 4,400mAh battery as last year; the Magic V5 has a 5,820mAh battery, while the X Fold 5 has an even bigger 6,000mAh battery. While it’s admirable that Samsung is aiming to deliver a sleek foldable this time around, there’s no question that a bigger battery would have been a much better choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-accessibility-zooming" alt="Using the upgraded zoom accessibility feature in One UI 8 to see an Android 16 logo on the Android Central website up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jLtR8LLsLAfxwBXuip4q7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Software is likely to be a big talking point at the launch event. Samsung has focused on Galaxy AI as a major point of differentiation, and the brand could share plans on what it has in store with the next iteration of One UI. It has been a contentious year in this regard, with the One UI 7 rollout facing significant delays.</p><p>The Android 16-based One UI 8 will most likely debut alongside the foldables, and it will be interesting to see where Samsung takes Galaxy AI as rivalry intensifies among handset makers. Google dominates this field thanks to a suite of AI features on its Pixels, and Chinese manufacturers are getting in on the action, often teaming up with Google to bring innovative features to their devices, like Honor’s image-to-video generation mode that was introduced on the Honor 400 Pro.</p><p>A side-effect of Samsung chasing ever-thinner designs is that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may miss out on stylus integration entirely.</p><p>It wouldn’t be too astonishing considering Samsung limited the feature-set of the stylus on the Galaxy S25 Ultra earlier this year, disabling its ability to serve as a remote shutter button. We’ll just have to wait and see what Samsung does in this area.</p><p>There definitely seems to be a bit of confusion in the Flip 7 rumor mill, as we're unsure whether Samsung will stick with Qualcomm or rely on the Exynos 2500 chipset. Initially, it was assumed that the Snapdragon 8 Elite would be at the helm, following suit with what we expect from the Fold 7.<br><br>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored"><u>late May</u></a>, an SoC model number was "discovered" in relation to the Exynos 2500, backed by claims that this would be used by all Flip 7 models. It would be a rather surprising change, even when you consider that Samsung moved from Qualcomm to MediaTek with the Galaxy Tab S10 lineup last year.</p><p>About a week later, another report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumors-arent-sure-if-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-will-use-snapdragon-or-exynos"><u>surfaced</u></a> that this wouldn't actually be the case. At least not entirely. The more recent rumor claimed that the Exynos 2500 would be at the helm in every region except for U.S., Canada, and China.</p><p>In doing so, that would mean that the Snapdragon 8 Elite would power the Flip 7 in the aforementioned trio of countries. Meanwhile, any other region where Samsung's flip phone was coming to would opt for the Exynos SoC.</p><p>This could be a make-or-break year for the Galaxy Z Flip series, as it sees continued pressure from other phone makers. Most notably, at least in the U.S., comes from Motorola, which recently released its refreshed Razr series of devices.</p><p>Headlining these is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review"><u>Razr Ultra</u></a>, which introduced an improved hinge and overall design. There's even a dedicated key to interact with Moto AI, something we've yet to see Samsung adopt. That is, unless you count the ability to activate Gemini with the Side Key as an "AI Key."</p><p>However, there is another Samsung foldable phone that has picked up steam in recent months with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Late last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025"><u>display analyst Ross Young reported</u></a> that the budget-friendly flip phone would launch alongside the Flip 7 and Fold 7.<br><br>Besides that, details were scarce, other than Young revealing that it would "carry the same display as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review"><u>Galaxy Z Flip 6</u></a> successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"><u>Galaxy Z Flip 7</u></a>."</p><p>Young provided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display"><u>further corroboration</u></a> back in January that the Flip 7 FE would re-use the Flip 6's display. This would mean that the FE will sport a Dynamic LTPO AMOLED screen with a 1080 x 2640 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and a peak brightness level of 2600 nits.</p><p>Around the same time, the Flip 7 FE made a surprise appearance on the GSMA database, carrying a model number of SM-F761B. As usually is the case, nothing else was revealed from this listing, besides providing confirmation of its existence.</p><p>While Young got through what the display of the Flip 7 FE might look like, we’ve heard some more chatter about its rear panel. It could also retain the Galaxy Flip 6’s folder-like cover screen, without the end-to-end screen. While it may look like the Galaxy Flip 6, a recent leak from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-specs-leak-next-to-sneak-peek-of-watch-8-models"><u> Roland Quandt stated</u></a> that the affordable FE variant could have the same screen space as the Galaxy Z Flip 7, measuring 4.1 inches when folded and 6.9 inches when unfolded.</p><p>Roland shared the alleged specs of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which indicate that the device’s design could be compact and accessible. It is rumored to come with a 50 MP primary lens, with 128 and 256 GB storage options, and a 4000 mAh battery. While it remains unclear what chipset this FE variant could get, the leak suggests that it will come loaded with Galaxy AI, just like the rest of the lineup.</p><p>If the rumors of a redesigned Fold 7 and Flip 7, along with the rumored Flip FE aren't enough to get everyone excited, Samsung might have something for you. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor"><u>November 2024</u></a>, reports surfaced suggesting Samsung would be releasing a "double-folding" smartphone sometime in 2025.</p><p>This came after Huawei's Mate XT made waves as a phone that unfolded twice, transforming from a 6.4-inch display to a 10.2-inch screen. Reports about Samsung's tri-fold seemed to suggest the screens would fold inward to avoid being "vulnerable to drops and impacts."</p><p>While the most recent rumor about Samsung’s tri-fold wasn’t fully focused on the device, it was spotted in a One UI 8 deep dive by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak"><u>AssembleDebug</u></a>. The rumor notes that Samsung's internal code refers to the device as the "Multifold 7." The number “7” hints at the fact that it could be teased along with the other devices during Unpacked.</p><p>The leak mostly shows support animations for the phone's functions. One animation shows off the trifold's folding process, which sees the left-most portion opening, revealing its full display. The tipster went further, stating that One UI 8's animation suggests Samsung has gone with two "inward-folding" panels. However, the software's animations warn that the two panels aren't of equal size, with the left one smaller than the right, indicating it should be folded in first.</p><p>A detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1942235635081003319"><u>leak of the spec pages</u></a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, and Flip 7 FE highlights what’s in store with Samsung’s 2025 foldables. It shows the Flip 7 and Flip 7 FE touting the Exynos 2500, with the Z Fold 7 powered by Qualcomm instead, suggesting this is a global variant and not the U.S. model.</p><p>What’s interesting is that there doesn’t seem to be much of a difference between the standard Z Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE; both have a similar-sized panel with identical resolution, same cameras and 4,300mAh battery, and internals. The biggest difference is that the FE model gets 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, with the regular version starting out at 12GB/256GB. We’ll have to wait and see if these pan out, but given the timing of the leak, it looks legitimate.</p><p>Interestingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1942235635081003319"><u>latest leak</u></a> reaffirms that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature a 200MP main camera, a huge upgrade over its predecessor. It’s likely Samsung is using the same sensor as the S25 Ultra, and that should allow the Z Fold 7 to take much better photos and videos.</p><p>The auxiliary lenses look to be unchanged, but we’ll know if that’s the case soon enough. The leak also lists Android 16 as the software, so it’s a decent possibility that Samsung will debut its foldables with One UI 8.</p><p>In addition to the foldables, we should get a new round of smartwatches. Samsung is likely to launch the Galaxy Watch 8, Watch 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025), with all models running the Exynos W1000 under the hood and One UI 8.0 Watch.</p><p>The Watch 8 is set to come in 40mm and 44mm sizes, while the Watch 8 Classic may have a 46mm case, and the Watch Ultra (2025) a 47mm size. While an initial leak suggested all models could get 64GB of storage, a recent leak indicates Samsung is sticking with 32GB.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-04" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uy8kf5a4mUAHnDdgksiEBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 set to debut with the Android 16-based One UI 8, let’s take a look at new features that might be coming to the foldables. Samsung rolled out One UI 8 beta builds last month, and the interface has a new multimodal AI engine that does a better job with contextualized information.</p><p>Most of Samsung’s Galaxy AI features are handled on-device, but the brand still relies on the cloud to power demanding tasks. We could see changes to the design as well, alongside new features being added to DeX, multitasking modes, and Samsung’s suite of utilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then I do both.</p><p>This year will be different; it <em>has</em> to be because I'm broke. Even if I wanted to buy a bunch of gadgety toys, I can't, because a life-changing medical issue and a whole lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/americas-rural-broadband-landscape-will-never-be-good-enough">expensive water damage</a> to my house have left me with no money, maxed credit cards, and bills to pay. The tank is dry, and now I have to fill it up again.</p><p>It's not all bad. I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> that will last me until at least next year, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> that will be updated for a while, and a drawer filled with gadget junk I've already bought that I can tinker with all over again.

Stuff like trash bags, laundry detergent, and assorted crap that everyone needs. I figure between Amazon and Walmart — which you know is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-target-deal-days-prime-day-sales">going to have a bunch of stuff on sale</a> to compete — we can actually save a few bucks in the long run by spending it up front. Every penny counts.</p><p>However, I also need to ensure that the things I <em>can't</em> afford to replace will last until I can. I have learned that it's always better to spend a few dollars in advance to try and prevent breaking or losing your stuff, which will cost a lot of money to replace. Things like phones.

The device sports a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with peak brightness up to 4500 nits (HDR) and 1600 nits (HMB), including 2160 Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> for eye comfort in low light and a 30Hz to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.</p><p>Nothing Phone 3 launches in India with a 5,500mAh silicon-carbon battery, powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chipset.  While the rest of the world gets a smaller 5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery, with speeds up to 65W, and 15W wireless charging. Preorders for the Nothing Phone 3 began on Friday, July 4, with prices starting at $799.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2PwVc93hayw2PFRBweAqjR" name="Nothing Headphone 1" alt="Nothing Headphone 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2PwVc93hayw2PFRBweAqjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we had our eyes on the Nothing Phone 3, the company also launched its first-ever over-ear headphones, which promise an immersive sound experience, intuitive controls, and stick to Nothing's usual "transparency" design.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">The Headphone 1</a> is bringing back retro in every sense of the word — controls that are more satisfying to work with, like the physical roller, paddle, and button controls.

One animation shows off the trifold's folding process, which sees the left-most portion opening, revealing its full display. The tipster went further, stating that One UI 8's animation suggests Samsung has gone with two "inward-folding" panels. However, the software's animations warn that the two panels aren't of equal size, with the left one smaller than the right, indicating it should be folded in first.</p><p>This is also backed by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Samsung continues to make the best of the situation, particularly on the Galaxy Z Flip 6's upgraded 50MP primary camera. As I noted in my review, I remain pleased with the images from the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review">I compared Galaxy Z Flip 6 images to the new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, and Samsung's flip phone managed to keep up in most situations. The color temperature is slightly cooler, but images can look very similar between the two in good lighting conditions. I find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> images to be a massive achievement for Motorola, but

low-light. Digital zoom quality actually somewhat compensates for the lack of a telephoto camera. While both phones offer lossless zoom at 2x, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes the lead at higher zoom ranges, maintaining a good level of detail even at 10x, whereas the Razr Ultra struggles.</p><p>Then there are low-light and nighttime images. Samsung does its best to brighten up photos, which can sometimes result in decent images. However, it can also overdo it, and images will come out fairly noisy, and as a result, images can look worse than those taken on the Razr Ultra 2025.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-05.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paWesQ48BXvhND8AyWkZCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But beyond picture quality, I've enjoyed actually <em>using </em>the cameras. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">The flip phone form factor enhances your camera experience</a> with its versatility, allowing you to capture selfies from the cover screen or enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-first-things#section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and">Camcorder Mode</a> for quick, easy, and stable video recording.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung continues to hide a ton of useful camera settings in its Camera Assistant app, which doesn't come preinstalled.

Samsung continues to hinder the cover screen experience in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5."</p><p>Derrek Lee, 'Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review'</p></blockquote></div><p>The cover screen experience on Samsung's Z Flip series has come a long way, particularly since the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>. The 3.4-inch external display carried over to the Z Flip 6, giving users more robust cover screen panels, messaging, full camera previews, and more. Yet, despite having all this room for activities, Samsung still hides and hinders its best cover screen features.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">I tested the Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> to see how I would fare using only the cover screen for 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus</a> offered a much better experience, thanks to the larger 4-inch screen, the ability to use apps out of the box, cover screen multitasking, a more connected experience overall when it comes to app transitions across displays, and the way notifications are handled.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is unfortunately hindered by its smaller and awkwardly shaped display and the fact that the use of apps on the cover screen is still not "officially" supported. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, you must go through Good Lock to enable an app panel, and even then, the experience feels half-baked.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 (left) and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cover screen is limited to the Samsung Keyboard, and it occupies nearly the entire screen when in use. Multitasking is non-existent, so you have to fully exit an app before opening another. Furthermore, Samsung's decision to avoid placing the cameras <em>on</em> the cover panel results in an awkward screen shape, and the experience of using apps feels a bit claustrophobic.</p><p>In my experience, the lack of apps on the cover screen hasn't been a dealbreaker for people who I've met who use the Z Flip 5 or 6. In fact, after I show them that they <em>can </em>add apps, it feels more like a nice bonus for them, which somewhat works in Samsung's favor.</p><p>That said, it's not all bad, and there have been signs that Samsung is learning. As mentioned earlier, the cover screen enables some unique camera tricks that you won't find on a traditional candybar phone. Samsung also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">added a new button with One UI 7</a> that somewhat streamlines the option to add cover screen apps, which is a step in the right direction.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-6-is-still-great-but-what-comes-next-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still great, but what comes next?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-26.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4206" height="2366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A year later, I still prefer Motorola's Razr series to Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6.

I also <em>love </em>One UI 7, and I'm not afraid to admit that I'd rather have it on the Razr than Motorola's Hello UX. Plus, with 7 years of updates, the phone should provide plenty of value for years to come as new features and capabilities are added over time.</p><p>And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Amazon Prime Day</a> right around the corner, it's never been a better time to snag one at a discount, as there are already some pretty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">impressive Samsung deals</a> out there, especially if you want a 512GB Z Flip 6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="889bab6a-2f1b-4610-b774-3ff9e9af3b7f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The 512GB Galaxy Z Flip 6 typically costs a pretty penny, and more than I would recommend anyone pay for this phone.

That's why comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024</a> wasn't as cut-and-dry as you'd expect. One was a notable step forward that really focused on design and the cover screen experience, while the other was more of a spec bump that focused more on performance. That's why it feels like there's so much riding on the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7, as it may finally introduce the features we've been hoping for.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung is expected to introduce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7#section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-finally-a-cheaper-flip-phone">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, which is rumored to be a more affordable flip phone option (at least compared to the Z Flip 7). If rumors are correct, this phone could offer a nearly identical design to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, albeit with an Exynos chipset, which could complicate the Galaxy Z Flip 6's place in the lineup.</p><p>However, if getting the latest and greatest Samsung phone isn't for you, I'm confident that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will be more than sufficient for most users, even in 2025.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone has an all-new design, better internals, UFS 4.0 storage, bigger battery, and a brighter AMOLED panel.</p><p>The GT 30 Pro costs ₹24,999 ($292) in India for the standard 8GB/256GB model, and there's a 12GB/256GB edition that's available for ₹26,999 ($316). The phone is trying to undercut the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a>, and that's no small feat.

Obviously, you won't get a camera as good as the Pixel 9a in this category, but considering what it costs, the GT 30 Pro has a good shooter overall. The auxiliary 8MP wide-angle is average, but it is more useful than the pitiful 2MP macro lens Infinix tacked on to the back of the GT 20 Pro last year.</p><h2 id="decent-software-with-a-caveat-2">Decent software — with a caveat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWXkBZn3L8BnZms4hQ7WhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GT 30 Pro runs Infinix's XOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the interface doesn't have too much in the way of overt customization. It is good to use and optimized to take advantage of the MediaTek hardware, but it is buggy at times. You don't get quite as much customizability as POCO devices, and like every other manufacturer, Infinix has a suite of AI utilities.</p><p>What's annoying is that the device will get just two software updates.

It doesn't have some of the extras that you get with high-end gaming phones, but that isn't a huge limitation when you consider what the phone costs.</p><p>The software is pretty good too, and my only issue with the phone is that it's limited to two software updates. Infinix has to do better with long-term updates, but other than that, the GT 30 Pro is one of the best budget gaming phones around.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7cac1840-692e-4d5b-aa9c-c5cfe4f16aa5">            <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/infinix-gt-30-pro-5g/p/itmd4bc1852572b9" data-model-name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:95.92%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mBSFmbZrAnhYDacHnpn9sf.jpg' alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Infinix GT 30 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>A stylish design, powerful internals, and good battery life make the GT 30 Pro a solid choice if you need a budget gaming phone. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Overall, the alleged Z Fold 7, as rumored, appeared thinner than the previous iteration.</p><p>All in all, we can’t wait to see how the upcoming foldable phones are going to officially look, and Samsung might be aiming for the masses with the launch of an even more affordable flip phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The post alleges the next V Flip is expected to see an upgrade in one department: its battery. DCS claims Honor is preparing a 1,770mAh and 3,600mAh battery setup inside the V Flip 2. Come launch, there's speculation that the market could see its battery capacity rated at around 5,500mAh.</p><p>It's charging still seems to be up in the air, as DCS suggests Chinese consumers could see 66W or 80W wired charging capabilities.</p><p>If you're expecting other major upgrades, that might not happen. DCS states that the V Flip 2 "has not changed much" from the clamshell's first appearance in 2024. Supposedly, the phone will still retain its 4-inch FHD Plus cover and 6.8-inch internal displays.</p><p>The post states Honor is reportedly chasing a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 series chip. The device could sport a 50MP dual camera array. Lastly, the tipster alleges that Honor is seeking an August 2025 release date for the Magic V Flip 2.</p><h2 id="looks-like-the-magic-v5-got-all-the-magic-2">Looks like the Magic V5 got all the...

The clamshell launched last June, essentially preparing to take on Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 the month after. The device launched with a 4-inch cover and a 6.8-inch internal display, which we've seen rumored once again for its sequel. While the camera looks to remain the same, too, the battery might see a boost over the original's 4,800mAh setup.</p><p>What's more, Honor's alleged choice to grab a "sub-flagship" Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 chip echoes what it did last year. The O.G. V Flip debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1.</a> The chip was a "refresh" of the flagship 8 Gen 1 that launched the fall prior—in 2021. So, Honor went for a two-year-old chip. With rumors claiming that Honor will do it again—"again" meaning a sub-flagship chip—perhaps we're looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</a></p><p>We'll have to wait and see where things lie, especially if we're to expect this phone in a month.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor revealed its Magic V5</a> this week. The company's thinnest-ever foldable is a sleek new piece of competition for Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. When folded, the phone measures 8.8mm (4.1mm when opened). Display-wise, Honor outfits the phone with a 7.9-inch internal display and a 6.4-inch cover screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster claims the Pixel Watch 4 will be available in a 41mm and a 45mm option. The company is also preparing the following color/band color choices: Black/Obsidian, Gold/Lemon, Silver/Porcelain, Silver/Iris, and Moonstone.</p><p>What's unclear is if both size options will see the same color options. If we remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">the Pixel Watch 3</a>, its 41mm and 45mm options don't feature the same stylistic choices, as the former tosses in a Champagne color and even a Rose band.</p><p>Regarding the next-gen bands, the tipster states the Pixel Watch 4 will see a multitude (roughly seven) bands with different colors. The Woven band is rumored to arrive in Indigo, while the two-tone leather option could see a Jade choice. There's an Active Band (Iris, Lemongrass, Moonstone), an Active Sports Band (Indigo, Lemongrass, Moonstone, Peony), and a Classic Leather in Moonstone.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead-to-the-pixel-watch-4-2">Looking Ahead to the Pixel Watch 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Pixel Watch 4:WiFi/LTE41mm/45mmBlack/ObsidianGold/LemonMoonstoneSilver/IrisSilver/Porcelain<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1941026391648358465">July 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Metal Mesh band could debut in Matte Black and Polished Silver, leaving the Performance Loop in Moonstone.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster alleges the following Gradient Stretch band options in sizes one through five:</p><ul><li>Lemongrass/Frost</li><li>Moonstone</li><li>Obsidian/Hazel</li><li>Peony/Iris</li></ul><p>Pixel Watch 4 rumors have been light so far; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">a massive render leak</a> from April left us a little impressed. The supposed images showed off a watch that is looking to improve its display experience. The Pixel Watch 4 may sport thinner bezels under the circular domed glass aesthetic that's become enjoyable. There were some alleged changes, like the removal of its charging pogo pins.</p><p>It's left to speculation to believe that Google is working on introducing a wireless charging method for its next watch. Elsewhere, the rumored renderings showcased two extra cutouts on either side of the device's speaker, likely for its physical buttons.</p><p>One concerning aspect was the Watch 4's supposed thickness increase; however, that could be a result of a bigger battery.</p><p>This is also the second time we've heard a tipster claim the watch will arrive in 41mm and 45mm options, so perhaps there's merit. Either way, we're expecting the Pixel Watch 4 to debut alongside the Pixel 10 series, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">could take place in late August</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been using an Apple Watch user for a while now, starting with a Series 6 and later upgrading to a Series 8 when it was released three years ago. So for about five years now, I've had a bulky square-ish dial on my wrist- and I still do, as I type this article. On the flip side, I've owned the Oura Ring 4 for only about 3 weeks now, and it has become this silent source of encouragement pushing me to take care of myself while I go about my life.</p><p>As a first-time mom, my sleep cycle has been erratic, to say the least, with frequent nightly wake-ups to feed my infant. This is exactly why I needed to know if I was getting optimal rest and if my health was truly supporting my ability to function during the day. This was the primary reason behind trying out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, which, when compared to a smartwatch, is manageable to sleep with.</p><p>Now, I use the Oura Ring 4 all the time as an overall health tracker, while the Apple Watch sticks to being my fitness companion.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day returns July 8th: check out our ultimate guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/axmwd7zeesP3HfUoZLueME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-nonsense-sleep-tracking-2">No-nonsense sleep tracking</h2><p>While setting up my Oura Ring, the app asked me a bunch of questions to determine whether I had any special circumstances or health issues that could impact my readings, to which I ticked off the option of having small kids at home, acknowledging the fact that this could affect my sleep score.</p><p>For instance, after a night of only about 5.7 hours of sleep, my Oura Ring app presented a detailed picture of my breathing patterns and heart rate, in addition to the standard awake time, REM sleep, deep sleep, and so on. This analysis put things into perspective for me, and the app gave me suggestions as to how I could avoid a long afternoon nap so I could get my sleep cycle back in sync, asking me to wind down during the night with a book or a quick mindfulness session, or taking steps to improve my sleep quality at night. While the advice didn't stem from the fact that I was frequently waking up because my infant needed me, it did give me actionable items that helped me understand my sleep scores better.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 tracks sleep using a special "Smart sensing" technology that involves a combination of advanced sensors that are fitted into the ring, along with machine-learning algorithms that are specifically trained to track different stages of sleep. It also has sensors that track your oxygen, heart, and respiratory rate to understand how your body functions when you sleep.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Sleep tracking on Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rrzstrShf3p2a8XygpWej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="oura-s-ai-powered-advisor-2">Oura's AI-powered Advisor </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4" name="Oura-Ring-4" alt="Oura Ring 4 Stress detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHvs3HGdtSYjicdggj9BZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who is constantly juggling multiple responsibilities — from managing my role as a News editor, and also navigating the unpredictable challenges that come with having an infant, stress can easily become something that goes under the radar, manifesting as a headache or just pure anxiety, as I transition between home and work, without a moment to myself.</p><p>This is when Oura's AI-powered Advisor comes into play. The sensors constantly monitor my physiological state, and when the smart ring tracks that I'm experiencing elevated levels of stress based on my heart rate variability (HRV), the app instantly sends me a quick notification to take a look at the stats and possibly step back and "breathe the stress away" with a quick four-minute mindfulness session that gives me the much needed moment of calm amidst the daily chaos.</p><p>Beyond that, the Oura Ring 4 also doubles as a subtle activity coach. Instead of constantly bugging me with reminders to "close rings", it gently nudges me to get in 3-4 minutes of movement when it detects longer periods of inactivity.  While I still track my workouts with the Watch, these soft reminders from the Oura Advisor actually play a crucial role in keeping me on track with my fitness goals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA" name="Oura-metabolic-features" alt="Oura annouces new features to track meals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTBvfVcAJsTFwoNBDcWiHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While those were the main reasons why I primarily use the Oura Ring 4, I sometimes also track my steps with it when I don't have my watch on. However, another cool feature that I'm currently experimenting with is "Meals," a super-easy way to keep track of what you're eating in a day. Unlike traditional food tracking apps that require users to manually input data, which again is time-consuming to me, all I have to do is take a picture of my plate, and this AI feature will break things down for me. It shows me each "Meal Item" and the nutrients my plate contains, helping me reach for healthier options.</p><p>So if you're a first-time mom juggling work and the challenges that come with having a tiny human at home, then this ring-sized motivator is for you. It will keep track of your sleep, stress, and sanity. The best part is that you don't have to reach for the charger as often as you would for an Apple Watch, as it offers up to 8 days of battery on a single charge.</p><p>While the Oura Ring 4 (starting around $349) is on the more expensive side, it's worth noting that the Oura Ring 3 has currently crashed back to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Tracking-Wearable-Fitness/dp/B0D9WVSZ56"><strong>lowest price at Amazon ahead of Prime Day,</strong></a> offering a more accessible entry point into Oura's excellent tracking capabilities.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.27%;"><img id="JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5" name="oura-ring-gen-3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZJBFcjUeoiAA6ntbDbch5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1249" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 (Heritage Silver):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRLTZGL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a204f539-7986-4c6d-88af-34bdfa5a8eab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.00" data-dimension48="$249.00" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.00</del> <strong>$199.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Days before <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq">Prime Day</a> officially kicks off on July 8th, buyers can get $50 off the Oura Ring 3 smart ring, representing a 20% discount on a great last-generation device.

The only phone that has managed to pull me away has been the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/googles-on-the-right-track-with-desktop-mode-in-android-16">Desktop Mode has arrived with Android 16</a>.</p><p>Why is that a problem?

It's kind of like how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> looked like it was supposed to originally launch in 2020, but for whatever reason, was held back until 2023.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the Z Fold Special Edition was basically proof that Samsung could release a modern foldable with better cameras, a bigger screen, and all of the things I've been hoping for. So when we see reports and rumors about sales figures being down, it doesn't come as a shock, considering that it's really just Samsung, Google, and Motorola in the space, at least until we get a proper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open successor.</a></p><h2 id="why-do-i-keep-coming-back-2">Why do I keep coming back?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if the hardware and specs are such a letdown, why do I keep coming back to the Z Fold 6 at all? Everything else.</p><p>The thing about this phone is that if I really had to, I could use this for literally everything. Its narrow cover screen is great for doom-scrolling or replying to messages, and if I need more space to spread out, I can just unfold it. If I need to sketch something out or jot down a note, I can just grab an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen</a> and be on my way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need even more space? Then I can plug in my handy-dandy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a> and turn the Fold 6 into a laptop via DeX. And if I'm <em>really</em> in a pinch, then I can pair my Samsung ultrawide monitor with the Fold 6 and use DeX that way. But that's more a last-ditch effort kind of thing since DeX doesn't really play nice with ultrawide monitors.</p><p>And when it comes to multi-tasking <em>without</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX</a>, Samsung has my current favorite implementation. Basically, there aren't any major limitations. I'm able to have more than two or three apps appear on the screen, and can easily swap them out or just pull up a floating window. Admittedly, the only time I do that is to access my password manager or if I'm watching football while checking fantasy scores.</p><h2 id="surprising-discovery-2">Surprising discovery</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens-angled.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one thing I've noticed regarding the design, and it's that I'm much more likely to use the inner screen on the Fold 6 than the other foldable phones I have. It's not like I can't do anything from the cover screen, but it's simply too narrow.</p><p>That's not the case with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which features the same 6.3-inch display as the Pixel 9 Pro. I'd be lying if I said that there haven't been days when I don't use the inner screen on the 9 Pro Fold. But unless my memory is failing me, I can't remember a day when I didn't unfold the Z Fold 6 at least once.</p><p>Naturally, I'll be paying closer attention to this once I get my hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, provided that the rumors and leaks are true about the larger screens.</p><h2 id="battery-life-is-awful-2">Battery life is awful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-battery-settings" alt="Battery settings on Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVqsULGGvGKFz8YihJWDYM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gripes about the hardware aside, that's not the only area that Samsung needs to improve on. Battery life on the Fold 6 has been absolutely atrocious. More often than not, it won't last until the early evening without needing to be charged to make it through the rest of the day.</p><p>Obviously, a foldable is a bit different when compared to a slab phone, but surely Samsung knows that this isn't good enough. I'm not even talking about charging speeds, but having the 4,400mAh battery is the smallest of the other recent foldable phones. Vivo recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-bridging-the-gap-android-apple-watch-launch">X Fold 5</a> and managed to squeeze a 6,000mAh battery, while the Find N5 offers a 5,600mAh cell.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 battery stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBifQQJF8n4WyZKjCNuWh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I understand there are ways to try and remedy this, but I didn't take any of those approaches. For one, it's extremely annoying and time-consuming to reset and restore a phone, especially one that you've been using for the better part of a year. More importantly, I would have to assume that the majority of people don't wipe and restore their phones once a year, so I decided against doing so.</p><p>Everything was fine in the beginning, easily making it through a day. But less than a year later, the Fold 6 barely lasts eight hours, and that's just unacceptable.</p><h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on top of Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQja9cmEBV6Bs9MBcqfnxk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's kind of a weird thing, as I've been trying to gather my thoughts and feelings, but just coming back to the same conclusion: I'm beyond ready for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Samsung was once at the top of the mountain when it came to foldable phones, but stood pat while the competition ran circles around them.</p><p>All of the leaks and rumors suggest that Samsung will be implementing quite a few new changes. I'm of the mindset that it'll basically be the Z Fold Special Edition, with newer internals while hopefully retaining S Pen compatibility.
