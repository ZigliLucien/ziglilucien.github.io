There are two major updates Google is reportedly testing, one of which involves a more smartphone-friendly (one-handed) rework. According to the publication, this rework involves the Docs app's formatting tool. Google has been spotted moving this tool down to the bottom of the app's UI, in the toolbar that typically houses the bold, italics, bullet point, and other options.</p><p>The post even highlights an alert that Google could deliver once this update arrives, which draws attention to the formatting tool's new home.</p><p>The bottom bar is also getting a small, but useful, change. In conjunction with the tipster AssembleDebug, the post states that the toolbar at the bottom of a Doc on Android could be "horizontally scrollable."</p><p>Another more noteworthy update spotted in testing concerns new filters in Docs for Android. These filters can be applied to searches in the app, and include filters for file type, people (file owner), and modified (when it was last changed). Filtering your content by type will surface any stored documents, presentations, and spreadsheets.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="NLeNdqygGUU3gbukBozUHB" name="google-docs-android-formatting-tool-moved-better-use" alt="Google Docs on Android is supposedly testing a new home for its formatting tool, which could place it at the bottom for better/easier smartphone use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NLeNdqygGUU3gbukBozUHB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="F9WCeoT633nmp9GUxbCxGB" name="google-docs-android-filters-spotted-testing" alt="Google has been spotted testing a new array of filters for its Docs app on Android, such as "type," "people," and "modified."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9WCeoT633nmp9GUxbCxGB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Bringing all this together is Google's Material 3 Expressive design language, which the tipster states has been spotted in the test.

Android users got Gemini's intelligence for quick document summaries and the ability for the AI to answer your questions about files. Moreover, Gemini's appearance could help users get that rough draft out quicker by compiling their early thoughts into something they can work with.</p><p>Gemini in Google's Workspace apps didn't stop there, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-workspace-gets-a-much-needed-boost-with-geminis-new-smarts">a major AI drop</a> brought personalized suggestions based on your data for Calendar, Gmail, Keep, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The new feature, called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>, doesn’t simply read web pages word for word. Instead, it uses Google’s AI to condense the content and present it as a lively conversation between two digital hosts.</p><p>The latest stable Chrome for Android update (version 140.0.7339.124) quietly packs a new AI audio tool, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-android-audio-overviews-rollout-3599751/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>’s Mishaal Rahman. It turns webpage text into a lively, podcast-style summary.</p><p>Using two separate AI voices, the feature presents articles as a back-and-forth conversation, making content clearer and more accessible than a standard monotone read-aloud.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-conversation-not-a-monotone-2">It's a conversation, not a monotone</h2><p>Rather than reading the whole article, the tool serves up a quick, podcast-style chat that hits the main points. This is a step up from basic text-to-speech, and it borrows heavily from Google’s NotebookLM and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> projects, where Audio Overviews first appeared before making their way into Chrome.</p><p>To give it a try (assuming your device has it), open any webpage you’d like summarized, tap the three-dot menu, and select “Listen to this page.” In the playback controls, you’ll now see an option to switch to the Audio Overview mode instead of the standard read-aloud.</p><p>It’s built to be way more interesting than a flat, monotone voice droning through a webpage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The feature is rolling out in stages, so even with the right version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, you might not see it right away. Google uses this approach to catch and fix any hiccups before pushing it to everyone.</p><h2 id="best-for-long-reads-2">Best for long reads</h2><p>Once it’s available to you, this feature is most useful for long or information-packed articles where a fast summary saves time. Shorter pieces work fine with the standard read-aloud, but the conversational style is ideal when you’re busy or just want to give your eyes a break.</p><p>Beyond convenience, Google’s rollout of Audio Overviews to Chrome is a reminder that the web doesn’t have to be a wall of text. By turning articles into audio, it’s helping out folks with visual impairments and anyone who’d rather listen on the go or just can’t be bothered to read another endless scroll.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The imagery shows off the alleged phone from the side, with glimpses at its display and camera array. The leak suggests the Edge 70 will sport a flat display with rounded corners, a design choice that's become commonplace in the industry.</p><p>The image is also pushing the idea that the phone will be thin, stating, "impossibly thin and incredibly tough."</p><p>When we get to the rear panel, the camera array is slightly different from what we've seen Motorola provide this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">Moto Edge 2025 (Edge 60)</a> and even the Edge 2024 (Edge 50). Instead of being nestled against the top left corner, the camera array takes space a little further into the back panel, leaving space between it and the side. It seems the Edge 70 could sport three cameras on its slightly raised array.</p><p>Additionally, Motorola could have some colored accents inbound for the phone. The alleged promo material shows the camera could be raised off the array, kind of like what you'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">find with Samsung</a>. Those raised lenses could have colored rings around them.</p><h2 id="the-rumors-have-changed-2">The rumors have... changed?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boom. pic.twitter.com/zwX9cYJyNp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1970146975820796289">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We started hearing about Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-70-leaks-reveal-familiar-design-and-potential-specs">next Edge series model</a> back in May. Back then, the rumors were different, as posts claimed the device would remain similar to what we've seen this year with the Edge 60 and with the Edge 50 in 2024. Rumors claimed Motorola was sticking to its curved-edge display and a camera system positioned in the corner on the back of the phone.</p><p>The alleged renderings back then pointed toward as much, while also showing off lenses that were flush to its array, not lifted like we've seen rumored today.</p><p>It's difficult to tell which way we're going, especially since rumors now conflict. As far as launch goes, nothing's really certain. Older rumors claimed we would see it this month, perhaps around September 24. That's only a day away, and Motorola hasn't exactly hyped up a new Edge recently. So, we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>There were a few more rumors mentioned in those older leaks, such as the Edge 70 may rock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7200-launch">MediaTek's Dimensity 7000 SoC</a> and 12GB of RAM. The Edge's predecessor featured a 50MP primary, a 10MP telephoto, and a 50MP ultrawide lens, so speculation says we could see something close to this again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sharge is a Chinese accessory manufacturer that likes to push the boundaries of design. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-shargeek-170-power-bank-review">Sharge 170 power bank</a> has a uniquely aggressive style, and it manages to turn heads whenever I travel with it. The brand branched out into SSD enclosures earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-disk-review">Disk</a>, which is basically a housing designed to slot in an M.2 2230 drive.</p><p>The Disk Pro is the natural evolution of that product. The product is an external SSD that doesn't look anything like its rivals; I recently tested the Neil Poulton-designed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-ssd4-4tb-ssd-review">LaCie Rugged SSD4</a>, and while that drive stands out because of the vibrant silicone shell, the Disk Pro is in an entirely different league.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4805" height="2707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thinking of the Disk Pro as another external SSD is reductive, as it manages to be so much more than that. Yes, it has 1TB of storage and a built-in USB-C cable that makes connecting to phones and tablets highly convenient, but you also get active cooling in the way of an integrated fan. The biggest highlight is that the SSD gets an HDMI port alongside two USB-A ports, turning it into a portable dock. Oh, and did I mention it has magnets at the back that lets you attach it to the back of your phone?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5054" height="2847" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, this is an external SSD and a dock all turned into one. The Disk Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/disk-pro">just debuted on Kickstarter</a>, and it costs $189 for the 1TB model that I'm using. There's also a 2TB model that costs $289, and a 4TB variant that costs $469.</p><p>Obviously, design is a key talking point with the Disk Pro; Sharge once again managed to deliver a product that stands out visually. The external SSD has a see-through design with bright accents and a yellow USB-C cable that's integrated into the chassis, and it looks cool.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="48gk4XaXVMmHo6N3aGeET5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/48gk4XaXVMmHo6N3aGeET5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a physical button on the SSD to toggle the drive; this is useful if you just want to use the Disk Pro as a dock instead of needing the storage. The built-in fan only activates when needed, but the dedicated button lets you enable turbo mode, allowing it to run constantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gTUtKtP64oCyvdtXqb7Va5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTUtKtP64oCyvdtXqb7Va5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4916" height="2769" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Disk Pro isn't that much bigger than a regular external SSD, and the versatility that you're getting is unmatched. While it may not be that useful when connected to a phone, the real potential of the Disk Pro is with handheld gaming consoles. The ability to increase the storage while having the flexibility to connect to a keyboard and mouse and plug into a monitor or TV via HDMI — all from the same device — is just great, and the Disk Pro shines in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5052px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wqJp9KWxGH7BhNiimpibY5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqJp9KWxGH7BhNiimpibY5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5052" height="2846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As an external SSD, it doesn't get anywhere as fast as its rivals; bandwidth is limited to a maximum of 1000MB/s, and that's less than a third of what the Rugged SSD4 and other external drives manage. That said, the transfers are more than adequate in the context of moving data around, and I didn't see any problems with this when using the Disk Pro with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hNfY8pr3EQhGyCZYRr2S75" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hNfY8pr3EQhGyCZYRr2S75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I got the 1TB model of the Disk Pro, but you can get it with up to 4TB of storage, giving you the ability to significantly boost the built-in storage of your phone or handheld console. Another differentiator is the magnets; the ability to securely attach the SSD to a phone makes it all the more convenient while traveling, and this is a big win.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7xndzxCoYPheQTmWfucDT5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7xndzxCoYPheQTmWfucDT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5112" height="2879" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the whole, I like what Sharge did with the Disk Pro; the product is marketed as a portable SSD, but it also doubles as a dock if you need it, and the built-in cooling ensures it doesn't overheat. I used it for the better part of two weeks, and overheating wasn't a problem whatsoever. If you want an all-in-one device with storage and USB ports, the Disk Pro is a good choice to consider.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After a year of moving things around, buying new furniture, and reading unhelpful articles online, I finally pulled out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> in a moment of frustration and turned to Gemini for help. I didn't expect much, but was blown away by what Google AI came up with.</p><p>Here's how I used AI to solve a complicated interior design issue, and how you can use it to help with your own problems too.</p><h2 id="giving-gemini-the-right-starting-point-2">Giving Gemini the right starting point</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-4" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with my apartment is simple: it's fairly large, but there's only one window in the living room, kitchen, and dining area. The window is actually a sliding glass door, and is flanked by perpendicular walls with double doors, which limits furniture placement. With one natural light source, the wrong layout could make this long and relatively narrow living space feel dark and bland — that's why I needed to turn to AI.</p><p>AI is worst when you don't point it in the right direction, and best when you provide it with ample context and thorough prompts. Instead of giving Gemini a vague and generic prompt, I found the exact floor plan for my space for context and clearly stated my goals. The prompt doesn't have to be lengthy, but it does need to be thoughtful and specific.</p><p>In this case, after providing the floor plan, I asked Gemini how to lay out the living room to get the most lighting.</p><h2 id="gemini-s-personalized-and-specific-help-2">Gemini's personalized and specific help</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-2" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini quickly responded with some general tips, like avoiding blocking the light source, using reflective surfaces, and choosing light colors. These were helpful in their own right, but giving Gemini an understanding of the floor plan returned personalized results. The chatbot understood that "the living room is a central, long space with a large window at the end."</p><p>It sounds simple, but Gemini having a basic understanding of the layout already gave it a massive advantage over search engines or interior design websites. As an example of how, one of the sites I read suggested renovating the room to change the positions of windows and doors, which was laughably unhelpful for a renter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-1" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> provided three detailed suggestions, and I went with the "open flow" layout. This involves floating a couch in the middle, facing the glass door, creating an open concept in the room. To avoid moving stuff around like a madman, I asked Gemini to come up with a few examples of what this would look like in my space — another thing I couldn't have done without AI.</p><p>The other cool thing about using AI for problem-solving and brainstorming is that you can ask further questions as you go.

If you don't provide an AI chatbot with ample context, it only has its training material to go off of, which can lead to unhelpful results. You can go about providing context in a few ways, such as providing AI photos or screenshots, like I did with my apartment's floor plan. Or, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">use features like Gemini Live that share your surroundings</a> via your phone's camera, which are other ways to provide context.</p><p>From there, be sure to write a thorough prompt that clearly explains your goals and what you need AI to do. You should use complete sentences for the best results, but avoid writing long paragraphs. Lastly, don't forget that you can refine your prompts as you go and steer the AI chatbot in the right direction. This can help if at first the AI doesn't provide the results you're expecting from your prompt.</p><p>With these factors in mind, you can get AI to help you with almost anything, whether it's gardening or interior design — or something else completely.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ebfc553d-203e-4065-b563-014c5363285a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best AI phone</strong></em></p><p>While plenty of phones can use the Gemini app, the Google Pixel 10 is the best one on the market for Google AI. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

They're the exact same as the first-generation model, but that's because they didn't need changing. The Bluetooth earpiece-style appearance of the earbuds does make them look a bit dated, although the design helped Bose cram battery life and audio gear into this package.</p><p>QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are certainly on the larger side; however, the big surface on the outer side of the earbud provides plenty of room for swipe gestures and media control. There are no buttons on the earbuds, just the capacitive touch area, which can be personalized in the Bose app on iOS and Android.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-4" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud and its ear tip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have issues with certain earbud styles staying in my ear securely, and naturally, I thought the large footprint of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) would pose an issue. My experience turned out to be the complete opposite.</p><p>The silicone ear tips with a built-in earwax guard, the stability bands, and overall design combine to create a secure and comfortable fit. You get three pairs of ear tips and stability bands each in the box to tailor your fit. The stability bands are crucial — they're silicone inserts that rest against your outer ear and ear lobe to add another point of security.</p><p>I took the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) on multiple runs, and became even more impressed with their fitment. I can comfortably say these earbuds offer the best fit of any pair that doesn't have a physical ear hook for stability. My typical running earbuds are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, which have an ear hook, but the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) felt just as secure. In fact, the Bose earbuds actually felt better in the ear, but they're lacking the hooks for peace-of-mind.</p><p>In other words, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are more than suited for comfortable, everyday wear and can even handle double duty as a workout pair. They do only have an IPX4 water-resistance rating, so be wary of sweat and rain.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-8" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are more changes when it comes to audio and ANC, but the overall experience is the same. You still get Bluetooth 5.3 support and compatibility with AAC, SBC, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">AptX Adaptive codecs</a>. Unfortunately, support for AptX on phones isn't as good as we'd like it to be, so you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">may need a transmitter</a> to take advantage of the earbuds' 24-bit lossless support.</p><p>In terms of sound, the QuietComfort Ultra (Gen 2) deliver the best bass performance I've ever heard out of a pair of wireless earbuds. It doesn't seem to come at the expensive of the rest of the soundstage, with mids and highs still present. The earbuds have an Immersive Audio mode for those that like a spatial effect, and the Bose app adds a stellar EQ that lets you tune the sound signature to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-10" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Bose earbuds prioritize bass much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-put-oneplus-buds-4-up-against-buds-pro-3">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Nothing Ear 3</a>, I find that their sound profile doesn't change the listening experience for indie and jazzy tracks — that's a good thing. So, even though you can adjust the EQ if you find the earbuds too bassy, you probably won't need to.</p><p>Bose is using AI to provide better ANC and call quality, and it leads to impressive results. Aside from the basic ANC and Aware modes, there's a new ActiveSense mode here that offers transparency while still blocking out extreme burst of noise. Think a police siren or a passing train near a busy street. It's impressive, and I successfully used the ANC to cancel out noise on part of an intercontinental flight, even though I'd still prefer over-ears for that specific use case.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-6" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud with the Bose logo facing outward." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buyer's guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025"><strong>Best ANC earbuds</strong></a></p></div></div><p>There are only two clear drawbacks to the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) worth pointing out. The first is that the capacitive touch controls are lackluster, and had me wishing for physical buttons. They don't miss any gestures or tap, which is great, but are a little overeager. Adjusting the fit of your earbuds by twisting them into your ear will probably pause your music, which can be frustrating at times.</p><p>Earbuds like Powerbeats Pro 2, which have a play/pause button and volume rocker, provide a better on-earbud experience than Bose — that's too be expected. But other earbuds with capacitive earbud stems, such as the AirPods Pro 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, are also better at avoiding accidental inputs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-2" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds with their case opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, there's a battery life. It's great that the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) now come with a wireless charging case as standard. Before, you had to add a clunky wireless charging cover for an extra $50 to add that feature.</p><p>However, the six-hour battery life per earbud is unimpressive. The charging case only brings that total up to 24 hours, so heavy users like myself find themselves needing to charge the case multiple times per week. It's also worth noting that if you turn on Immersive Audio, that'll fall to just four hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>Six hours of playback time isn't out of the ordinary with ANC enabled, but it's barely enough to cover my regular flight from Phoenix to New York, and it won't last a full workday. Apple just added eight-hour battery life to the AirPods Pro 3, so the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are starting to lag behind in this regard.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's never been more competition for great wireless earbuds for ANC, so Bose had its work cut out for it when making the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2). I think they're the pair of wireless earbuds to beat — other products might beat Bose in one or two areas, but none match the complete experience. For instance, I've been testing the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 against the Bose earbuds, and Apple's earbuds are better at battery life and noise canceling but are still severely behind in comfort and fit.</p><p>I'd also give Bose the edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</a>, which simply cannot fit in my ears comfortably, and don't sound as good in my view. The closest competitor in sound may be the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which are similarly full in the low-end but don't fit as securely and have worse ANC.</p><p>As such, if you have $299 to spend on ANC earbuds with excellent fitment, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are your best option.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-should-you-buy-them"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want industry-leading comfort and a secure fit for workouts</li><li>You crave a full and deep sound signature with excellent bass</li><li>You need platform-agnostic ANC earbuds that work with any Bluetooth device</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You find the earbud and charging case size to be too large</li><li>You'd rather buy a cheaper pair of earbuds closer to the $200 price point</li><li>You don't like the earbuds' loud audio profile and booming bass</li></ul><p>Bose delivers fantastic sound and great ANC on the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2), but so do many other audio brands. What separates the Bose earbuds from the field is their top-notch comfort and fit. While you might expect them to be uncomfortable or finicky due to their large size, the opposite is true. Between their design, custom ear tips, and silicone stabilizers, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are the most comfortable wireless earbuds I've ever worn.</p><p>The tricky thing about comfort and fit as a feature is that it's different for everyone. I trust the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) to fit for most people's ears, but not all will need the fine-tuned fit and security. Some would be just fine wearing AirPods, Galaxy Buds, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a>. If that's the case for you, snagging a high-end pair of earbuds from Apple, Samsung, or Google might be a better option than paying as much as $100 more for Bose earbuds.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9f37e178-d333-4d23-b7b1-5ff91df7f7d2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YJwSx2qUb66cj6TbCtJWEE.jpg' alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Gen 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The ones to beat</strong></em></p><p>While there are many challengers, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) provide the best mix of comfort, battery life, sound quality, and ANC.

MediaTek is right there.</p><p>Everything I think about the Dimensity 9500 is based on what it does "on paper," just like the flagship Dimensity chips before it, simply because I live in the United States and buy phones designed for the United States. AKA: phones <em>without </em>a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chip inside.</p><p>That makes me sad. Yes, I know I can easily buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-importing-xiaomi-phone-us">Xiaomi phone</a> that uses the chip I want to try, but that's not exactly what I want. I want to try a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11</a>, for example, with one in it so I can see how it compares to the others. Since trying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> and its MediaTek 9300 Plus, I've been itching to try it on a phone that I'm familiar with.</p><p>I had my hopes up at one time for Google to partner with MediaTek (the two companies are very friendly) in the Pixel phones, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-can-a-tech-giant-build-a-smartphone-chip-without-its-own-foundry">designing its own chip</a> is a smarter move, so I won't grumble.</p><p>I simply do not care about how it performs on paper. I do not give a flying, well you know, about benchmarks. I can say anything in a press release and be confident nobody will ever spend the time to prove it's not 100% accurate, and I can make a benchmark app tell you whatever number you want to see with a few minutes in Android Studio. Yeah, I'm saying companies tell little white lies to make their stuff look good. Always have, always will.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.13%;"><img id="8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH" name="MediaTek Dimensity 9500 Infographic" alt="A MediaTek Dimensity 9500 infographic describing key stats about the SoC described throughout the article." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8037" height="5395" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have used plenty of products with a MediaTek chip, including the 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300X</a>.

In short, OnePlus states that it's creating a new, dedicated U.S. account Community, with "tailored services" designed for those users on September 26. If you were once in the U.S. and are no longer there, you may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://accounts.oneplus.com/information/oneplus-oversea-us-server-offline?source=community">change your region</a> to better reflect your current residence.</p><p>Getting into more detail, the post states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/">current global</a> Community forum will "no longer be accessible" to U.S. users on September 26 (EST). The new Community, designed especially for U.S. users, will come with its own app, as well.</p><p>If you've been active, meaning you've been posting content, etc., OnePlus says all of that's going with you. Posts, comments, and your favorites are tied to your account, the company states. It will remain available on the new U.S. Community and the Global sector.</p><p>OnePlus Global's Community team member, Yash Jain, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1953273941623570437?parentCid=1953974542728691720">posted further detail</a>s about this change on the forums. Jain states that this "is not a deprioritization of the U.S. region, in fact, it’s the opposite." OnePlus is pushing that this is a dedicated platform for its U.S. base that "will be distinct, and operated by a new Community Team based in the U.S."</p><h2 id="oneplus-changes-you-2">OnePlus Changes & You</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once again, all these changes are going on September 26.

Instead of spending hundreds on screen replacement, spend ten to fifteen dollars on an excellent screen protector.</p><h2 id="every-inch-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-s-display-needs-a-layer-of-reliable-protection-2">Every inch of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra's display needs a layer of reliable protection</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="d8fafaff-ef91-40ad-bb8a-f894ca31af5c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7TUPohM4p7zUvfdMqDJf8.jpg' alt="Coolpow 2 PACK Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Coolpow 2 PACK Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>The Coolpow 2 PACK Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra gives you two pieces of shatter-proof and case-friendy tempered glass screen protectors with 9H hardness as well as an easy installation frame for just $13.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="c1a2b7e7-6d54-477e-b242-9df5375f5d3b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EKCcYdnJJMvVYp7J7LimiU.jpg' alt="AACL 2 Pack Tempered Glass for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AACL 2 Pack Tempered Glass for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best notch-less</strong></em></p><p>If you want a cutout-free screen guard for your Tab S11 Ultra, the hardy AACL 2 Pack Tempered Glass is right for the job.

First-party options from Samsung are the best of the lot, but they are eye-wateringly expensive, touting exorbitant price tags. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim is wonderfully thin, adding a keyboard to your Tab S11 Ultra along with a stand. However, it costs over $200!</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Smart Book Cover is the other Samsung case for the 14.6-inch tablet. While it costs half as much as the keyboard case and is also incredibly thin and lightweight, the $100 price is still too much for a mere case.</p><p>Spigen brings more affordable offerings to the table with the heavy-duty Rugged Armor Pro and Ultra Hybrid Pro for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. Both cost about $50, add drop protection, come with S Pen holders, and have kickstands. Make a decision based on how light you need your tablet cover to be and what level of drop protection you're aiming for.</p><p>If $50 is still too much for you, there are cheaper options available. You could get an off-brand third-party case like the Ltezixal Case or the INFILAND Case, both of which cost $25 each. These cases fulfil the basic requirements of a Tab S11 Ultra case, such as a folio, impact protection, and a kickstand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The sleek and lightweight Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the iPhone Air's biggest competition, and thanks to Amazon's October Prime Day sale, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5"><strong>buy the phone unlocked today and save a whopping 36%</strong></a> on your purchase.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">early Prime Day discount</a> drops the price of the S25 Edge down to $699.99, which is a full $300 cheaper than the starting price of the iPhone Air. Sure, Apple's release is a tiny bit thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge (5.8mm vs 5.64mm, respectively), but Samsung's phone is 2 grams lighter than its rival. Needless to say, if you want a great deal on a thin phone, I'd recommend that you skip the iPhone Air and live life on the Edge (see what I did there?).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-best-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-deal-on-the-web-2">The best Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge deal on the web</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="62bb2ec8-9feb-46b4-a102-b681159a8509" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.65%;"><img id="DUNzf4idmhXLRyNApWBWZX" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUNzf4idmhXLRyNApWBWZX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="805" height="931" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5" data-dimension112="62bb2ec8-9feb-46b4-a102-b681159a8509" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del><strong> $699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The iPhone Air may be getting all of the attention, but why settle for Apple when you can score a whopping 36% discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>?

Most of our tests show that the Galaxy S25 Edge lasts about 12-15 hours on a single charge, which is considerably less than the majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there.</p><p>If we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">continue to compare</a> the S25 Edge with its iPhone rival, I should also mention that the Samsung phone lacks MagSafe and Qi2 support for convenient charging, although the Edge <em>does </em>have a faster USB-C port to make up for it. Without an accompanying discount, the S25 Edge is also $100 more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>All things said and done, if you're paying full price for a smartphone, the iPhone Air might be the better deal for some folks. But throw on a record-smashing 36% discount and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge becomes an absurdly better value. It might take months for the price of the Apple device to drop this low, so if you want a thin phone today, this choice is easy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means you could keep the editing simple by asking the image editor to "make this image" better, and Gemini will make the necessary adjustments to the image, like adjusting the brightness, contrast, and removing unnecessary noise from the picture, so you don't manually have to.  Or you can take it a step further, imagine your pet or that alpaca from the petting zoo chilling in Hawaii with a mojito—Gemini can make it happen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS" name="2nd In-Line animation" alt="Conversational photo editing in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It makes things extremely easy when it comes to editing photos, since you can basically chat or speak to Gemini to make certain edits for you that seem somewhat of a task, like Magic Eraser; you previously had to manually refine areas that weren't fully erased, but Gemini streamlines this process.</p><p>But now,  with conversational edits, you can just give Gemini a prompt to “remove the cars in the background” or something more general like “restore this old photo,” and Photos will understand the changes you’re trying to make. And the best part is that Gemini gives you multiple edited images to pick from, so you can choose the one that matches your original idea.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fPmijCCrZosdvQ7srXWCec" name="Android_Alpaca+conversational+edit" alt="Google expands conversational edit feature to all Android users" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPmijCCrZosdvQ7srXWCec.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And it doesn't end there; you will also be able to give Gemini multiple edits in one go, like  “remove the reflections and fix the washed-out colors.” The AI bot also gives you several prompt suggestions based on the image you're editing, which helps out if you need a little inspiration. Once Gemini generates the edited image, you can also give it follow-up instructions to "fine-tune" your image as well.</p><p>Lastly, within the image's details, Google will keep things transparent in the picture by indicating that these edits were made using AI tools. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">All eligible Android users in the U.S. </a>can try out this feature starting today.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="405ceccc-781c-4f97-8b06-bd1ccd9fde2b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new standard</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 is one of the smartest phones you can buy thanks to the Tensor G5 chip and new Gemini AI features like Camera Coach and Magic Cue.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It comes with ZAGG's EZ Apply installation tray, is made of highly durable Glass Elite tempered glass that's five times stronger than the industry standard, and has an oil-repelling layer on top. The edges of the Glass Elite Tablet Screen Protector are reinforced to prevent cracks from spreading, even if they do occur. The only problem with this kit is the $50 price tag.</p><p>So if you're on the hunt for something cheaper, the SPARIN 2 Pack Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 costs just $10 but includes two pieces of tempered glass screen protectors. It doesn't include an installation tray, but you can buy the one from JETech if that's a deal-breaker for you.</p><p>If you're not sold on glossy glass finishes, the Supershieldz 3 Pack Anti-Glare Matte Screen Protector and MoKo 2 Pack Paperfeel Screen Protector are both excellent choices. Both sets offer matte PET films at reasonable prices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>Meta is continuing to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review#section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-specs-and-how-they-work">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2.</p><p>For those with advanced prescription needs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">there are third-party workarounds available</a>.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-design-and-specs-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Design and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-Black-glasses-on-display" alt="Black Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses sitting on a metal display shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content.</p><p>The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model.</p><p>I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1200p at 60FPS</p><p>1440p at 30FPS</p><p>3K at 30FPS</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>52g</p></td><td  ><p>49.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td><td  ><p>4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>48 hours worth of charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos.

You get 1200p at 60FPS, 1440p at 30FPS, and 3K at 30FPS video recording on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, and that exceeds the 1080p maximum on the Gen 1 glasses.</p><p>It's the same 3K camera we saw on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review#section-oakley-meta-hstn-specs">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, which should bring more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">advanced stabilization while recording video</a>, particularly handy for action shots.

Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses.</p><p>In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch.</p><p>You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI is becoming more robust</a>, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs.

The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get.</p><p>You should consider whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Display</a>, Oakley Meta HSTN, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses.</p><p>However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them.

It’s now a place to discover entertainment and seasonal content without digging. Google has been testing this idea — like India’s Cricket Hub and Japan’s Comics space — and is rolling it out globally.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Play Store</a> in Korea now has a dedicated entertainment corner loaded with mobile-friendly dramas, movies, and TV shows, while U.S. users can browse trending shows, webcomics, and bite-sized dramas right from the Apps tab.\</p><p>Seasonal spotlights will pop up in an immersive format tailored to your tastes.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/42390-nothing-phone-3-nothing-os-v35-250911-2112-changelog" target="_blank">new build</a>, tagged Nothing OS V3.5-250911-2112, is now hitting devices and packs a much-needed camera overhaul plus a handful of stability fixes and tweaks that should make day-to-day use feel smoother.</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and Nothing OS 4.0 are still on the horizon, this update keeps the Phone 3 sharp in the meantime. The camera is where you’ll notice the biggest difference (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/22/nothing-phone-3-update-delivers-camera-improvements-ahead-of-android-16/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This update gives you finer control over the camera's manual exposure, making adjustments more precise and responsive. It also tackles a known issue with color casts, so your photos now show truer, more balanced colors in any light.</p><p>AI SuperRes Zoom now makes zoomed-in text look crisper, and Action Mode cuts down noise and grain for cleaner motion shots. Even third-party camera apps are getting clearer results now. On the video side, contrast has been boosted, haze reduced, and colors look livelier, so clips should pop more on playback.</p><h2 id="under-the-hood-fixes-2">Under-the-hood fixes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing didn’t stop at camera polish. The update fixes a few annoying bugs and smooths out some rough edges across the interface.</p><p>The Glyph Matrix feature works better when you’re using multi-user mode alongside Always-on Glyph Toys, and a pesky bug that duplicated contact avatars when setting new Essential Notification rules has been squashed.</p><p>Haptic feedback is back to normal when previewing Generative notifications, and alignment issues with Arabic titles in the “About phone” section have been corrected. There’s also a cleaner interface for Bluetooth device recording tucked under Settings → Sound & Vibration → Bluetooth device recording.</p><p>On top of that, the update reduces heating and battery drain in certain scenarios, while Wi-Fi connectivity and overall network stability have been optimized.</p><p>Even though this build is still based on Android 15, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-0-revealed">recently teased its next big step</a>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-teases-refined-and-redefined-os-4-0-thats-coming-soon">Nothing OS 4.0 based on Android 16</a>. The update roadmap confirms that alongside the Phone 3, devices like the Phone 3a series, Phone 2 models, and CMF Phones will all get the upgrade.</p><p>For now, though, Phone 3 owners should head to Settings → Software Update and grab this release. Between the camera upgrades, performance fixes, and improved connectivity, it’s a worthwhile refresh ahead of the bigger changes to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The OpenFit 2 Plus brings back these same perks, largely unchanged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds, one facing the camera showing the logo and top button/speaker grill, the other laying on its back showing the main speaker grill, mic hole, and ear hook." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, however, the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus has enabled a Dolby Audio mode, in addition to the current options like bass boost. This mode cuts the battery life down from 11 hours to 9 hours, but in exchange, you get richer, more cinematic audio, best suited for streaming movies or shows but also improving your workout playlists.</p><p>While we've yet to test the Dolby Audio mode, our friends at Techradar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-headphones/i-went-for-a-run-with-the-all-new-shokz-openfit-2-and-theyre-already-threatening-to-become-my-go-to-running-headphones">reviewed the OpenFit 2+</a> and said that "everything becomes richer and more pronounced" with it toggled on, making the OpenFit 2 feel "obsolete" by comparison. We were impressed by the OpenFit 2's audio quality, which makes us excited to try this new mode.</p><p>In addition, the OpenFit 2 Plus comes with a Qi-compatible charging case, so you can leave your OpenFit 2s on a compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless charger</a> to refill its 48 hours of total capacity between workouts. USB-C charging currently refills the case and earbuds in about 100 minutes, but Shokz hasn't confirmed how long Qi charging will take.</p><p>Many recent wireless workout earbuds, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> and AirPods Pro 3, are using your ear canals to measure heart rate. It'll be interesting to see if this approach resonates with athletes, or if they'll prefer an option that leaves their ear canals open but still delivers Dolby-level sound.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus is available in Black, Grey, and Stone Blue through most retailers; limited-edition HYROX earbuds with a black and gold finish are only available through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openfit2plus">Shokz's site</a>, as part of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shokz-joins-hyrox-as-the-official-headphone-partner-of-hyrox-north-america-to-support-everyday-athletes-nationwide-302555665.html">official partnership</a> with the race series.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3a5c4ade-7f18-44b1-a5b1-524d76ff0cc2">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-Open-Ear-Headphones-Comfortable-Water-Resistant/dp/B0DYCJSZLS/" data-model-name="Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj8keyq5rW7qcvXmjNbzM6.png' alt="Render of the black Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus wireless earbuds and case"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2+ offer a unique alternative to bone conduction headphones, with rich, targeted audio, comfortably secure earhooks, dependable battery life, decent water resistance, and multipoint pairing to sync with both your phone and laptop. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

To begin working on this new network, Verizon has also partnered with some of the big OEMs in tech, including Sony Ericsson, Samsung, and Nokia, along with device and chipset innovators Meta and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.</p><p>In its press release, the company stated that this forum's aim is to look for the network's potential uses, and with the help of the above companies, Verizon would be able to create foundational technologies that align with global needs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KujEDUnyaHJxPnMm35Zt2G" name="samsung-galaxy-s21-verizon-5g-wide2.jpg" alt="Galaxy S21 connected to Verizon 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KujEDUnyaHJxPnMm35Zt2G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Hayato Huseman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While people are still getting used to 5G's speed in many ways, the press release noted that, “5G Advanced lays the foundation for the 6G future - whether that's new wearables, AI experiences, or entirely new use cases we haven’t even thought of yet, and that’s what excites me the most," said aid Joe Russo, EVP & president, global networks and technology at Verizon.</p><p>And like any next-gen network, 6G is definitely going to be much faster than 5G, but this network will focus on more than just speed. Russo adds that the network is designed for the next era, implying this could basically back powerful AI /native devices that have already started transforming the way we function.</p><p>"Verizon's networks form the backbone of the emerging Artificial Intelligence economy, delivering the infrastructure and expertise essential for businesses to fully harness AI's potential," the press release added.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-store-with-6g-2">What's in store with 6G</h2><p>That said, the company also confirms that they're moving beyond just theoretical discussions and moving to tangible goals like testing the full potential of 6G on new spectrum bands and bandwidths.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/business/networks/solutions/6g/">Samsung explains</a> in its post that, with 6G, the industry aims to reach a peak data rate of 1,000Gbps and, on average, user-experienced data rates of 1Gbps. Additionally, 6G is said to provide super low latency, meaning the time it takes for a signal to travel is expected to be reduced to microseconds, approximately a 1,000-fold improvement over 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH" name="6G- samsung-plans" alt="Samsung lays out what's in store with 6G connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/6g/6g-explained/#:~:text=A%20network%20that%20can%20sense,the%20environment%2C%20people%20and%20objects.">Nokia states</a> that the new network will have the ability to "sense" the environment by using signals that will essentially bounce off obstacles or objects that come in its path. This will allow it to figure out what those objects are, where they are, how fast they're moving, and what they're made of.</p><p>By combining this information with AI, the network can create a "digital twin" of the physical world. This will allow companies to create a map that will provide 6G signals to the user faster.</p><p>Finally, Verizon is also working with organizations like 3GPP, so that their research in 6G aligns with network standards worldwide. "This helps create a unified 6G network that everyone can use, no matter who made their device or where they are," it added.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the recently reported One UI 8.5 test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about these two alleged earbuds. Code suggests there is a base model and a Pro with model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>The post states these names were discovered from strings in Samsung's test server code, so there isn't much else about them. While one would love to hear any supposed specs or features, there are none at the moment until development likely progresses.</p><p>However, the publication spotted another mention of Samsung's next-gen buds from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>.

A tipster spotted the build on the company's test server, stating Samsung started development using the Galaxy S25 series. Three version numbers were spotted, supposedly linking to the three models for the series this year. At the time, what the test version contained was unclear (like the possibility of a public beta); however, one interesting feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">has since come to light</a>.</p><p>It's now rumored that Samsung is working on a privacy feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra that could block out prying eyes.

This change in the camera array and design could be due to OnePlus's departure from Hasselblad for its new DetailMax Engine to deliver "clarity and authenticity."</p><p>If these rumors hold true, then the new camera placement really messes with the OnePlus' unique look, making it look a lot like a Pixel or even the  iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>That said, the phone is expected to show up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15s-color-lineup-may-omit-a-long-standing-favorite-as-it-gains-a-165hz-refresh-rate">three colors</a>: Absolute Black, Mist Purple, and Sand Dune.

To get us going, Google states this major update is rolling out for viewers with a TCL QM9K series device. Consumers with the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models will have to wait until "later this year."</p><p>This major Gemini for Google TV is calling the old (and still existing) Assistant old news, as the post states the newer AI model "goes beyond simple commands." Users can talk to Gemini with natural speech, as you would to a person sitting beside you. Saying "Hey Google" (or by pressing the mic button on your remote) will let you experience a new world of AI-assisted TV, such as when you're unsure about what to watch.</p><p>Google says users can ask Gemini to suggest some movies when it's hard to find something that two people with varying tastes may enjoy. If you like dramas, but your partner likes comedies, you can tell Gemini those interests and see what it finds.</p><p>Gemini can also get you "caught up" if you missed a season of a popular show, and it can even turn your "vague" show descriptions into something you can work with.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-asking-question-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a floating bar of text with a user's voice prompt in it, asking for the AI to explain a recent show's season for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-educational-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a text-based explainer for a child about "why volcanoes erupt," as well as offering a row of YouTube videos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini for Google TV is reportedly leaning into its educational abilities in this new update, and it's bringing YouTube with it. The company states that parents can ask Gemini to "explain" or expand on certain real-world phenomena. To explain, the post highlights that Gemini will deliver a text-based explainer, alongside a row of recommended YouTube videos to further the subject.</p><p>Moreover, Google teases that Gemini can also help you with tutorials and cooking ideas right from your TV.</p><p>As previously stated, Gemini for Google TV is rolling out today (Sep 22) for consumers with a TCL QM9K series device. The post alludes to there being even more Gemini capabilities "coming soon." We'll have to see if these additional features coincide with Gemini's release on more devices later in 2025.</p><h2 id="there-s-even-more-from-google-tv-on-the-way-2">There's even more from Google TV on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-free-live-tv-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Free Live TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We were hearing about this Gemini update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tvs-gemini-upgrade-promises-smarter-and-more-enjoyable-viewing-experience">Google TV during CES 2025</a>, which is when the company said you could just "speak naturally to your TV." That idea was stated alongside the idea that users wouldn't need to say "Hey Google." However, with today's update, we're seeing that the wake-up prompt is still there, but users can also press their microphone button and begin speaking.</p><p>Google stated that Gemini on Google TV would connect with a homeowner's smart devices, allowing the choice of checking in on doorbell cameras and more. This pretty much sounds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque update</a> we got a few months prior to CES 2025.</p><p>Google's current teaser of more Gemini features to come with its Google TV introduction was echoed in January. The company said that by the end of 2025, Google TV will feature proximity sensors that react to your presence, which could kick off a photo slideshow and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's an achievement in and of itself considering the sheer number of products in this category, and Bose deserves credit for delivering a good fit and incredible sound quality.</p><p>The brand is following that up with the introduction of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2; these earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Immersive/dp/B0F7M1JXVV">cost the same $299 on Amazon</a> as their predecessor, and they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-2nd-gen-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earbuds-black/J7C5V6WCKZ">available at Best Buy</a> as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen/QCUE2-HEADPHONEIN.html?srsltid=AfmBOortI8aUFquTrhfiDV9L3mzSD9dxBMiRSITQy196N4FreLJJJGSD">Bose's own site</a>. The design is thankfully unchanged, with Bose retaining the same aesthetic and build quality.</p><p>If anything, the biggest change this time has to do with the case; it has the same design as last time, but it now includes wireless charging as standard. This was a notable omission with the earlier model, and it's good to see Bose make amends. I was able to easily charge the case by plonking it down on the Qi 2 mat of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Baseus Nomos charging station</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5025" height="2830" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having used the QuietComfort Ultra extensively, the Gen 2 buds are immediately familiar. Bose sells the buds in four color choices — Black, White Smoke, Deep Plum, and Midnight Violet — and I'd suggest getting the violet model if you want a vibrant hue. I've got the White Smoke edition, and while the color is fine, it doesn't exactly stand out all that much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fit is identical to its predecessor, and the stabilizers that sit outside the shell ensure you get a tight seal while still being comfortable. Although these buds look a little bigger than their rivals, there are absolutely no issues with comfort, and the sound nozzle doesn't extend too much into the inner ear. You get a good range of accessories to tailor the fit, and there's no fatigue even with long-term use. In short, they're among the most comfortable earbuds around today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bundled ear tips include a filter by default, doing a better job protecting the shell. The fit is secure enough that there are no problems wearing these during workouts; on that note, you get IPX4 ingress protection, making the buds immune to sweat.

Huawei still makes great products even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huaweis-harmony-os-just-android-hat-and-sunglasses">without being officially Android-based</a>. While the U.S. ban financially hurt them, the company should be around for a while, as it's very popular in China and other places.</p><p>A quick answer is to never say never, but I can't see Huawei's ban being lifted any time soon, and without a major shift in what all the company manufacturers. The ban wasn't about phones or protecting consumers from Huawei's products; it was all about money and market "power".</p><h2 id="why-did-huawei-get-banned-2">Why did Huawei get banned?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Officially, Huawei was found to be working with the Chinese state and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/commerce-department-will-allow-us-companies-do-business-huawei">security threat to the United States</a>. Without knowing everything that was found and investigated, it's impossible to know how much of that is true, but it doesn't really matter because U.S. interests (public <em>and</em> private) would have just found another reason. Huawei needed to leave the market, and the faster the better.</p><p>It's about those little symbols at the top of your phone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">5G</a>.

I mean "heavy" network gear and switches that telecom companies need. In particular, Huawei was able to make network equipment that worked as well as anyone else could build and sell it cheaper. When that happened, companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/at-t-may-phase-out-huawei-equipment-network-upgrades-mexico#:~:text=AT&T%20will%20likely%20phase%20out,their%20networks%20outside%20the%20U.S." target="_blank">AT&T</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/ceo-hans-vestberg-says-verizon-does-not-use-any-huawei-equipment.html#:~:text=Verizon%20CEO:%20We're%20doing%20just%20fine%20without,from%20the%20Chinese%20trade%20war%2C%22%20says%20Vestberg" target="_blank">Verizon</a>, as well as more industrial companies we've never heard of, started to buy it.</p><p>The U.S. is weird when it comes to a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">monopoly</a>" in the market. Some politicians think one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/house-democrats-say-tech-companies-have-monopoly-needs-broken">should never exist,</a> some think only the companies they like should be able to dominate a market, but almost all of them feel that if there is going to be one, it can't be a company from China or with ties to the Chinese government.</p><p>Huawei is both, and the fears that it was state-sponsored before the ban may or may not have been true, but they are now. The very same thing would happen here in the U.S. if China banned a company with a high market share: the government would do whatever it takes to save it.</p><p>You can still buy a Huawei product in the U.S. from a reseller, but the hardware and the software are not going to work as designed, there will be no warranty, and it might not work at all.

If Huawei ever wanted to do business here or with American companies without restrictions, a lot would have to change.</p><p>I don't think Huawei would be willing (or should be willing) to step backwards so it can sell more phones in the land of rampant consumerism. It should continue to build out a portfolio of products, services, and mobile offerings without caring what the U.S. government thinks about it. With the company further entrenched with the Chinese government and having expanded into the field of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/huawei-shows-off-ai-computing-system-rival-nvidias-top-product-2025-07-26/">AI hardware</a>, technology, and research, everything the "right" people did not like about Huawei is now even "worse" than it was when the ban was placed.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the company striving to be an example of Chinese national pride, the same way Ford or General Motors once was in the U.S. Of course, I'm not privy to any information that would prove me wrong and have no say in the matter, so I'm going with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The chief executive officer at Oura, Tom Hale, states, "ŌURA has sold over 2.5 million rings since June 2024, reaching in just over a year what previously took the company eleven years to achieve since its founding in 2013."</p><p>Hale adds that the achievement is a "testament" to the "incredible demand" for its smart rings.</p><p>The post highlights that the Oura Ring is available in over 150 countries. Moreover, it reiterates the company's presence on Amazon, which consumers found welcoming, as Business Wire states, Oura became the fastest-growing brand on the platform.</p><p>Aside from this, Oura states that its sales performance has doubled, which seemingly goes hand-in-hand with its newest units sold. The post states that Oura has passed over $500 million of earned revenue in 2024, and is reportedly on track to surpass $1 billion by the end of 2025.</p><h2 id="oura-made-some-moves-and-continued-its-health-focus-2">Oura made some moves, and continued its health focus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-04" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus revealing scratches on the back with the Oura Ring 4 top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The press release's mention of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-retail-amazon-samsung-competition">Oura's smart rings on Amazon</a> takes us back to 2024 when the announcement first occurred. A range of its devices was posted on Amazon's marketplace as Oura sought to get ahead of its expected competition: Samsung. Oura saw this shift as a way to expand its retail presence and reach even more consumers.</p><p>While this came at a time when the world was expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-expanding-the-galaxy-ring-in-five-important-new-ways">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>, Oura's chief marketing officer, Doug Sweeny, said new competition was a "positive thing." Sweeny added that Samsung's (then-pending) introduction into smart rings gave Oura "validation" in what they were doing. We've since seen how that "validation" has become a real positive for Oura over this past year.</p><p>Recently, the smart ring company has continued to focus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-ring-pregnancy-insights-perimenopause-features">on moms and premenopausal women</a>. The latter arrived as a new "Perimenopause Check-In" for women to track their symptoms and receive personalized health reports. For mothers, Oura added Pregnancy Insights to its app, and it now offers guidance for expectant mothers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Our testing showed that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 typically lasts around 20 hours with normal use.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 also ditches S Pen support in favor of the thin profile, and you're only getting IP48 water and dust resistance. These are minor issues that may feel a bit nitpicky, but there are many folks who understandably might want more from a $2,000 phone.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard that Samsung was increasing the starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to $1,999.99, I had my doubts that anyone would be interested in paying such a premium. Clearly I was wrong, but if you (like me) were waiting for the right Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal to come along, now's your chance to grab the top-rated foldable at a much more reasonable price. </p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want a keyboard case, nothing works better than the Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover Keyboard Slim. However, it's also eye-wateringly expensive, priced at an ungodly $145. And if you skip the keyboard to cut costs, the basic Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover isn't any better. Without a keyboard, you'd still pay a whopping $90 for a mere tablet cover with a folio and stand.</p><p>Of course, Samsung's own cases work like a dream, hugging the Tab S11 in all the right places. However, at those prices, you're better off getting dupes that function almost as well as the first-party ones. Alternatively, you can turn to reliable name brands such as Spigen to get quality you can depend on. The Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S11 is rugged, affordable, and practical. With raised edges and several layers of material added to it for better drop-proofing, it is somewhat bulky, but you get ease of mind in exchange. The Spigen case also has a kickstand and an S Pen storage compartment.</p><p>If it's dupes you're interested in, the Doohoeek Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a cost effective keyboard case for the Tab S11. It has a backlit keyboard, scissor-switch keys, a low profile, a kickstand, and even an S Pen slot. If you want to go even cheaper, the HUKWIMO Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a budget-friendly buy without a keyboard. It imitates the three-fold design of the first-party Tab S11 Book Cover, so you can fold the cover to convert it into a stand in three different ways.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This potential feature is presumably designed to limit how much of your screen can be seen from side angles.</p><p>The idea is simple but smart: if you’re on a bus or standing in a crowded line, the person next to you shouldn’t get an eyeful of your banking details or private chats.</p><p>According to the leaked code strings, Private Display isn’t just a manual toggle. Samsung is baking in some intelligence here. The feature can reportedly kick in automatically when you’re using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place.</p><p>There also seem to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control. Users might even be able to pick specific apps to trigger the feature or schedule when it turns on.</p><h2 id="new-hardware-needed-2">New hardware needed</h2><p>What makes this particularly exciting is that it likely ties into new hardware. Samsung’s display division has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank">been developing “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a>, an AI-driven pixel adjustment that changes viewing angles. However, this tech is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1957681630509953114" target="_blank">rumored</a> to be compatible only with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and probably future Ultra models.</p><p>That means Private Display won’t be coming to every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. Without the right panel tech, older models probably won’t be able to pull this off.</p><p>Timing-wise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> has already started rolling out to some devices, but One UI 8.5 is expected to make its official debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series in early 2026. Samsung could still tweak or delay some parts of Private Display before launch, but what’s already been uncovered shows a lot of promise.</p><p>Instead of forcing users to rely on clunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party screen protectors</a>, Samsung looks ready to build smarter, more seamless privacy directly into its hardware and software. For anyone who hates shoulder surfers, this should be a meaningful upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">rolling out its Teen Accounts protections in the U.S. earlier this year</a>, the company is now expanding its test to Canada.</p><p>The new settings are designed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-stricter-messaging-settings-instgram-facebook">limit interactions with unwanted accounts</a> and filter inappropriate content. So, even if someone lists an adult birthday but seems under 18, Instagram’s AI will automatically switch them into Teen Account settings.</p><p>Those settings restrict who can contact them and filter out inappropriate content. The company is quick to acknowledge that its AI isn't perfect. If the system makes a mistake and flags an actual adult, that user will have the option to easily revert their settings and correct their age, but the goal is to keep most under-18s in a safer digital space by default.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.69%;"><img id="bGum5FJod4Nab3LgWdPe4J" name="Instagram-teen-accounts-settings" alt="Teen Accounts settings on Instagram" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGum5FJod4Nab3LgWdPe4J.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="parents-are-getting-a-nudge-too-2">Parents are getting a nudge, too</h2><p>The move isn’t just about algorithms. Parents are getting pulled in, too. Starting today, Instagram will send notifications to parents in Canada with conversation tips, developed with pediatric psychologist Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, on how to talk with their teens about using their real birthdays online.</p><p>Instagram's message is clear: if teens list the right ages, the system can protect them better.</p><p>The company says more than 54 million teens worldwide are already in Teen Accounts, and 97% of 13 to 15-year-olds have kept the protections on. Over 90% of surveyed parents think the safeguards help, but many still feel overwhelmed by managing their kids’ online lives. By nudging parents directly and backing them up with AI, Instagram is hoping to close the gap.</p><p>The platform admits age verification online is still an industry-wide headache. Even with AI and parental involvement, misrepresentation happens. Still, by linking parental approval and app store age checks with its own tech, Instagram is trying to make it harder for underage users to slip through the cracks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We got to go hands-on with all of them, and I've used several pairs since 2021.</p><p>Despite coming out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, Meta isn't sunsetting the Gen 1s at all. In fact, the company is keeping them around as the most affordable entry in the lineup, with the price scaling up from there. In total, Meta has half a dozen different smart glasses to choose from.</p><p>So which pair of Meta smart glasses is right for you? They all have Meta AI at their core and can take pictures, record video, and mirror earbud functionality when paired with any phone, but is the least expensive pair your best bet? Or should you get something a little more premium? I answer all those questions and more below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-1"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC" name="Ray-Ban-Stories-2023-recording-LED-02.jpg" alt="The status LED on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite what the name says, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) is actually the second-generation Ray-Ban smart glasses product. The original was called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> and debuted in September 2021, but the rebrand to Ray-Ban Meta for the second product was for a big reason. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was a superb upgrade, offering Meta AI capabilities, significantly better video and picture quality, surround sound audio recording and playback, and better battery life.</p><p>Despite Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) being the cheapest of the bunch, they're still a wonderful pair of smart glasses that I think most people will be happy with. They come in three classic Ray-Ban styles — Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler — each with a wide selection of lens colors and tints. And yes, you can even get prescription lenses from -6.00 to +4.00.</p><p>But Meta doesn't seem to be stocking all available lens colors for the Gen 1s anymore. As of this writing, Meta only offers Wayfarer and Skyler on its website, and Best Buy has a very limited selection, as well.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, 3 colors per style.

This means you'll need to ask questions one at a time, while newer Meta glasses support Meta AI live conversation mode.</p><p>The Gen 1's camera quality is also almost as good as the Gen 2's, despite the gulf in resolution offered in recording quality. Pictures are largely identical between generations, but video quality is significantly better on Gen 2s. Gen 1 also has worse video stabilization.</p><p>Battery life is the weakest part of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1). At just 4 hours of maximum battery life per charge, you'll be used to charging these glasses at least once per day. Thankfully, the included charging case makes it easy to top them up on the go, and you'll be able to charge the glasses fully several times over before needing to recharge the case.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d59d18c0-33e3-457a-955e-c4cd86282e55">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtHvnQ6maDDrxzE4uEUDng.jpg' alt="Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses official product renders"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Style on a budget</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) packs in excellent speakers and mics, classic Ray-Ban styles, respectably high-res photos, compatibility with Facebook and Instagram for quick sharing, and other perks that make them among the best smart glasses available.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-2"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the most stylish pair of smart glasses Meta offers today.

Up until now, Meta's glasses were iterations of one another, but Vanguard is where the experience forks a bit. These glasses are made for athletes who plan to record their activities with a more convenient hands-free camera instead of strapping a GoPro to a helmet.</p><p>As such, they have a limited number of style options, don't support prescription lenses, and only come with Oakley PRIZM lenses. You can easily swap out lens colors if you want to buy additional ones, but there's no support for Transitions, polarized, solid color, or clear lenses at this time.</p><p>But what they lack in style, they more than make up for in capability. Oakley Meta Vanguard are the first Meta smart glasses that tie directly into Garmin and Strava, automatically matching up recorded videos with fitness data from these services. You'll even find an overlay with this data on recorded videos, which is pretty darn slick!</p><div ><table><caption>Oakley Meta Vanguard</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>White or black frames, 4 lens colors, one size.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lens options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐</p></td><td  ><p>PRIZM (non-polarized)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 9 hours per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, 1080p/60FPS or 3K/30FPS video.

Meta says they're good for listening to in up to 30MPH winds, so you can jam to tunes while you fly down the slopes. They're also the <strong>only</strong> Meta smart glasses with an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, making them perfect for some watersports.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard has the longest battery life of any Meta smart glasses, but you can't use that extra battery to livestream your tricks to the world.

This simple gadget tracked steps and sleep, and even had a vibration motor inside to alert you to phone notifications. Since then, Amazfit has morphed into a fitness powerhouse, offering dozens of different smartwatches at every price level and functionality you could dream of.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions">Amazfit Balance 2</a> is my favorite smartwatch from the company in a long time, and its impressive capabilities are only matched by its sleek appearance. Of course, my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> is still cranking right along, good as the day it came out, and is, quite frankly, hard to beat for most fitness-related tasks.</p><p>I wore both of these watches on my latest Spartan Race and had a difficult time finding any reasonable differences in the data they provided at the end of the race. Which leads me to wonder: why would I pay more for a Garmin than an Amazfit watch? I found a few reasons, and they might help you decide.</p><h2 id="price-2">Price</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg" name="amazfit-balance-2-and-t-rex-3-pro" alt="Holding an Amazfit Balance 2 and Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Price is the area where Amazfit wins most handily. Garmin is known for producing high-quality watches that aren't inexpensive, which has given the brand a premium image over the years. Amazfit started from the other end of things, offering dirt-cheap products and upping their game over time (but still undercutting rivals on price).</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-vs-garmin-vivosmart-5">Amazfit Band 7 vs the Garmin Vivosmart 5</a>, for instance. Both of these are the latest fitness bands with displays from each respective company; yet, Garmin's is still three times the price of Amazfit's. Plus, because of software updates and a fresh Zepp app, some of the shortcomings we found in our original Amazfit Band 7 review have been rectified.</p><p>This same argument can be made for many of Amazfit's products. In many cases, competing Amazfit products offer 90-95% of the features of Garmin's at something like half the price, and that's a ratio I'm willing to work with.</p><h2 id="fitness-tracking-2">Fitness tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5" name="amazfit-balance-2-garmin-instinct-2x-solar-spartan-race" alt="Wearing an Amazfit Balance 2 and a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar smartwatch at a Spartan Race" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Amazfit watches felt like an obvious second-rate choice for fitness tracking. While they have offered more options for workout types — 180 on the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro I just got versus around 90 on the Garmin Instinct 2X I have — I wasn't convinced of the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring until this year's products.</p><p>Both the Amazfit Balance 2 and T-Rex 3 Pro have superb heart rate accuracy, matching all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a> I've tested to date. I've taken these watches out for paddleboarding sessions, run a Spartan Race with them, and spent plenty of time in my CrossFit-style gym trying out everything from cardio days to strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD" name="Garmin-marathon-training-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on the author's wrist, showing the Primary Race widget with the Garmin Tucson Marathon time, date, weeks until the event, and goal time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only area I found where Garmin more consistently has the edge over Amazfit is during strength training and weight-lifting exercises. While several Amazfit workout types will give you a breakdown of what muscles you used and keep track of your reps, Garmin more consistently shows the correct workout type automatically.</p><p>For instance, my most common workout type is HIIT since it most closely aligns with my gym's typical activity types. If I look at the data from my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, it's got muscle heatmaps of what it thinks I used, which is helpful for going back and remembering why my shoulders are suddenly sore two days later.</p><p>Amazfit only offers this kind of muscular heatmap for strength training or weightlifting exercise types. I've also found that Amazfit's watches have a harder time differentiating nuanced workouts than Garmin. If I select strength training and do a bunch of front squats with a barbell, Garmin almost always marks it as "barbell squat," while Amazfit's watches might figure that out 30% of the time.</p><h2 id="companion-apps-and-syncing-2">Companion apps and syncing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao" name="garmin-connect-spartan-race-map" alt="A map of a Spartan Race workout in the Garmin Connect app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get a little mixed. As an app, Amazfit Zepp is superior. It's got a better, less convoluted UI when compared to the Garmin Connect app, and it offers a ton of additional features that Garmin just doesn't have. LLM-powered food logging is probably the greatest single feature I've used in <em>any</em> holistic workout app, and it's something only Zepp has.</p><p>But as good as the Zepp app's features and UI are, it's held back by a number of bugs that are just plain frustrating. Reddit users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazfit/comments/1khsh4r/amazfit_trex_3_and_active_2_serious_bugs_still/">have complained</a> about this many times, and it often takes Amazfit a long time to address these problems. Coding and workout algorithms are hard, no doubt, but it seems like Amazfit's team isn't able to crank out fixes as fast as some other companies.</p><p>I don't often run into problems with the app, but my original intent for this week's column was to compare data from the Spartan Race I just ran. The problem is, the Amazfit watch had my entire workout on it, but the Zepp app simply wouldn't sync the entire thing.</p><p>This left me with missing workout data when I exported the workout to quantified-self.io, the service we typically use to directly compare smartwatch fitness data. Unfortunately for my original idea, the entire stack of GPS data was missing, and the Zepp app confirmed that.</p><h2 id="holding-amazfit-back-2">Holding Amazfit back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-02" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that there's no way to manually sync fitness data from Amazfit watches or even export from the watch itself. The Zepp app normally automatically syncs all data from your watch at the end of a workout. When this fails, there seems to be no real way to resync.</p><p>Amazfit's support will tell you to force stop the app, reinstall it, clear the cache, etc. But none of these options forces a total resync, even though I can still view all the data on my watch.</p><p>It's these little annoyances (that are sometimes big problems) that Amazfit needs to fix and, ultimately, what holds it back from beating Garmin once and for all.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Does the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 support 5G connectivity?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Best answer:</strong> Technically, yes. When Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab S11, it confirmed the flagship supports 5G, but only sub-6 networks, and there is no support for mmWave 5G networks. You'll of course need a carrier connection and plan to use it. It's also worth noting that while Samsung says the Tab S11 supports 5G, there's currently no 5G variant available for purchase in the U.S., though it is offered in other global markets.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s-5g-connectivity-2">Everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Tab S11's 5G connectivity</h2><p>Like clockwork, Samsung has unveiled its next generation of flagship Android tablets. At this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a>, the company introduced the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This time, Samsung has dropped the Plus model in favor of the standard 11-inch Tab S11. The new Galaxy Tab S11 lineup brings thinner builds, upgraded internals, and One UI 8 (based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box.</p><p>Similar to last year's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra, Samsung has kept 5G connectivity in the Tab S11 series. Both Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra are available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + 5G variants globally. This means you can use Wi-Fi for streaming, downloading apps, and gaming, or get the 5G variant to stay connected on the go without relying on a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Of course, to enjoy 5G on the go, you'll need a separate line or connection for the tablet. Samsung notes that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support physical SIM cards — unlike some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 that have gone eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. Optionally, you can also configure an eSIM alongside a physical SIM.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for 5G support, the Galaxy Tab S11 does support 5G out of the box, giving you fast speeds for streaming and downloads. However, Samsung specifies that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support only sub-6 5G networks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-sub-6-better-mmwave-immediate-5g-future">Sub-6 5G</a> means the Tab S11 can connect to networks below 6GHz, offering wider coverage and better penetration. However, speeds are lower than mmWave 5G. It's worth noting that last year's Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">Tab S10+ offered mmWave 5G</a> support, but this year, Samsung has kept it consistent across the board, with both Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra only offering Sub-6 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another thing to note here is that while Samsung says the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support 5G globally, as of writing, 5G models do not appear to be available for direct purchase on Samsung's USA website. For now, only Wi-Fi models are available in the U.S., with no official word on whether Samsung plans to bring the 5G models to the States.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you don't wish to spend extra to get 5G or if it's not available in your region, you can always use Wi-Fi to get Internet access on your tablet, whether that's using your home's Wi-Fi network or converting your smartphone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 FE</a> or OnePlus 13R, into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-wi-fi-hotspot-android-phone">portable hotspot</a>.

In terms of dimensions, the S25 FE is a tad narrower and shorter, although both phones share 6.7-inch displays. Still, because of the small dimensional discrepancies, it is recommended that you don't apply an S24 FE screen guard on your S25 FE and get a dedicated one instead.</p><p>There are plenty of fantastic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-galaxy-s25-fe">Galaxy S25 FE</a> screen protectors available.

Tempered glass with 9H hardness is the industry standard. Meanwhile, plastic can be TPU, PET, or even hybrid in nature. None of them is right or wrong; it just depends on your usage.</p><p>For most people, the best Samsung Galaxy S25 FE screen protector is one made of tempered glass. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE Screen Protector 2 Pack is the best overall pick for anyone. This kit includes two pieces of hardy 9H tempered glass screen protectors and camera lens protectors. The lens protectors are made of the same durable glass, but they are dark, which might put some folks off. This set also includes a highly convenient alignment frame that reduces the installation time to barely a minute or two.</p><p>If you want a screen protector set that comes with a clear camera lens protector, the firtstnow 3 Pack Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is better suited for you. While it's not as highly reputed as amFilm, it does have outstanding reviews online. You get three 9H tempered glass screen and lens protectors each. However, there's no installation frame in the box.</p><p>After you're done shopping for shatter-proof and scratch-resistant screen protectors, be sure to grab a shock-, impact-, and drop-resistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cases">phone case for your Galaxy S25 FE</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A decent magnetic grip can easily prevent falls and relieve your fingers of repeated stress from holding your phone too long and too frequently. The best part of a magnetic grip is that there's no sticky adhesive — you can pop the grip on and off at any given time.</p><p>The Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand is the best official Pixelsnap-certified accessory for the Pixel 10. It's affordable, functional, and lightweight. You don't need much from a ring holder for your phone to begin with. It's meant to act as a grip and a stand, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand does both well. If you prefer a more traditional circular phone grip, the PopSockets MagSafe PopGrip in Enamel is a great alternative.</p><p>After you've chosen a decent magnetic phone grip, the next Qi2 accessory to look for is a wireless charger. The Anker MagGo 15W Qi2 Wireless Charger (2-in-1 Stand) also doubles as a phone holder that has a magnetic mount with highly adjustable tilting. You can wirelessly charge your Pixel 10 and prop it up at a comfortable viewing angle at the same time. It's priced very reasonably, too.</p><h2 id="convert-your-pixel-10-into-a-mobile-photography-or-videography-rig-2">Convert your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-qi2-kraftgeek-justtap-powershutter-mous-qi2-wireless-charging-stand-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro with several magnetic accessories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6778" height="3813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3" name="google-pixel-10-pro-kraftgeek-powershutter-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro using the KraftGeek PowerShutter magnetic accessory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3680" height="2070" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah" name="Mous-Charging-Stand-with-Qi2-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro on a magnetic Mous Charging Stand with Qi2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3643" height="2049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Converting your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig might sound expensive and intimidating, but Qi2 greatly simplifies things. I have used countless gimbals, tripods, and phone stands over the years, and I hate fumbling with the adjustable arms the most. Clamping your phone into a traditional stand or tripod is super annoying, especially when your phone case is on the thicker side. Luckily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod</a> has a magnetic mount.</p><p>The JustTap Tripod is an ingenious way to make the most of your Google Pixel 10's magnetic prowess. All you have to do is slap your phone onto the magnetic mount and set the tripod up — which, by the way, also takes a few short seconds thanks to the "tap to unfold" base mechanism. This tripod is also unbelievably compact and lightweight, with a level of stability and sturdiness that you would not expect from something this light. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> was very happy atop the magnetic mount, even when I moved the tripod around, adjusted its height, and tested it for sturdiness with jerky movements.</p><p>I highly recommend getting a magnetic light for your Google Pixel 10's cameras. The Ulanzi LM19 Selfie Ring Light has several levels of brightness and temperature adjustability. It's highly compact and charges via USB-C, and you can tilt it thanks to the way it is built. It's a fantastic tool to boost your Pixel 10's photography game.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In the past, it was easy to criticize Apple for seemingly holding back basic features, like always-on displays and high refresh rates, from the cheapest new iPhone. The iPhone 17 flips the script, adding both of those long-awaited features and a whole lot more to make the base model eye-catching.</p><p>For those looking for a small and cheap flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S25 has looked great on paper for the past few years. It's the most compact out of the top options from Apple, Samsung, and Google, and it added a third rear camera before it was cool. Now, it's time to see whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a> can beat the Galaxy S25 at its own game in base-model value.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> are both small flagships, but Apple's smartphone is heavier and less compact than Samsung's. It comes down to the displays — Samsung is still using a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25, whereas Apple moved to a larger 6.3-inch screen. Both are now capable of hitting 120Hz refresh rates, and have AOD options.</p><p>Apple is using Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the iPhone 17, and Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the Galaxy S25. Both are made by Corning, but the key difference is that the iPhone 17's cover glass is optimized for scratch protection and has anti-reflective properties. To get an anti-reflective screen on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you have to go with the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to understate the difference in size between the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25. By just comparing the screen sizes, the gap looks minuscule, but there's more to the story. The iPhone measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm and weighs 177 grams, which is larger by every measure compared to the Galaxy S25's dimensions of 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm. The Samsung base model's weight is particularly impressive at just 162 grams — even lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/exclusive-apples-big-bet-and-its-not-the-iphone-air">iPhone Air</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Galaxy S25 packs flagship specs and a larger battery capacity than the iPhone 17 in that small form factor. The only key compromise here is the display, which is smaller by one tenth of an inch. Only you can decide whether the bigger, thicker, and heavier design of the iPhone 17 is a dealbreaker, but I prefer the compact and lightweight build of the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for durability, both phones sport an IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.

Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 runs on an Apple A19 chip that's a lower-tier offering compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 Pro</a> in the Air and Pro models. This could help the Galaxy S25 excel in AI tasks and gaming, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Samsung has the advantage in on-device memory, with 12GB of RAM on the Galaxy S25 compared to the iPhone 17's 8GB. However, the iPhone 17 crucially starts with 256GB of base storage at the same price as the 128GB Galaxy S25. There's more storage available on the higher-end configurations, too. You can buy an iPhone 17 with up to 512GB of storage, while the Galaxy S25 tops out at 256GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.8 main sensor + 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view + 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto with 3x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow (Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold only at Samsung)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of connectivity, the iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S25 both support Wi-Fi 7, 5G, satellite connectivity, and NFC.

This new camera lens now uses a square sensor, a shift from typical 4:3 sensor. The practical benefit of this change is being able to take selfies in either orientation, portrait or landscape, without having to physically rotate your phone. And when there's a big group shot, Center Stage uses AI to automatically expand the view to fit everyone in.</p><p>The rear cameras are a bit less exciting — they're 48MP sensors, a main and an ultrawide.

However, both also stand out in their own way. Aside from the obvious iOS 26 vs. One UI 7 debate, these phones focus on completely different things.</p><p>The iPhone 17 clearly puts an emphasis on the cameras, making it a great option for creators or anyone who loves to take photos or videos. Yes, it has one fewer rear camera than the Galaxy S25, but its 48MP main and ultrawide cameras are top-notch. Plus, the square front-facing camera that makes it possible to capture vertical or horizontal selfies without rotating your device is a standout feature.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 has more raw power with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and it does more with it thanks to Galaxy AI and Gemini. It'll run circles around Apple Intelligence, and the smarts may even help the phone beat the iPhone 17 in gaming and intensive tasks.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either one, but if you happen to care about camera or AI features, you may want to pick the iPhone 17 or Galaxy S25, respectively.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8700225f-d3fb-405c-b2a6-5f513ad68d58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For the cameras</strong></em></p><p>Android users might notice that the iPhone 17 stands out as a camera-focused flagship.

And while I haven't jumped on the smart glasses train just yet, the new offerings from Meta have me really excited about this growing category.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is rumored to have its own AI glasses in the works, which could launch as soon as October alongside the more powerful Project Moohan XR headset. These have a lot of potential, especially as the first real competitors to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). However, with the latest generation being Meta's third attempt at smart glasses, Samsung and Google will have to play catch-up on both hardware and software to make up for lost time.</p><h2 id="all-the-right-upgrades-2">All the right upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen 2-Shiny-Cosmic-Blue-Transitions" alt="The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's only been the last few years that smart glasses started taking off, and that's largely thanks to Meta. In 2021, it seemed a little strange that Meta was diving into this unproven market, but the popularity of the last-gen Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses proved that this is a winning category for the company.</p><p>Admittedly, Meta's last-gen model was the first time I was even remotely interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. I was impressed with how they're able to identify what was in front of me while looking like something anyone could wear, unlike the early attempts of Google Glass.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were some downsides to the glasses, with the main thing being battery life. This was admittedly the biggest reason why I hadn't pulled the trigger on buying them, but Gen 2 fortunately appears to have addressed this.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-03" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is estimated to last up to eight hours on a single charge with mixed use. This feels perfectly sufficient for something like these, which I likely won't be using constantly aside from the occasional question, listening to music, and taking a photo or video here and there.</p><p>Meta also upped the video capture capabilities to a 3K resolution. As someone who loves to capture videos to post on my Instagram stories or Reels, this is a great upgrade.

Gemini's more natural conversational skills, as well as features like Gemini Live, which can easily identify what it sees and even remember things for you, would fit extremely well on a pair of smart glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M" name="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" alt="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1578" height="888" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This could also give the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) a run for its money, as Samsung and Google have the ecosystem to back up Gemini's capabilities. On the one hand, Meta's services have become fairly ubiquitous, with apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp installed on hundreds of millions of smartphones, not to mention Meta AI injected into these apps (whether we like it or not). This, along with the growing popularity of Meta's glasses, gives it a good amount of mindshare among consumers.</p><p>On the other hand, Google and Samsung have been pushing Gemini's capabilities on their phones and other devices. Look at any Pixel 10 commercial and you'll see how the focus is less on the phone and more on what Gemini can do for you in your everyday life. This type of marketing is admittedly quite effective, and I imagine this would translate extremely well with Android XR glasses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>There's also the fact that these glasses would likely have a deeper connection with Android phones than Meta's do, which is another differentiating factor that could play in Samsung's favor. Imagine getting real-time Maps directions, creating new events in Calendar, or translating a conversation with Google Translate, all without taking out your phone.</p><p>Hands-free access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps">your favorite Google apps</a> could be a huge draw over Meta.</p><h2 id="another-galaxy-ring-situation-2">Another Galaxy Ring situation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7" name="google-glasses-ted-2025-demo-nishtha-shatia-02" alt="Samsung Project HAEAN Android XR glasses being shown off at TED 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gilberto Tadday / TED)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Samsung wants its "Galaxy Glasses" to succeed, it's going to have to do more than rely on its name to generate sales. We're seeing Samsung dive into new product categories lately with devices like the Galaxy Ring, and while it was a valiant effort to supplant a growing market, it's still an expensive product that feels a bit like an also-ran to the Oura Ring.</p><p>Samsung will have to create a rather compelling case for why people should buy smart glasses <em>and </em>why they should choose it over Meta. For that to happen, Samsung will have to get three things right:</p><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: They can't <em>look </em>like smart glasses if they expect people to wear them. They should also have multiple styles/colors.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: Samsung hasn't always excelled in this spec, and it will have to really squeeze as much battery as it can to make them useful.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: If they're too expensive, Samsung might as well throw in the towel to Meta.</li></ul><p>Availability is also a concern. Rumors point to a reveal of the Galaxy Glasses in October, while some indications point to a 2026 launch, which could mean even more time for Meta's glasses to hold the spotlight.</p><p>On the plus side, Google's work on Gemini has put it in a good place for integrating into smart glasses, meaning the glasses should be plenty capable. If Samsung can nail everything else above, it could properly challenge Meta's growing lineup of AI glasses and push the market further into the mainstream.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's fine since you're only a bookmark away from most anything Gemini can do; it's a web browser after all.</p><p>Most of them are simply an easy way to do things you could already do after 15 minutes of Googling and trying to find the right buttons. That's what makes them great; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-ai-storybook-new-level-of-imagination-bedtime-update">AI should make complex things easy</a>.</p><p>A few of my favorites are new ways to browse through your web history <em>without</em> you having to do it. The example says something like "<em>what was the website that I saw the walnut desk on last week?</em>" will work, and if so, that's awesome.</p><p>There are also some tools to help people who aren't so internet savvy (and the rest of us who think we are) by blocking web pages that try to auto-subscribe you to them or bolstering Gemini Nano's already good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/browse-safely-with-real-time-protection-on-chrome">Safe Browsing mode</a> with the tools to block fake virus and malware warnings and the thugs that create them.

You can tell Gemini to do something like make you an appointment to get the oil in your car changed, and it will do it for you. That sounds a lot like other things we've been told that didn't quite pan out, but maybe this time things will be different.</p><p>My real concern is that it works exactly as described and makes me an appointment at Pep Boys to change the oil in my wife's car. I don't want an appointment at Pep Boys because the service center down the road is a local business, it's closer, and it's cheaper. I also know the mechanics and technicians and trust them to do anything.</p><p>Google says you're in control and can halt the process at any time, but if I need to sit there and babysit Gemini so it does the right thing, it would be easier to just do it myself.</p><p>This is a stepping stone to bigger and maybe better things, so I won't complain too much if it plays a little wonky.</p><h2 id="when-this-is-coming-and-who-gets-to-try-it-2">When this is coming and who gets to try it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bNSvZ9xdypYNg6mpMn2arF" name="Chrome-AI-tools" alt="A rocket with the Chrome logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNSvZ9xdypYNg6mpMn2arF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of these features are in the process of rolling out now, while others are "coming soon". It's smart to roll it out slowly and even smarter to not give a timeline, so it's what we should expect from any Google feature announcement.</p><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> users, it will be here in the coming weeks with enterprise-grade data protections and controls. Unfortunately, that means Gemini won't be able to leak the Colonel's famous fried chicken recipe or anything else that's important.</p><p>It's coming to mobile users, too. Google says nothing about the mobile and desktop versions being different, so I'm going to assume the same features will be available on your phone, too. And yes, that means Gemini will be built into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-me-crazy-i-prefer-ios-google-chrome-app-androids">Chrome for iOS</a>, "soon", too.</p><p>Now for the part nobody likes: <strong>This is only for users in the United States who have their devices set with English as the default language</strong>. I can understand the need to test it and see what regulators think about it, but that doesn't help anyone who wants to try it and isn't eligible. It's not like there are almost a  billion users in India and Brazil, or anything, right, Google?</p><p>Having said all that, there is one thing missing from everything Google had to say: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. I know Chromebooks already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Gemini integration</a>, so maybe this will "just work" once it comes to your account. The company makes no mention of any changes for Chromebooks or Chrome OS.</p><h2 id="i-m-surprised-2">I'm surprised</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo" name="surprise5.jpg" alt="Surprise" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>I figured something like this would be coming once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-googles-big-court-win-mean-for-us">all the courtroom dust over Chrome was settled</a>. Chrome and Search are tied together in a really deep way, and that's why web browser market share is so important to Google.</p><p>What surprised me is (what feels like) the restraint Google has shown by not throwing the AI kitchen sink into Chrome and making everyone hate it. These features all seem... reasonable. I won't use all of them, but there are several I can see myself using every day, as I do 100% of my work in the Chrome browser. Is it enough to make me want to switch my "personal time" web browser from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> to Chrome? It could be.</p><p>What's most important is that it won't make things worse. Nothing pops up automatically, nothing seems too intrusive or invasive, and Gemini is getting better, whether we want to admit it or not. I'm actually looking forward to this.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But each one has its strengths and weaknesses, so I'll help you pick the best XR glasses option for you.

This model is slim and modern, with a vibrant 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED display and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus back panel, all protected by an IP67 water/dust resistance rating.</p><p>The phone also sports a versatile triple-camera system with a 50MP primary lens, and there's a reliable 5,000mAh battery that should easily clear two days on a single charge.</p><p>For performance, you're getting the still-solid Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, which is a bit on the older side but still performs quite well in most use cases. Wrap it all up with six years of OS and security updates and you're looking at a pretty exceptional experience for the price.</p><p>Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> generally come with a few sacrifices, and the Samsung Galaxy A36 is no exception. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset might lag a bit if you do a lot of gaming or streaming on your phone, and you're only getting 128GB of base storage (with no ability to expand via microSD). The Galaxy A36 5G also ditches the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is one feature that previously helped Samsung's A series stand out from the crowd.</p><p>With that being said, the Galaxy A36 may not be a powerhouse, but it's a solid phone that's simply <em>good at being a phone. </em>No bells and whistles, just sturdy construction and performance where it counts. Pair this device with one of those excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> from Total Wireless and you're setting yourself up for success this fall.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The user's photos show that Google is seemingly testing a small change to the menu presented when clicking on your profile icon on your TV homescreen. The user snapped a photo of Google TV's alert, stating that it's moved "your Library and Watchlist to under the profile icon."</p><p>Now, both those options are there, alongside the pre-existing "Your Services" and "Content Preferences," with the account switcher and add account icons above them.</p><p>Outside of the profile menu, Google TV's redesign in testing also revamped the navigational bar. Again, the company highlights this change, stating, "Search is now here, and we've renamed For You to Home." Google has housed these options within a pill-shaped bar with "Live" and "Apps" in there, too. However, as the publication also notes, Google TV has separated the settings menu and the screensaver option into their own pill-shaped menu next to your main content hub selection.</p><p>It's been reported that this small <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Google TV</a> homescreen redesign hit the user's device in v1.0.806977084. It's not uncommon for Google's tests to be limited, meaning only a few users ever see them at the start. It looks like that's what we're dealing with again, probably to give Google time to make any more changes (if there are any) and to receive feedback from those who got it unexpectedly.</p><h2 id="a-little-tlc-for-google-tv-2">A little TLC for Google TV</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.52%;"><img id="TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5" name="google-tv-homescreen-navigation-redesign-reported" alt="Google TV is supposedly testing a redesign that alters its navigational bar, including Search and changing "For You" to "Home."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1009" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.26%;"><img id="bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5" name="google-tv-profile-icon-menu-buttons-moved" alt="Google TV is reportedly testing a redesign to the profile icon menu, bringing in the Wishlist and Library options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1016" height="531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google TV is kept relatively tame in terms of updates and things to get excited for; however, we did have that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque</a> update to stare at.

Users can expect double the battery life, meaning the frames can last up to eight hours with "typical" use and charge to 50% in ~20 minutes.</p><p>Meta even ventured into a pair of glasses that are exclusively for outdoor enthusiasts, craving adventure, or even sports enthusiasts. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> glasses feature a 12MP wide-angle camera that captures up to 3K resolution, along with Slow Motion, Hyperlapse, and adjustable stabilization for smooth action shots.

The earbuds come in black or white colorways, both of which feature a transparent design and an aluminum and plastic case.</p><p>Speaking of the case, it has a built-in dual-microphone system with a dedicated "Talk" button. This "Super Mic" makes calls clear even in very loud places. All you have to do is press the button, and the audio input switches from the buds to the case, and the case transforms into a mic. Pretty handy for when you need to record reels for Instagram/TikTok or if you need to record a quick voice note.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Nothing Ear 3</a> also gets upgraded sound quality, featuring a larger 12mm dynamic driver, up from the Ear 2, which will supposedly increase the bass to 6 dB and up to a 4 dB improvement in treble.

The one feature that really stands out is the ability to customize icon shapes — neat, right? It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen, and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match your preference. You can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><p>Another feature that's customer-facing is for the fitness enthusiasts; this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives users the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors, and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  The beta also introduces enhanced security features for both developers and users.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

However, anyone who’s played poker knows it’s not always the best hand that wins. Strategy, timing, and knowing when to go all-in often matter more than the cards themselves. Apple’s September event at Apple Park was, at first glance, a showcase of a strong hand: sleek devices, bold design, and carefully crafted messaging.</p><p>But the real game runs deeper. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone 17 Air and Pro lineup</a> may be Apple’s “pocket aces,” but they aren’t enough on their own to drive the next wave of growth, which is Apple’s ultimate endgame. Apple’s real bet lies in three calculated moves: disciplined pricing, design-driven differentiation, and aggressive trade-in incentives. While most Android players focus on price wars and long spec sheets, Apple is counting on these three strategic moves to make the aces matter and ‘win the hand’ —  fuel a massive upgrade cycle in the year ahead.</p><h2 id="bet-1-design-driven-product-differentiation-2">Bet 1: Design-driven product differentiation  </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS" name="Tim-Cook-Apple-iPhone-17-event" alt="Tim Cook on stage at the iPhone 17 launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1183" height="666" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Air — Style Icon: </strong>Apple knows design sells, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test">iPhone Air</a> is built to turn heads. Slim, lightweight, and instantly recognizable, it appeals to consumers who value aesthetics over maxed-out performance. At 5.6mm, it is slimmer than the 5.7mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and $100 cheaper.</p><p>What impressed me most was how incredibly light it felt. “It feels like Air,” I said, a sentiment echoed across Steve Jobs Theater.

This reflects Apple’s new approach: rather than size or price-based differentiation, it leans on design, style, and performance, sprinkling novelty and premium features throughout the lineup. The result is a more consistent premium feel throughout, at nearly the same price as last year.</p><h2 id="bet-2-restrained-pricing-strategy-2">Bet 2: Restrained pricing strategy </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KDDPuBEvu52cnEVmtiF94m" name="iPhone-17-prices" alt="Prices for Apple's iPhone 17 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KDDPuBEvu52cnEVmtiF94m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2056" height="1156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Apple’s decision not to raise prices</a> across most of its lineup is under-appreciated,  especially given inflationary pressures and higher costs driven by tariffs and accelerated supply chain shifts. Still, most models held steady while storage doubled, giving consumers more for the same cost. Even the Air delivers a premium product just under $1,000.</p><p>This restraint sends a clear message to its consumers: Apple won’t add pressure to already-stretched wallets. That promise matters more than any spec sheet in today’s inflationary climate, and it will help sustain Apple’s momentum in emerging markets where long-term growth rests.</p><p>Apple is able to lean into its scale, vertical integration, and supply chain control to make this strategy work without hurting profitability, a play most Android rivals can’t match. While competitors struggle with shrinking margins and price wars, Apple is cementing its 40% value share of the smartphone market and 70% share of the premium ($1,000+) segment.</p><h2 id="bet-3-the-upgrades-engine-2">Bet 3: The upgrades engine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH" name="iPhone-13-Pro-Max" alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this feeds into Apple’s endgame: driving a massive upgrade cycle. The Air serves as a style icon, the Pro models target heavy users, and the baseline 17 offers strong value. Stable pricing lowers upgrade friction and reinforces value, while aggressive trade-ins (up to $1,100 in the US) make upgrading a “no-brainer.” Early preorder data suggests the strategy is already working.</p><p>To top it off, over 430 million iPhones shipped in 2020–2021 are now hitting the 4–5-year mark — the typical upgrade window for iOS users per IDC. No matter what model they bought then, the iPhone 17 lineup gives them a compelling reason to trade up.</p><h2 id="the-final-hand-2">The final hand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For Android OEMs, this is a learning opportunity.

Its mix of design differentiation, price restraint, and ecosystem lock-in pulls users forward, even when rivals match or exceed specs.</p><p>Apple’s event may not have delivered the slimmest phone in the smartphone world or the loudest AI when you stack it against Android counterparts, but its real play is subtle and powerful: the sum of design, pricing, and trade-in incentives.

Weeks ahead of the next installment of Prime Day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet has slid back down to 36% off</strong></a>, making the lockscreen ad version just $90 for members.</p><p>Those who don't want the lockscreen ads, can pay to have them removed at the time of purchase or later on. Additionally, while this sale is for the base-level, 32GB edition of the tablet, you can also get the 64GB version for 44% off and just $10 more.</p><p>In any case, we think the Fire HD 10 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-tablet-for-sharing">best Fire tablet for sharing</a>, partially because it's a solid, affordable Amazon device with easy Alexa compatibility, parental controls, and a wide range of apps. Named for its touchscreen display of slightly over 10 inches, users get a Full HD resolution, around 13 hours of battery life, built-in Dolby Atmos speakers, and more—all for under $100 with this discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k" name="123 1.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 10:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$139.99</del> <strong>$89.99 for Amazon's Early Prime Day Deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's Prime Day event <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">is confirmed</a> for October 7 and 8, but weeks ahead of that, the retailer has launched a familiar deal: 36% off the price of the Fire HD 10 tablet. We like this tablet for its affordability (especially as it regularly gets discounted), as well as its decent-looking, 10.1-inch touchscreen. It's certainly no premium tablet, but it's a good, affordable addition to any Alexa smart home household, or to families who are looking for budget-friendly versatility.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a cheap tablet deal with easy access to Alexa voice assistance; you're planning on getting a tablet that can be used as a shared device, potentially including parental controls for family use; you want a tablet for under $100 that will still get the job done and offer decent battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a premium-level tablet and you need high-level performance or an AMOLED screen; you need your tablet to have high-res cameras for meetings, photos, or videos; you aren't otherwise an Alexa user and you might prefer a device compatible with another digital ecosystem, such as Samsung or Google.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Amazon Fire HD 10</a> is our favorite Fire tablet for sharing, and there's more than one reason why. The latest generation of the lineup offers a decent 10.1-inch Full HD display, and either 32GB or 64GB storage options, both of which are on sale at the time of writing.</p><p>Plus, it comes with a built-in mic, speakers, and a 5MP selfie cam that's good enough for basic video calling (though it may not be the top pick for high-level professional meetings).</p><p>For those who need more than 64GB of storage, the HD 10 also comes with a microSD port that will allow users to get up to 1TB of expandable storage. Performance is backed by a 2x Arm Cortex-A76 Octa-Core processor and 3GB of RAM, which isn't much but should allow some multi-tasking.</p><p>Overall, it's not a bad pick for under $100, but if you can hold out for the official Prime Day sale, we can probably expect to see an even bigger discount.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not every Android and iOS device sports this visual assistance through Gemini Live, but Google says that's "coming soon."</p><p>For the fun times, Nano Banana has been making headlines in September. The powerful image editor within the Gemini app, which leverages Google's DeepMind, lets users get extremely whacky with their ideas, and let Gemini do the rest. There are several "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-nano-banana-examples/">use cases</a>" that have stood out this month, such as turning a photo of a cat into a pixel-world video game.</p><p>Custom Gems you've created through Gemini can now be shared, as well as using the AI in Canvas to create an app "with no coding experience."

Meta is looking for its iPhone moment with a metaverse strategy involving VR, AR, and smart glasses, and it might just have one. Products like Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta shades are flying off the shelves, and are even starting to get mainstream attention.</p><p>A lineup of smart glasses once confined to a few Ray-Ban styles now includes new products such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Ray-Ban Meta Display. Meta's smart glasses product offerings are becoming more varied and attainable in every way but one: accessibility. You can choose to get Meta tech in a growing assortment of eyewear brands, frames, and styles, but if your eye prescription isn't supported, you might be out of look.</p><p>To be clear, Meta is doing amazing things with accessibility for people with low vision and blindness. Be My Eyes support and commands like "Hey Meta, look and describe" use the cameras onboard smart glasses and AI to provide audio descriptions of the real world to people who couldn't otherwise see them. It's some of the most exciting accessibility technology available, powered by Meta glasses.</p><p>However, there's a community somewhere in the middle that's being underserved by Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica. All of Meta's smart glasses have low prescription ranges, from the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> to the latest Ray-Ban Meta Display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">I fell outside those ranges in 2024</a>, and after a year of waiting for Meta to improve its offerings, I'm taking matters into my own hands and ordering custom lenses elsewhere.</p><h2 id="why-meta-s-supported-prescription-ranges-aren-t-cutting-it-2">Why Meta's supported prescription ranges aren't cutting it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-4" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Officially, Meta supports prescription lenses between -6.00 to +4.00 total power on the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN. For Meta Ray-Ban Display, the prescription range is even tighter, between -4.00 to +4.00 total power. While this might feel like a step backward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> has a screen built into the right lens, presumably adding technical limitations to supporting higher-strength eye prescriptions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> isn't available with prescription lenses at all; that isn't surprising because neither are the Oakley Sphaera frames they are based on. However, there are third-party prescription inserts available for Sphaera, so it'll be interesting to see whether they pop up for Vanguard in the future.</p><p>The reason why I'm tough on Meta for its limited support for prescription lenses is that it's an easy problem to solve. Using high-index lenses, higher prescriptions outside of Meta's currently-supported range can be made thinner, fitting into frames like Meta Ray-Ban and Meta Oakley HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP" name="Oakley-Meta-HSTN-display-shelf" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses on display in all five styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta competitors, such as Solos, offer a much wider prescription strength range of -15.00 to +10.00 when using these thin lenses. Additionally, third-party sites like GlassesUSA and Lensology are filling the gap by making custom lenses for prescriptions beyond what Meta provides through its own online shop and partner retailers.</p><p>I was hoping that, since the prescription lens problem was seemingly solved by third parties, Meta would expand support for a wider variety of prescription needs with its latest round of smart glasses announcements. There were even pre-Connect rumors of Meta glasses designed specifically for prescription lenses. Unfortunately, that didn't happen — the supported range stayed the same for Meta's basic smart glasses, and shrunk for the new display version.</p><p>I'm not sure what the holdup is for Meta in addressing this key limitation, but after waiting through the Oakley Meta launch and Connect 2025, I've decided to stop holding my breath and purchase lenses via a third-party instead.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta for comment regarding its prescription lens support for smart glasses and its future plans, but the company didn't immediately respond. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-not-waiting-and-you-shouldn-t-either-2">Why I'm not waiting, and you shouldn't either</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-side-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If smart glasses are truly the future, manufacturers need to do everything they can to make them accessible to everyone. That includes people with vision correction needs who can't or don't want to wear contacts. All tech should be accessible, but if smart glasses really are the future of communication and productivity, there's even more pressure to make the form factor work for everyone.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said during a 2025 earnings call that people without smart glasses would be at "a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people" in the future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-people-without-ai-glasses-will-be-at-a-disadvantage-in-the-future/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). That kind of language puts smart glasses in the realm of necessity rather than luxury, meaning that people needing glasses for basic sight shouldn't have to wait for them to become <em>smart</em>.</p><p>Instead, I ordered Oakley Meta HSTN and prescription lenses from Lensology separately to get the experience in the here and now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lensology.co.uk" target="_blank">Lensology</a> is a lens crafter based in the U.K. that specializes in "click and fit" service — you order custom lenses online and pop them into your frames when they show up at your door. I uploaded my prescription, picked Transitions lenses, and placed my order.</p><p>If all goes well, in a week or two, I'll have my prescription Oakley Meta HSTN glasses ready to wear — despite my vision-correction needs being unsupported by official Meta retail channels. While I still hope Meta one day expands its prescription lens offerings, people shouldn't have to wait to experience this essential tech, and they don't have to thanks to services like Lensology.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="80024167-89bf-44ed-b0b9-03b7d3bdaa3e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QR2XTuj5vdUaC8ZbiHtMM.jpg' alt="An official product render of brown Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its charging case"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Great smart glasses...</strong></em></p><p>...if you don't need prescription lenses or your needs fall within the supported range.
