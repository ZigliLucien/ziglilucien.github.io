As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> is the operating system you probably interact with most often via supported TVs, Chromecast hardware, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, it's safe to say the experience has been lacking.</p><p>Now, there are signs that Google is working on expanding Android TV sleep timer functionality to the main Google TV operating system, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-tv-sleep-timer-3561527/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The publication found code strings and references to sleep timers in <strong>version 1.0.756918669</strong> the Google TV Home app. This app serves as the main Google TV interface, and it's what you interact with while navigating and controlling Google TV streaming devices.</p><p>These code strings point to features that aren't currently offered for the sleep timer in Android TV. Additionally, their appearance prominently in the Google TV Home app suggests the sleep timer will eventually come properly to the Google TV operating system.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><code>Cancel timerPause timerResume timer%1$d seconds until TV turns off%1$d minutes until TV turns offYour sleep timer has ended, but something went wrong when turning off your TV. You can still turn it off manuallyUnable to turn off TV</code></code></pre><p>Android TV doesn't support pause and resume functions for sleep timers, hinting that a refresh is in the works for the feature. Sleep timer notification warnings at various intervals are new, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa" name="google-tv-streamer-review-22.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Android figure and remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zG58uwCatbYwnLZsweERoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other code strings hint at Google letting users take sleep timer actions directly from the notification warnings. For instance, you might be able to add time to a sleep timer when a notification warns you that your Google TV device is about to shut down. However, the full details are currently unclear, since these code strings haven't materialized into actionable or viewable notifications just yet.</p><p>Either way, it seems to be a good sign that Google is working on building a proper sleep timer for Google TV. Previously, Android TV's implementation of the feature required OEMs to build their own user-interfaces for the handy tool. Soon, Google TV users may be able to use convenient sleep timers to make sure their nighttime binges don't continue after their eyes close.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Still, the chip that will power the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in the U.S. is still unclear. Rumors and leaks have debated whether the flip-style foldable will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> or the Samsung Exynos 2500 for months. The conflicting reports seem to have only intensified as we slowly get closer to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's expected release window.</p><p>A report from the Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025052792731" target="_blank">Hank Yung</a> earlier this week claimed that Samsung will use a mix of Snapdragon and Exynos chips in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 depending on the region. For example, the publication cited the Snapdragon 8 Elite as being planned for the U.S. and Canada. In that case, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">Exynos 2500</a> could power the flip phone in most other regions.</p><p>Things got interesting when another report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-usa-exynos-not-snapdragon/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> on Thursday, May 29 claimed the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will indeed be powered by the Exynos 2500 in the U.S. Specifically, SamMobile writes that "Galaxy Z Flip 7 firmware for the U.S. makes it pretty clear that the processor inside the phone is the Exynos 2500."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6  cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ApqkPpviaQcYgYmtvj6ce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this leaves the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor up in the air. Aside from the above statement, SamMobile didn't provide any more details regarding the firmware evidence signaling the device will be powered by the Exynos 2500. Hank Yung similarly hasn't shared concrete evidence that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip will power the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in the U.S., either.</p><p>The dueling reports regarding the Galaxy Z Flip 7's processor mean that we don't know which chip will power the phone in which region. Usually, leaks and rumors provide clarity surrounding a smartphone launch. This time, it seems the Galaxy Z Flip 7's chip situation is getting more convoluted before it becomes clear.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

As humans visit shrines to worship you, they'll generate prayer power that you can collect and use to grow your powers. As your influence grows, so does your population's notoriety worldwide.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buFk2eK6kKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The game isn't a massive open world but, rather, a level-based strategy sandbox with a clear storyline bridging each locale together. As you and your citizens grow in influence, you'll come across enemies that want to bring you back down to size. Whether it's bandits that appear out of the fog of war or another civilization bent on war depends entirely on each scenario.</p><p>But while some of these features can be found in other games, the "virtual pet" portion of the game is unique among VR titles. It's your creature that makes How to God truly unique among Meta Quest strategy games and the thing that gives it the most character and intrigue, by far.</p><p>As a "living" creature's master, you must shape your pet to represent you in the best way since you can't micromanage it at all times. This isn't a Familiar that you summon on command, and it isn't a creature that you can just pick up and put wherever you want. It must be molded to properly represent you in the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF" name="how-to-god-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of How to God for the Meta Quest 3 showing villagers praying at an altar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YZUefCDcyj7skWLtKgpDeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Thoughtfish GmbH)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever trained a pet before, you'll know there are very different trains of thought. Do you squirt them with a spray bottle when they've done something bad? You certainly can in How to God, if you want, but you may find that positive reinforcement works better.</p><div><blockquote><p>Between the game's complex alchemy system, the virtual pet training mechanics, and village building and strategy, this feels like a title that's easy to sink hours into.</p></blockquote></div><p>As you're training your creature, you'll still need to take care of each villager's needs in addition to doing anything you can to gain more power. Whether you choose to expand your village and earn praise or keep the population at bay by feeding your creature — thus inciting fearful prayers and power — is entirely up to you.</p><p>I also loved the game's alchemy system. Just like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/dimensional-double-shift-hexas-job-simulator-multiplayer">Job Simulator games</a>, How to God lets you grab different elements and combine them, like mixing fire and water to make steam. While it doesn't look nearly as intricate as those games, I'm eager to explore everything the developers have implemented, as I've been told there are dozens of combinations to be discovered.</p><p>The game is set to launch in the next few months as a single-player experience, but the developers have hinted that their goal is to eventually incorporate a multiplayer component. Until then, though, the campaign and sandbox modes should keep you plenty busy on release.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Last month, an APK teardown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-messages-will-soon-use-color-to-differentiate-rcs-and-sms-mms-users">revealed color and text badges for RCS contacts</a> in the Google Messages app beta. It's now appearing widely for Google Messages beta testers, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/28/google-messages-new-chat-rcs/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>While the feature is still not available in the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, this expanded availability for beta testers signals it is nearing a public release. The tweak aims to make it easier to see whether a user is messaging someone using RCS messaging or old-school SMS/MMS messaging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS can be more secure and feature-rich than SMS or MMS</a>, delivering features like reactions, read receipts, and higher-quality video.</p><p>As such, it can be advantageous to know whether the chat you're starting is with someone using RCS or not. You might want to send a long video over RCS, but not over MMS. That's why a future update will add small RCS badges next to the contact names of people who have enabled the service, with no badge for SMS/MMS texters.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1kxui7v/rcs_tag_is_showing_besides_the_rcs_enabled_phone">RCS tag is showing besides the RCS enabled phone numbers!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The change comes along with a new view for the <strong>New conversation</strong> page, which is now called <strong>New chat</strong>. Google Messages beta users will see this screen after tapping <strong>Start chat</strong>, and it'll eventually make its way to public users. RCS users will get Dynamic Color for their chats, serving as another visual cue separating new and old-school messaging options.</p><p>The update user-interface is appearing as part of Google Messages app beta <strong>version 20250527_01_RC00</strong>. While it's showing up more widely than before, it's still a limited rollout — likely occurring as a server-side push — exclusive to beta testers.</p><p>It's unclear when these UI tweaks for Google Messages will roll out for everyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53546025&_gl=1*1ev768s*_ga*MTg5NTcwNDAxMC4xNzMzNTA5MTY1*_ga_541ENG1F9X*czE3NDg1MjQ4NjYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4NTI0ODc3JGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">new report released</a> by IDC today (May 29), global smartphone sales are now predicted to grow only by 0.6% overall in 2025.</p><p>“Since April 2nd, the smartphone industry has faced a whirlwind of uncertainty. While current exemptions on smartphones have offered temporary relief, the looming possibility of broader tariffs presents a serious risk,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><p>The global market intelligence firm said that it had to lower its earlier prediction of 2.3% that it made in February, due to the high uncertainty around fluctuating tariffs, economic challenges, "such as inflation and unemployment across many regions leading to a slowdown in consumer spending."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.08%;"><img id="uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3" name="IDC-phone-sales-2025-forecast" alt="IDC Decreases its Worldwide Smartphone Forecast to 0.6% for 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uuJyXBXsfxFpoxJLJbEqo3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="488" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report also states that smartphone sales will continue to remain low for the next five years, and may see single-digit growth, averaging at 1.4%. Several factors could cause this, and the firm attributes it to people retaining their phones for longer periods, and an increasing trend of buying refurbished smartphones instead of new ones, as they can be lighter on the pocket.</p><p>Furthermore, IDC's report claims that despite the ongoing tensions between China and the U.S., the two countries will be the major contributors to the said growth of 0.6% of smartphone sales.</p><p>"The US Market is forecast to grow 1.9% in 2025, but it was impacted from the ongoing US-China trade war as growth was pulled down from 3.3% due to increased uncertainty and tariff related price increases,” said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1877px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WqGNS3zmoTLkVNET92Azj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1877" height="1056" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android phone sales in China are said to increase by 3% YoY, due to the increase in government subsidies and discounts to push smartphone sales. Which is why Apple could see a 1.9% decline in sales as Huawei takes the spotlight.</p><p>Lastly, the firm notes that recent signals from the U.S. on a potential tariff hike on smartphones have only made the future uncertain for OEMs outside the U.S., with smartphone vendors who export to the U.S. having to deal with unnecessary geopolitics. As the Trump administration was recently levying 25% on phones built outside the U.S.</p><p>"Despite these headwinds, India and Vietnam are expected to remain the key alternatives to China for smartphone production,” Popal added.</p><p>However, it is important to note that earlier today, the U.S. Court of International Trade judges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-court-trump-recent-tariffs-halted-illegal-ieepa">ruled to halt</a> President Trump's recent 10% tariffs on "virtually every U.S. trade partner." The judges state that the administration's leverage of the IEEPA shouldn't qualify here, and that Trump has "exceeded" any rightful authority.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the real headline is that it's locking in your rates for talk, text, and data for a full five years.</p><p>The new plans, namely Experience More ($85/month) and Experience Beyond ($100), are stepping in to replace the old Go5G Next and Go5G Plus. As for the regular Go5G plan, it's also getting the boot.</p><p>Business users are getting some extra love too with the new Experience More for Business and Experience Beyond for Business plans. The big perk is free access to Secure Wi-Fi, which is a smart VPN that kicks in automatically whenever you’re on sketchy public networks.</p><h2 id="travel-and-data-perks-2">Travel and data perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF" name="t-mobile-logo-google-pixel-8-pro.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile Logo on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/du63zwPBbYBDFHWBTnwQEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile's Experience More plan also packs unlimited talk, text, and data, along with free Netflix plan (standard tier) and Apple TV Plus thrown in. The carrier has upped the ante with 60GB hotspot data (that's 10GB more than before). When traveling, you'll get 15GB high-speed in Canada/Mexico and 5GB in over 215 countries.</p><p>One cool new thing with the Experience More plan is that it's adding satellite coverage, something the old Go5G Next didn’t have. This starts in July and stays free through the end of 2025. After that, if you want to keep the satellite service, it’ll run you $15 a month.</p><p>On the other hand, the premium Experience Beyond plan keeps satellite coverage free, with no end date in sight. You're also scoring a massive 250GB of hotspot data. It keeps the same Netflix and Apple TV Plus perks as Experience More, plus throws in Hulu with Ads as an extra bonus.</p><h2 id="business-boost-2">Business boost</h2><p>In a big win for business users, the Experience Beyond for Business plan cranks hotspot data up to 300GB. It’s built to keep remote teams and on-the-go offices connected without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Both plans throw in phone upgrade options—Experience More lets you switch it up every couple of years, while Experience Beyond lets you refresh your phone once a year.</p><p>The cool part is you get free T-Satellite with Starlink until the end of 2025. It hooks your phone up directly to satellites, so you can text even where there’s no cell signal at all.</p><p>T-Mobile says you just need a clear patch of sky to use the new T-Satellite with Starlink. It's rolling it out fully in July 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company's data shows that the top 10 phones in this past quarter have retained "stable" overall global sales. However, Android phones are only present for spots five through nine. Interestingly, four of the top Android phones from Q1 are budget, Samsung Galaxy A series devices.</p><p>In fifth place is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Galaxy A16 5G</a>, followed by the Galaxy A06. According to the data, the former experienced a 17% YoY (year-over-year) growth, likely due to its North American launch on January 2. This took place a couple of weeks before Samsung's major flagship reveal, and that's where Counterpoint's research takes us next. Specifically, we're looking at the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is the only one of Samsung's recent flagships to break the top 10 best-selling phones.</p><p>The S25 Ultra comes in at seventh place, leaving the Redmi 14C 4G and the Galaxy A55 6G to round out the bunch.</p><p>Elsewhere, Apple's iPhones take the top four spots, which sees the base iPhone 16 taking #1. It's then followed by its other 16 series siblings, the 16 Pro Max and the 16 Pro.</p><p>Regarding sales, Counterpoint highlights devices under $100, stating phones in that category became the "fastest growing" in Q1 2025.</p><h2 id="this-time-last-year-2">This time last year...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Counterpoint adds the Galaxy S25 Ultra's placement in Q1 2025 is slightly lower than the fifth spot held by the S24 Ultra last year. The post attributes this change to the S25's "shorter sales window" in Q1. Despite that, Counterpoint's research shows the entire series has delivered "steady results" for Samsung in the year's initial quarter.</p><p>If we take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">a look back at Q1 2024</a>, Samsung reclaimed its top spot for most shipped phones. Research indicated that the Korean OEM's performance was due to the popularity of its Galaxy A series from late 2023 into the next year. We're seeing a similar trend now, thanks to the recent Galaxy A16 5G launch at the start of 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, Counterpoint foresaw the premium smartphone market's growth in 2024 because of AI advancements and features on those phones. Currently, the company's report highlighted the Galaxy S25's inclusion of Google's Gemini, stating this "signals Samsung’s shift toward a more agentic AI experience, enhancing user productivity and personalization."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Per reports, the tariffs were reportedly 10% and concerned "virtually every U.S. trade partner."The U.S. Court said on Wednesday, May 28, that the tariffs have been considered illegal due to them "exceeding" the president's rightful authority.</p><p>The publication cites the judges, surfacing the following statement: "The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder."</p><p>The IEEPA, otherwise known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, is the primary catalyst here. The president's administration has leaned on the IEEPA to "justify" its recent 10% tariffs on many overseas trade partners. What's more, a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, defended the 10% tariffs, stating the U.S. "trade deficit" with other countries has "created a national emergency that has decimated American communities."</p><p>However, the U.S. Court claims the IEEPA's true intention is to rectify any trade imbalances, not emergency action.</p><p>CBS News states the Trump Administration plans to appeal the court's roadblock. The U.S. Court of International Trade judges have also blocked new tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada.</p><h2 id="tariffs-the-impact-2">Tariffs & The Impact</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-review-hero-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 in blue on a blue table outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's been a major shift in how companies are handling their imports in the U.S. after Trump's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">tariffs and trade rule changes started</a>.

That's all T-Mobile needs to do, and what allows the company to build an app that records your screen the first time you use it and until you turn the feature off. It isn't recording anything outside the app (it can't), and it has an explanation for why it needs this information. Its bases are covered 100%.</p><p>But it still feels wrong. It leads to my real question: <em><strong>why</strong></em> is this allowed to happen?</p><h2 id="blame-apple-and-google-2">Blame Apple and Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze" name="hey-google-logo-ces-2018-2.jpg" alt="A Google Logo at CES" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aCh9Kz8bpZgVr3uzzz3Mze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recording or otherwise <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-record-screen-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">capturing the contents of your screen</a> isn't anything new, and I think everyone has done it once or twice, at least. It can be useful for both you and for quality control from the developers and providers of an app or service. I'm not opposed to the idea on any level, and I don't think anyone should be; it's just another feature.</p><p>Where I think issues come into play is that this happens without asking. <strong>There is no way you can use the app and turn the setting off without it happening</strong>, so having a setting means little when it's enabled by default. I do not care that the only information you provide while using the app is captured, or that T-Mobile doesn't share any of it with any other party.</p><p>I care that it is enabled by default. I <em>really</em> care that Apple and Google have no problem allowing, nay, enabling this behavior. Two companies that constantly crow about your privacy and how they protect you and your data, pretending to be some sort of benevolent benefactor and a shield between you and the "bad guy."</p><div><blockquote><p>The problem isn't that T-Mobile is recording your screen; it's that this feature is enabled by default.</p></blockquote></div><p>The reality is a lot simpler and sinister: Google and Apple only care about Google and Apple, T-Mobile only cares about T-Mobile, and you have to care about yourself and your privacy. I'm very skeptical about any sort of "privacy initiatives" from huge tech companies (and often very vocal about that), but I can't see any other explanation, especially now that this has been talked about for a week.</p><p>Someone at Apple and Google has likely been made aware, and so far, no action has been taken.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4" name="Pixel-9-home-screen" alt="Pixel 9 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnGMiYfmuSZvbfNsE7qhs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My complaining about policies that permit this isn't going to change anything either. A simple outcome is for T-Mobile to change one variable in the app's code from true to false, rebuild it, and send out a mandatory update. A better solution is for Apple and Google to change the rules so that while this is allowed, users need to be told up front and given a way to decide for themselves.</p><p>Most people have no idea this is happening, and a good many of them wouldn't care anyway. Google and Apple are the ones who need to care and exert better control over their platforms.</p><p>As such, Android Central has reached out to both Google and Apple to inquire about their plans for updating their privacy policies for their app stores.

The email teaser says Gemini on the Pixel Watch is designed to make "navigating life easier," likely pointing to many of the AI's hands-free features that can leverage your voice.</p><h2 id="gemini-wear-os-2">Gemini & Wear OS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had Gemini on the Pixel Watch (and Wear OS) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">on the brain since earlier this year</a>, and we're still yet to see something more concrete. Most of what we "know" is similar in style to what Google's just teased in its I/O 2025 recap. Users <em>should </em>be able to converse back and forth with Gemini for assistance and to enable it to complete tasks without much manual human input.</p><p>Of course, Gemini's Wear OS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">takeover will push the Assistant out</a>, but that's not surprising to anyone anymore.</p><p>I/O 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6#section-gemini-on-wear-os">kind of skipped over</a> any huge Gemini/Wear OS mentions; however, Google promised it would arrive "in the coming months." What we're still curious about is whether or not this update will coincide with Wear OS 6's launch or if it'll stand alone. The AI is expected to remain similar to Assistant in the way that users summon it. Users may still retain the "Hey Google" command to produce Gemini when it arrives.</p><p>What's more, there's speculation that Pixel Watch 3 users can hold its side button to produce the AI, too. On the flip side, there's a battery life concern. Since Google may opt to keep Gemini's ears open, there's a chance it could add some additional strain on your watch's battery.</p><p>Since I/O 2025 has come and gone, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">read up on everything that transpired</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

If the leaked design is real, it will be a fusion of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch Ultra, with a rotating bezel sitting atop the squircle case. And whether you love the change or resent the switch, there's reason to be a bit concerned.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-renders-360-video-5k-leaked/">the leak</a>, the Watch 8 Classic will feature a 1.5-inch display, a 435mAh battery capacity, and dimensions of 46 x 46.5 x 14.2mm. We don't have any information on weight, but whether it uses steel or titanium, it's not hard to guess that it could be one of the heaviest Android watches we've seen.</p><p>Remember, Samsung consistently fudges the thickness of its watches by excluding the sensor bump from the calculation, as if it were somehow removable or optional. The Galaxy Watch 7 is "9.7mm" thick but actually measures about 12.7mm. Likewise, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is closer to 15.5mm than its 12.1mm estimate.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kc93PvsHI_8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Now hit the video above and pause at the one- or seven-second mark. Is this watch actually 14.2mm thick? If you take the "12mm" Ultra case and add a 2mm-thick rotating bezel, that would make sense. But then the <em>actual</em> thickness would be closer to 17mm, which would dwarf every smartwatch I've ever worn.</p><p>All of this is nothing more than speculation until we try on the Watch 8 Classic in person or get official specs to confirm the weight. However, I believe this leak because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> have been trending this way.</p><h2 id="this-classic-isn-t-made-for-normal-smartwatch-fans-anymore-2">This 'Classic' isn't made for 'normal' smartwatch fans anymore</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-scaled" alt="A render of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, with a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WexJkvnPMQW9Qtjwqqq7b9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My mom comments on my "spaceship watches" whenever I visit her while reviewing a new watch.

It's still a fair guess that the Watch 8 Classic has a 46mm titanium case with a stainless steel bezel atop it.

The criticism over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> being an Apple clone was overblown, as it has a distinct style, but it's still darn big by many people's standards. Same goes for the bulky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, which uses Samsung's trick to "measure" 11.8mm thick without the sensor.</p><p>They all appeal to diehard Android users, but scare off the more mainstream audience that buys light, thin, and cheap squircle watches.</p><p>If you don't believe me, I held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> last Christmas with my extended family, and while my non-techie family members liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for their distinct style, they <em>hated</em> the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra.

But will people buy it?</p><p>The above leak claims the Watch 8 Classic will have a 435mAh rated capacity, or 450mAh typical capacity. That's a very slight bump over the 425mAh Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 6 Classic; it's also well short of the 590mAh Galaxy Watch Ultra or Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>Heavy watches usually deliver better-than-average battery life or other perks. But if the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic brings back the same 40-hour estimate, the same 1.5-inch display, and (likely) the same Exynos chip and 2GB of RAM as last year's model, then what's the justification to buy a watch that big?</p><p>That said, I have skewed tastes, and I do think the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (as leaked) looks pretty cool! I resented using the digital touch bezel on the Ultra, making the return of the physical bezel with exact controls all the more appealing. But the weight and thickness could be deal-breakers for long-time Classic buyers.</p><p>So, as we wait until late July for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, I'm hoping we'll eventually get some additional context to make the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sound a bit less... intimidating.</p><hr><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Android 16, alongside upcoming iOS 19, is likely going to fix that — according to new findings from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ios-19-esim-transfer-to-android-3561644/">Mishaal Rahman through Android Authority</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.15%;"><img id="DKPYoorthvDgorBRwcQshE" name="Android-16-QPR1-Beta-strings" alt="Android 16 hidden eSIM transfer code" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DKPYoorthvDgorBRwcQshE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1814" height="420" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman/ via Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-1-now-starts-rolling">Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1</a>, Rahman found some new strings in Google’s SIM Manager app, which usually allows transfer of eSIMs between Android handsets. The latest findings from the said strings indicate that Apple’s next operating system will be adding support to wirelessly transfer eSIM data to Android phones.</p><p>Per the strings, iOS 19 is expected to add a new “Transfer to Android” page, which can be accessed through Settings. Under the upcoming page, users will likely see a new “Other options” button — and it is expected to allow iOS users to initiate a wireless transfer of iPhone eSIM to an Android phone. The process should further comprise a scanning of a QR code on the Android phone — in a similar manner as seen on eSIM transfer between current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200-06" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since it is happening on an iPhone, the QR code process is said to be involving the user to enter a “session ID” and a “passcode” on the Android device — both generated by the iPhone. Furthermore, the strings also mention that if two devices aren’t able to connect wirelessly, it could mean the iPhone isn’t running iOS 19 or later, which is an indication that the feature could possibly ship with the next iOS version.</p><p>Speaking of, it is scheduled to be unveiled at WWDC (June 9-13) this year with the next version of iOS. While it is probably called iOS 19, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/apple-to-rebrand-device-operating-systems-ios-26-macos-26-watchos-26?srnd=undefined">latest Bloomberg report</a> suggests Apple is revamping the entire operating system lineup and it will be called iOS 26 instead. Regardless, the new feature should help users avoid the need to reach out to carriers to transfer their eSIMs between iPhone and Android devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-57">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>In a recent "Sharing Session," AYANEO provided more details about its upcoming Pocket S2 handheld.</li><li>This included a better look at the design, along with some of the various features and capabilities.</li><li>The AYANEO Pocket S2 will soon be available for pre-order from Indiegogo, but pricing has yet to be revealed.</li></ul><p>It's been about two and a half months since we first caught wind of the AYANEO Pocket S2, when it was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">GDC 2025</a>. Now, we're finally learning more about what the handheld is expected to offer in terms of both the design and performance.</p><p>The original announcement came alongside Qualcomm's introduction of three new gaming-focused chipsets, headlined by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3. This is the successor to the G3x Gen 2 that was announced in August 2023, with AYANEO being the only company to actually use it in a device. After it initially arrived with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, AYANEO has since used the G3x Gen 2 in four different handhelds, most recently, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ace-pre-orders-open-ahead-of-next-months-launch">Pocket ACE</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4Uty2BPNs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Much like its predecessor and the Gen 2, the Pocket S2 will be the first device to make use of the G3 Gen 3. During the Sharing Session, we got a better look at the aluminum and glass chassis, complete with sides that are more rounded. This should hopefully quell any issues for those, like myself, who found the original Pocket S to be uncomfortable during longer playing sessions.</p><p>The Pocket S2 remedies another problem from the original, thanks to the fan cutout on the back plate. This, paired with the "fishbone biomimetic air outlet" along the top, will hopefully prevent any potential thermal throttling.</p><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong></strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>AYANEO Pocket S2</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch IPS, 2560 x 1440, 600 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>UFS 3.1 / UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>8000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Extras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>RGB Joysticks, Hall Triggers, TMR Electromagnetic Joysticks, Micro-switch D-pad & ABXY buttons</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian Black, IceSoul White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>One of the more impressive aspects of the Pocket S2 is the battery, as AYANEO managed to pack an 8,000mAh battery into this sleek chassis. It's not completely unheard of, as AYN's Odin 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal</a> both feature batteries of the same size. However, both of those handhelds are larger and thicker than the S2.</p><p>Something else that was rather intriguing is that the Pocket S2 apparently "supports Turnip Driver Out of the Box." For the unaware, these are graphics created by the community that are designed to improve performance and compatibility in a variety of emulators.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HcV6JR9pkvCaW5CQBboHcd" name="ayaneo-pocket-s2-turnip-driver-support-banner" alt="AYANEO Pocket S2 Turnip Driver support banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HcV6JR9pkvCaW5CQBboHcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm interested to see just how AYANEO is implementing this into the software of the Pocket S2. Not every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulator</a> includes support for third-party drivers, so I can't help but wonder if that means we'll run into issues if the drivers are implemented on a system level.</p><p>Sadly, AYANEO didn't provide any details regarding the price of the Pocket S2, so we'll have to see how much of a dent this will put in our wallets. However, we do have a landing page for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-s2-6-3-screen-snapdragon-g3-gen3-handheld/coming_soon">Indiegogo campaign</a>, where you can register to be notified when pre-orders are live.

Infinix in particular saw a lot of success with its GT series of devices over the last two years; I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-gt-10-pro-review">GT 10 Pro</a>, and the GT 20 Pro built on that foundation.</p><p>The GT 30 Pro was just announced, and the phone is all set to make its debut in India. Ahead of its global launch, I had an email interaction with Infinix's Product Director Weiqi Nie to get a better sense of what the brand is doing differently this time around, and how it is positioning the GT series.</p><p>Design has always been a key selling point of previous GT models, and Infinix has doubled down in that area with the GT 30 Pro. The phone has a "cyber-mecha" design aesthetic that looks plain cool, and while the GT 10 Pro looked like a derivative of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Nothing's phones</a>, that is definitely not the case with the GT 30 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyNi3DxbnxLcuatnc4kCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nie noted that Infinix took inspiration from "futuristic machines and modular aesthetics" in designing the device. "Over time, this concept has evolved to be more expressive, functional, and aligned with the needs of modern gamers. In the GT 30 Series, this vision comes to life through the upgraded Mechanical Light Waves system. Built on deep integration between software and hardware design, it delivers 14 lighting scenarios and over 20 customizable effects that respond dynamically to actions like charging, gaming, and notifications."</p><p>Infinix basically wanted to deliver a phone with a bold design, and thanks to the custom pattern at the back and vibrant lighting, the GT 30 Pro manages to stand out quite a bit. Of course, while design is a consideration, the biggest factor when choosing a gaming phone is the performance.</p><p>Infinix went with MediaTek instead of Qualcomm, and Nie said the Dimensity 8350 offered the brand the ideal mix of high frame rate gaming and thermal management. "MediaTek’s platform offered the right combination of performance, efficiency, and scalability to bring the GT 30 Pro’s vision to life. The Dimensity 8350 Ultimate delivers smooth high-frame-rate gaming, effective thermal control, and optimized power usage—crucial for maintaining consistent performance across both gaming and daily use."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rteJ7SdkHegBdRDWiQw9jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8000" height="4500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"The Dimensity 8350 Ultra's capabilities provided the performance headroom needed to integrate features like a 144Hz AMOLED display, advanced cooling solutions, and responsive gaming enhancements, without compromising on price accessibility. This approach allows the GT 30 Pro to deliver a flagship-level experience that is designed for a broader range of users."</p><p>Overheating continues to be an issue on gaming phones, with this year's Qualcomm chipsets in particular having a higher thermal threshold. Thankfully, that isn't the case with MediaTek designs, and Nie said sustained performance is a "core priority" on the GT 30 Pro, particularly during longer gaming sessions. The GT 30 Pro features Infinix’s 3D Vapor Cloud Chamber (3D VCC) liquid cooling tech, and Nie noted that the brand does "intelligent software optimization that dynamically manages power and thermal behavior based on real-time usage."</p><p>There are two accessories as well — the MagCase and MagCharge Cooler — with the latter being an active cooling solution that funnels cool air to the back of the device. "The GT 30 Pro takes a system-level approach—combining a high-performance chipset, efficient cooling, and smart charging solutions such as Bypass Charging 2.0 and optimized wireless charging with active cooling. This ensures stable, high frame rates over long periods, without overheating or throttling—even while charging."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4JjRAKuu63zcutuZDLXCNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll be testing the GT 30 Pro's prowess in this regard, and having used other MediaTek mid-range designs, I'm excited to see what the phone brings to the table. The GT 30 Pro also retains ultrasonic triggers, allowing gamers to assign in-game actions with relative ease — they make a genuine difference while gaming.</p><p>The phone gets a 144Hz panel, and what I like the most is that it unlocks 120fps in demanding titles including PUBG Mobile. Like other brands catering to this niche, the GT 30 Pro is aimed at a younger audience, and the design and visual aesthetic reflects that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg" name="Infinix GT 30 Pro" alt="Infinix GT 30 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHcutDg8hGeJJ6d2JkJLNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Infinix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Infinix is focused on phones, Nie said the brand is looking to build an ecosystem of gaming devices under the "GT Verse" umbrella. "GT Verse is a full-stack experience designed around the needs of mobile gamers. In addition to the GT 30 Pro, the lineup is expanding with GT Buds 4 with 30dB ANC and low-latency Game Mode, the GT Power bank with 55W multi-device fast charging, and even a dedicated cooling accessory under development."</p><p>"This ecosystem approach allows users to stay connected, powered, and immersed across devices—whether they’re gaming at home or on the move. While future product plans will be guided by community feedback and innovation readiness, the GT Series will remain at the core of Infinix’s long-term vision to serve gamers with purpose-built tools across categories."</p><p>Pricing is a big part of what makes a budget gaming phone succeed, and Infinix is targeting a $300 price point with the device. Given that there aren't that many gaming-focused phones in this category, the aggressive positioning combined with the feature-set of the device should allow the GT 30 Pro to win out against its rivals. With an imminent launch in India, we don't have to wait too long to know more about the GT 30 Pro, and I'll have more to share on the device in the coming days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it took seemingly <em>forever</em> to start up in One UI 7 and got quite irritating to use on a regular basis.</p><p>That's been completely fixed in One UI 8. It used to take roughly 5 seconds from tapping the "AI Select" button to the time you could actually select content on your screen. Now, tapping AI select makes the feature effectively immediately available, taking me about 2 seconds to circle an image on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display.</p><h2 id="multitasking-is-90-10-better-2">Multitasking is 90:10 better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3" name="one-ui-8-multitasking-improvements-split-screen" alt="Using the new 90:10 multitasking feature on One UI 8 and Android 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hVGob4XuQ4MsH2zhq85C3.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> came out in 2023, it blew our minds for several reasons, but the phone's multitasking capabilities were among the best features to use daily. Paramount to that was something called OnePlus Canvas, a feature that let you dock an app to 10% of one side of the screen and quickly switch between any running app by tapping the window.</p><p>Android 16 and One UI 8 have adopted this 90:10 feature, as it's called, letting you resize a split window down to 10% of its normal size. This lets you easily juggle two apps with a single tap without feeling like the app is squashed, as normal split screen tends to feel. Holy cow is it ever a massive upgrade on the normal split window multitasking, and it'll give me a reason to finally use more than one app at a time.</p><h2 id="quick-share-got-some-quicker-tweaks-2">Quick Share got some quicker tweaks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-quick-share" alt="Comparing the Quick Share UI between One UI 7 and One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPWT73kpbCYUqedEyrxnWA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quick Share has been one of the most useful additions to Android in quite some time, but receiving files from people who aren't contacts has been a bit of a hassle. A fancy new UI change from Samsung makes this much easier, and it all starts when you tap the Quick Share button in the quick toggles pane.</p><p>The familiar Send screen is still the default when opening Quick Share, but a new Receive tab makes it simple to quickly get files from anyone so long as the window is open. No more selecting from the "no one, contacts only, or everyone" options. Just open the Receive window and you're good to go, no matter who the other person is.</p><h2 id="more-powerful-reminders-and-routines-2">More powerful reminders and routines</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-reminders-app" alt="Comparing the changes in the Reminders app between One UI 8 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3S64SVHg9ZjWBeSkYVaN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the dumber things Google ever did was remove the ability to add a location to reminders in Google Assistant.

The upgraded Reminders app now also includes quick category buttons at the top, making it easy to find everything you need at a glance.</p><p>Routines also got an upgrade, now letting you select from new preset routines like weather, which is pretty slick if you need a reminder to grab your umbrella or rain coat before it rains, or sunscreen when the cloudy days end.</p><h2 id="samsung-health-gets-a-bulk-up-2">Samsung Health gets a bulk up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time, I tried to log my food intake so I could track calories, macros, and just do better. The problem is that I always forgot to input my meals, and wouldn't remember until I had forgotten the exact details of what I ate. Now, Samsung Health can remind you to log meals throughout the day, circumventing this common problem.</p><p>As you eat better, you can also now use the power of peer pressure to help you workout more often. An upgraded Together feature in Samsung Health lets you issue run distance challenges to all your contacts, setting goals to be the first to run a specific distance each week.

We don't need big overhauls every release. It's just not necessary. So, Samsung is focused on making One UI 7 even better with helpful features and changes that seem to make a lot of sense. Even the weather app, seen above, has a more realistic feel, giving you a better idea of the weather the moment you open it.</p><p>Some users on Reddit have reported bugs already, which makes sense since this is a beta release. If you want to check out One UI 8 early, open the Samsung Members app on your Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, or Galaxy S25 Ultra, then tap the One UI 8 Beta option in the image carousel at the top. Once you're enrolled, it'll download and install the system update. We don't recommend doing this on your only phone, as bugs could cause problems for any number of apps.</p><p>If you come across a bug, use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshoot/TSG10003603/">bug reporting tool</a> to let the developers know so that they can get it fixed in the next beta release. This helps everyone — not just you — so users are encouraged to use the tool as often as possible, even if Samsung knows the bug already exists. This is Samsung's fastest One UI update ever, and it's great to see Samsung working so hard to deliver on that seven year update promise for the Galaxy S25 series so quickly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company demoted all the ways you can quickly build custom web apps with Gemini, and specifically Canvas, its AI-powered workspace for coding and much more. There's skepticism <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tech-talk-can-you-really-build-an-app-or-game-with-an-ai-chatbot">about whether AI can really build an app</a>, and that may be why Google built a web app of its own using Gemini that you can try out right now.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-canvas-stats-io-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google explained its process for building the web app, which is designed to highlight some announcements from I/O in a fun and engaging format. The company asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to "analyze the transcript from the keynote, pull out some impressive numbers and offer explanations of them." After that, Google says it made "just a few tweaks to ensure accuracy."</p><p>That led to the creation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/c30bda1a3edb" target="_blank">Google I/O 2025: By the numbers</a>, an interactive web app made almost entirely using Gemini. Numbers are displayed in a flipboard-style format, and you can click or tap a number to read the corresponding fact from the I/O keynote. It's a neat way to recap what you missed from the event, and get a glimpse of how Gemini can be used as a coding agent.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.17%;"><img id="wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-2" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVVc3WYj97ot8L6CTmGjd7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4448" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.35%;"><img id="69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7" name="Gemini-Web-App-IO-1" alt="A screenshot of the Gemini web app for Google I/O highlights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69qLBRzPNFUkVdTvzFqzf7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4436" height="2278" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since you're exploring the Gemini web app directly in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">Canvas</a>, you can play around with the preview of the web app itself or view the code used to create it.

When clicking Gemini's starry icon, its side panel will now display a text box detailing the "summarized content." Users can interact with this drop-down menu for quick bites of information without having to sit through a lengthy video.</p><p>However, summarizing a video's content isn't all Gemni is capable of in this patch.</p><p>Google highlights the AI model's ability to list "action items" from a video. Action items are direct calls for you (the viewer) to do something. Google uses the example of a planning video, which tells the user to finalize a campaign schedule and secure a location for its "spring pop-up." If Gemini detects things like this, it will list them under the "list action items" function in the side panel.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini's newfound video capabilities pave the way for specific user questions.

You've heard of them even if you didn't know it; companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cricket-unlimited-adds-hbo-max-ads-its-unlimited-plan-free">Cricket Wireless</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mint-mobile-reduces-rates-to-dollar15-per-month-with-a-deflation-initiative">Mint Mobile</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-fi/google-fi-wireless-celebrates-10-years-with-a-new-affordable-plan">Google Fi</a> are all MVNOs.</p><p>What that really means is that they lease giant amounts of usage rights from bigger carriers with actual infrastructure like towers and cables in place. Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, for example. It's a separate company, but it runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvnos-use-t-mobiles-network" target="_blank">T-Mobile's</a> U.S. network, with many agreements outside of the U.S., allowing it to operate almost anywhere in the world.</p><p>The agreement means they are sort of like you, a customer of a major cellular carrier. Of course, they do things a lot differently and use a lot more of the network than you or I ever will.</p><p>Things get a little murky with some of these arrangements. What I mean is that a physical network carrier like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> can also run an MVNO that uses its network (in this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a>).</p><p>The company books are kept separately, and there are different plans and rules, but the big company also owns the small company. I don't know why they choose this route versus offering different plans with similar pricing, but I'm sure it's a wise business decision. Carriers are <em>really</em> good at those.</p><h2 id="so-what-s-the-difference-2">So what's the difference?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM" name="visible-sim-galaxy-s20-angle-wide.jpg" alt="Visible SIM card Galaxy S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdwFo579iLkovNxVQuKadM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While they seem to be duplicates of each other, they really aren't. There are three major differences between an MVNO and a "regular" carrier.</p><p>The first one, and what you might have read about on the internet, is that an MVNO can offer service at much cheaper rates. In some cases, prices are almost cut in half for what sounds like the same service plan on the same network. That's kind of true, but you need to know about the other two differences as well.</p><p>Next is the difference in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-access-visible-customer-support">customer service</a>. Now I'm not saying that big carriers like AT&T or Orange offer excellent customer service, but they do offer more help than you'll get from a typical MVNO. Cutting back on customer support staff is one of the ways that an MVNO can offer such cheap service. They won't leave you high and dry, but don't expect expert answers for every question you might have or a quick solution to every problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg" name="T-Mobile-store-logo.jpg" alt="T-Mobile store logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, we have to talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/when-do-carriers-start-throttling-you-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">network deprioritization</a>. What sounds like a made-up word is a real thing, and it happens frequently in some places. When a network location gets really crowded and it starts to affect the quality of your connection, MVNO customers take a backseat to customers of the parent network.</p><p>I know that sounds confusing, so here's a real-world example of it in action: I use Google Fi for my carrier, but until recently, my wife used T-Mobile. Google Fi uses the T-Mobile network, so coverage and quality are the same 99% of the time. The one percent difference? If we take a trip to downtown D.C. for any sort of event, like seeing the cherry blossoms or for the July 4 fireworks show, my phone service sucks.</p><p>T-Mobile customers have priority when it comes to using the network, and MVNO customers, like me and my Google Fi phone, get to use what's left over. When it's super crowded and people are densely packed into a smaller area, your MVNO carrier connection can suffer. It's a real thing, even though you won't see it very often.</p><h2 id="should-you-use-one-or-should-you-stick-with-the-big-companies-2">Should you use one or should you stick with the big companies?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC" name="verizon-warehouse-logo.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in warehouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBdrXjDvPJVp5k2dxT83oC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>If you make the switch to an MVNO, you will save money, that's for sure. But you need to be aware of and OK with the drawbacks.</p><p>Are you the type of person who doesn't want to hassle with problems? If you would rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-att-customer-phone-walk-in-repairs">carry your phone into the carrier store</a> and let them fix whatever is wrong, then an MVNO might not be for you.</p><p>A bigger issue is the coverage. I live way out in the suburbs and never see any depriorization issues in my day-to-day life. But as mentioned, they are there, and it does happen. If you live or work somewhere like Manhattan or Los Angeles, you might not get the quality of service you want when you use an MVNO, especially during peak times when people are using their mobile devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV" name="mint-mobile-16-9.jpg" alt="Mint Mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMQxU6Q4cqf4T6qEvWyjrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mint Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you<em> really</em> need to do is try it for yourself. All MVNOs offer a month-to-month service plan, and many even allow you a risk-free trial for just this purpose. Don't shut off your current service, but order a SIM card from any of the popular MVNOs that seem like a good fit and give it a try. If you can test under the worst conditions, like a holiday or during a sporting event, even better. Make sure you have service when and where you're going to need it.</p><p>If it doesn't work for you, that's OK. You can always try again next year, because the improvements carriers make to their networks also benefit the MVNOs that use their infrastructure.</p><p>If it does work, and you're okay with being your own first level of support, you can save yourself a significant amount of money.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, the company may be looking to fit these superb camera sensors into a smaller package for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. Samsung is planning to use an inkjet printing process to manufacturer thinner Galaxy S26 Ultra lenses, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36403" target="_blank">The Elec</a> (translated to English).</p><p>A company subdivision, called Samsung Electro-Mechanics, is tasked with creating camera lenses for Galaxy devices, and will reportedly switch to the inkjet printing process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/05/new-camera-optics-could-make-galaxy-s26-ultra-thinner-than-s25.html">Android Headlines</a>).</p><p>Currently, The Elec reports that Samsung uses film layers within camera lenses to reduce lighting issues during capture, like lens flare and ghosting. The extra layers add to the camera lens' overall thickness, which could be reduced if the film was swapped with a printed layer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-camera-islands-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JgxEwPQ7NTjprkdmDmYjpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inkjet printing process serves as a slimmer alternative to traditional lens films. It involves putting matte ink directly on the part of the camera lens known as the "rib" — this is the portion of the camera housing that takes in light from the lenses, pushing it towards the actual camera sensors. With less space needed between the lenses and the sensor, the camera housing as a whole can become more compact.</p><p>According to The Elec's report, Samsung previously shared this technology in a patent application in 2018, but it didn't end up being officially registered and patented.</p><p>With a thinner camera lens, it's possible that Samsung could reduce the size of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>'s camera bump. The company could also use the extra space to house bigger components, like a larger battery, but a smaller protrusion for the camera lenses is most likely. These reports are currently unconfirmed, so we'll have to wait until the Samsung Galaxy S26 is officially announced to know which changes are coming to the phone's camera system for certain.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-10-years-tips-tricks/">blog post</a>, Google brought out the birthday cake and two gifts (updates) to keep Photos on its A-game. To mark a decade, Google Photos is set to receive an updated, redesigned in-app editor. The post states this new editor will offer "AI-powered suggestions" when sprucing up your photos.</p><p>More than that, these suggestions will combine several of Google Photos' available AI editing tools for "quick edits." Users can browse through these suggested actions and see if they like the result. However, if you're more interested in one particular part of a photo, Google says you can tap on specific parts and still receive AI editing suggestions.</p><p>This update will hit Android in June, leaving iOS users to wait until "later this year."</p><p>The second update, though small, breathes new life into sharing Google Photos albums with QR codes. Rolling out today, users can "generate QR codes" to share with people nearby. Those scanning your code can view the album or add pictures.</p><h2 id="photos-extravaganza-2">Photos Extravaganza</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeeWLu2zMq8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google slips in a few tips to keep Photos users on the ball, like the ability to hide certain people or places from Memories. To do this, the post instructs users to head into <strong>Photos > Settings > Preferences > Memories</strong>. From there, dates, people, and even pets can be hidden so you're not thrust into sad moments or moments of longing. Additionally, Google reminds users that they can search in Photos using keywords.</p><p>The app will be able to leverage your gallery to find instances of you in a dress or even you at a sporting event.</p><p>Google drops some analytical knowledge, touting that Photos has roughly 1.5 billion users every month, and over 9 trillion stored photos and videos.</p><p>Google Photos has had a couple of notable updates in the past year, like the patch that brought the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections</a>" tab. This area replaced the app's old library, giving users a more intuitive, clean look at their albums, documents, and more. The update included a small change to its UI, placing more important options up top, while hiding away buttons for the Locked Folder down below.</p><p>A few months later, in late 2024, Google Photos brought in the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-updates-page-rollout">Updates</a>" page. Replacing the "Sharing" button, "Updates" gives users a full-on glimpse of new shared albums, photos, and group conversation updates. Let's also not forget that Google Photos is reportedly ready and waiting on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/early-google-photos-code-material-3-expressive-changes-spotted">Material 3 Expressive upgrade</a>, which might (hopefully) arrive soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the post highlights Google's efforts to combat a wide range of scams, there are still a few exploiting online users, such as customer support threats. These are scams involving nefarious persons who are posing as "legitimate support" to retrieve your personal information.</p><p>Google states users should be aware of these when browsing online; however, Chrome might offer some relief.</p><p>While the company has "long blocked ads" for third-party support, Chrome has recently received Gemini integration (specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano</a>) to better detect and block potential scam attempts.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google states text messages are another area where scams remain prominent. Package tracking scams rank quite high, often trying to fool users into believing they must "pay additional fees." Another scam instance regards toll roads. Google says this type of attack shares a few similarities with package tracking scams, likely due to them being "orchestrated by the same bad actor groups."</p><p>For both attacks, Google says its Messages app has recently received real-time detection capabilities to alert/warn users before anything happens.</p><h2 id="google-advances-its-protections-2">Google Advances its Protections</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:283px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.01%;"><img id="wgE2mTmq2LAwGZfZBbn2TR" name="google-messages-advanced-scam-protection-example" alt="A Google Messages alert of a potential scam, which gives users the choice to "report and block" the phone number." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgE2mTmq2LAwGZfZBbn2TR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="283" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Google brought awareness to Malvertising and Fake travel sites in its updated advisory report. Both attempts are largely at play when browsing, even affecting ads seen through Google Search. The company states it has focused more on weeding out these aggressors, taking the appropriate actions against violators of its online policies.</p><p>May was chock-full of Google looking to improve its security/defensive measures <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-android-scam-spam-notification-gemini-protection">against malicious users when browsing</a>. A few weeks ago, Google Chrome had an update that launched AI-powered warnings in the browser on Android. Courtesy of Gemini, Chrome will now inform users about potential scams/threats. Moreover, Chrome will also analyze notifications to see if those are malicious, too.</p><p>Leading up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a>, Google's Android Show detailed the company's new scam protections for calls and texts. One key aspect was Google's interest in furthering Android's software so it can "block certain actions" if it thinks you might be involved in a call scam. The Messages app has been upgraded with the ability to identify new scams, such as toll road/billing, crypto, financial impersonation, and more.</p><p>These updates build off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">Google's March feature drop</a>, which brought crucial security updates.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Rumor has it that the upcoming Google series will sport different camera setups, maybe even a downgrade, and that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-color-palette-series-rumor">alleged color scheme</a> will include a mixed assortment of shades across the board. But I'm not interested in any of these things. There's only one thing on my mind.</p><p>A question that keeps bouncing off the insides of my brain is whether the Pixel 10 will finally bump the embarrassing charging speed of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 series</a>. The base model Pixel 9 and mid-level Pixel 9 Pro charge at 27W, whereas the upper-tier Pixel 9 Pro XL charges at 37W wired charging speeds. None of these numbers presents Google in a positive light.</p><p>If you're wondering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">why I care about charging speeds</a> so much, it's quite straightforward. Until battery tech is more advanced and we can get multiple days of heavy use out of a single charge, fast charging will always be relevant, and this is an area Google has fallen behind in.</p><h2 id="how-did-google-let-it-get-this-far-2">How did Google let it get this far?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="npqHMbKcRLYuCJJAaRdiXF" name="google-pixel-9-45w-charger-02.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npqHMbKcRLYuCJJAaRdiXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Truly, what's more surprising is that Google had the gall to consistently disappoint us with the charging speeds of its flagship phones over the past few years. The Google Pixel 6 supported 21W wired charging, which isn't a whole lot different from the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro's 27W speed. In a span of three years, Google didn't bother to give this sector a proper boost.</p><p>I've given Samsung a hard time over the S25's outdated 25W charging speed, but at least the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> support 45W fast charging. That's a notable difference in contrast to the Pixel 9 Pro XL's 37W charging speed.</p><p>How are such large brands even allowed to get away with such horrid charging specs? We celebrate these devices, award them with titles, call them the best of the best, and yet they continue to disappoint us.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9MJimwwhxTKiviNEQWibXE" name="google-pixel-9-charging-01.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9MJimwwhxTKiviNEQWibXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funny enough, I don't care about the camera setup as much as I do about the charging speed anymore. Why? That's because the Pixel family is already adept at photography and recycles old lenses anyway. We get a fantastic photography experience regardless of this fact.</p><p>I'm sure the Pixel 10 will have superb cameras, even if one of the Pixel 10 models features a downgraded primary or secondary lens. However, Google needs to pay a lot more attention to the charging speed.</p><p>What made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> such a big success is its reputation as the battery king. This mighty little device has a long-lasting battery that reduces the need to charge the Pixel 9a every day. Perhaps if the charging speed were faster, users wouldn't mind having to charge more often.</p><p>Speaking from personal experience, I couldn't go back to using the Pixel as my main device once I switched over to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. The battery and charging specs are indomitable, and once you become reliant on 100W charging and an all-day battery life, it's very hard to give it up.</p><p>I can't imagine how awful it will look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">if Google actually raises the price of the Pixel 10 Pro XL by $100</a> but retains a lame charging speed like 37W or 40W. Will people still be interested in buying such an expensive Google Pixel phone with such lackluster charging specs? I don't think so.</p><p>On the other hand, if Google surprises us with 50W to 60W fast charging, that rumored $100 price hike might just be worth it for a lot of people, myself included.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6770c4f0-0720-448c-8c3d-5adbf038b137">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T8WTnYRAhZw6DGua2jptsk.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL official render - Porcelain - front and back"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best Pixel for now</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL boasts a 5,060mAh battery that lasts all day paired with 37W wired and 23W wireless charging.

Like the previous firmware, the One UI 8 focus is also on enhancing AI features on the Galaxy S25 series, and includes three key factors: "multimodal capabilities, UX tailored to different device form factors, and personalized, proactive suggestions."</p><p>The popular Now Bar and Now Brief features from One UI 7 will see notable improvements as they can now showcase even more customized insights and suggestions to help users stay on top of their tasks and keep with their daily routine with the help of AI.</p><p>Additionally One UI 8 is also providing settings where it allows users to enable processing the data only on the device. Users can further choose to opt for cloud-based AI processing.</p><p>Samsung's popular Auracast is also seeing improvements like support for effortless audio connection through QR code scanning and sharing, and further allowing multiple Auracast devices to sync with devices like Galaxy Buds 3 and hearing — the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-and-gn-showcase-auracasts-potential-for-enhanced-hearing-accessibility">recently showed off</a> the capabilities in London.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ctp8dHsotoiwzbR4fmw8MQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-02" alt="Signing up for the One UI 8 beta 1 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ctp8dHsotoiwzbR4fmw8MQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the new Reminder app on Galaxy S25 series also gets a glow up with the One UI 8 as it can manage all your reminders in one place with new interface. Users can further share a list of to-dos with a single press of a button. Quick Share is also believed to be getting enhancements with this software update.</p><p>The lengthy changelog of the latest beta highlights even more features like the ability to find files easily even if the users don't know the file name they are looking for. Samsung Internet is also seeing a redesign to access the features quickly. Multitasking should also be gaining notable improvements with enhanced display support and split screen functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="u4aZqF9c5gLpgUsHQNvauK" name="One-UI-8-beta-reminder-app" alt="One UI 8 beta features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4aZqF9c5gLpgUsHQNvauK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other perks of the One UI 8 include new Calendar features, the addition of new preset routines, and routine actions.

Some more improvements can be seen across Communication, Camera, Accessibility, and in Security and Privacy preferences.</p><p>Since the rollout has just begun, we could be seeing more of what's hidden in the One UI 8 beta, and it is still unclear whether the recently spotted new Weather app revamp and audio version of Now Brief summary made their way to the first beta firmware.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Some hate wearing a bulky Garmin watch to bed, but don't want to miss out on Body Battery data. Others want the same Garmin fitness data without the watch form factor, preferring to wear luxury watches during the day.</p><p>It appears these Garmin fans will finally get their wish, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://the5krunner.com/2025/05/23/garmin-is-making-a-whoop-competitor-out-soon/">The5krunner</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://garminrumors.com/report-garmin-preparing-to-launch-whoop-like-band-with-sleep-and-recovery-focus/">Garmin Rumors</a>) reports being "100% sure" that a Whoop-like Garmin armband will arrive by July or August 2025, based on a source, with some key details of what to expect from it.</p><p>Essentially, this "Garmin Sleep Band" — the name comes from a "source document" — will use LED indicators instead of a screen. Tap gestures will disable the silent vibration alarm or check the battery life. Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-garmin-vivoactive-6-looks-and-sounds-pretty-similar-to-its-predecessor">Garmin Vivoactive 6</a>, this Sleep Band would use an optical sensor to detect a light sleep stage within your alarm window before waking you.</p><p>The leak isn't comprehensive, as we don't know pricing, design, or whether it'll require a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a> like the Whoop Band does. But it would fit a new niche for Garmin, which has stuck to chest straps like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">HRM 200</a> until now.</p><h2 id="a-basic-backup-or-fully-fleshed-device-2">A basic backup or fully-fleshed device?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk" name="COROS-Heart-Rate-Monitor-on-arm.jpeg" alt="The COROS Heart Rate Monitor worn on the author's arm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfMqGuYQorsmSpwdMiQuGk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An armband could deliver insights and alarms while being less bulky and distracting than a Garmin watch. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin can take several paths with its Sleep Band, starting with one that sticks to its namesake and solely offers sleep tracking with an optical sensor. For people who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate wearing a watch to bed</a>, that would solve the problem and (hopefully) keep the price low because of its specialization.</p><p>Ideally, the Garmin Sleep Band would have the newest Elevate v5 sensor found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-and-570-revealed-all-key-upgrades">Forerunner 970</a>, since that would deliver the most accurate HR and skin temperature data, along with standard Garmin overnight data like blood oxygen, heart rate variability (HRV), and the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/i-put-garmins-connect-trails-breathing-variations-and-rucking-sport-to-the-test">breathing variation</a> metric.</p><p>Ideally, the Garmin Sleep Band would capture active ECG or passive heart rhythm data, as well. Whoop even offers blood pressure data on its new, expensive Whoop MG, but I don't think Garmin needs to target "medical-grade" accuracy for this device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-HRV-status" alt=""Last night HRV" graph on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLrgkb32YSqxBvN99HLNBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I like Garmin's nightly insights, but not having to wear my bulky Fenix 8 at night to get them. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the next level, the Garmin Sleep Band would support all-day health tracking, in order to properly measure things like Body Battery, daily readiness, and recovery. That seems like an obvious choice to substitute for a watch, even if you must check the Connect mobile app for the results.</p><p>But would this device automatically detect and track workouts like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop Band</a>? Most external Garmin sensors must pair with a watch, though the newest Garmin HRM 600 chest strap does standalone workouts.</p><p>Arm-based optical readings are generally more reliable than wrist-based ones. The Garmin Sleep Band could hypothetically boost your workout accuracy, with or without a watch. It might not match a chest strap's precision, but it would certainly be more comfortable.</p><p>That said, I doubt this Sleep Band would offer built-in GPS, an altimeter, or other Garmin watch perks. If it has an accelerometer and IP68 dust and water resistance, it can deliver the basics that people would want out of a fitness tracker.</p><h2 id="hoping-garmin-doesn-t-mess-this-up-2">Hoping Garmin doesn't mess this up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YvyYmzDnRuFiyV9WqGBXH5" name="whoop_4.0_recovery_ice_bath.jpg" alt="Whoop 4.0 Recovery Ice Bath" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvyYmzDnRuFiyV9WqGBXH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Garmin's Whoop competitor will hopefully be thinner and subscription-free </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Whoop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm intrigued by the idea of a Garmin Sleep Band. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">$79 COROS HRM armband</a> for its HR accuracy and lightweight comfort at just 19g or 0.67oz. I could see this new Garmin product fitting the niche of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> at a more affordable price while staying hidden on your bicep, leaving your wrist and fingers for non-tech accessories.</p><p>However, the question is whether this Sleep Band is merely an accessory or a true competitor to the Whoop. A Whoop band is "free" but costs $200/year with the mandatory subscription. Garmin could easily undercut Whoop with a subscription-free rival band, but its priorities have changed recently.</p><p>Garmin watches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/forerunner-570-and-970-have-made-garmin-tiered-strategy-clearer-than-ever">getting pricier than ever</a>. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmins-post-tariff-strategy-could-include-pricier-watches-and-cutbacks">Garmin's latest earnings call</a>, it talked about finding ways to counterbalance tariffs, such as increased prices. I'm concerned that Garmin might make it too pricey as a "backup" device or emulate Whoop with a mandatory Connect Plus fee, propping up their membership numbers and profits in one swoop.</p><p>At the moment, the Connect Plus paywall is only for optional features like AI summaries, offline trails, and advanced data charts. So I'm going to assume, until told otherwise, that Garmin will stick to its usual business model.</p><p>And in <em>that</em> case, the Garmin Sleep Band will make plenty of long-time users happy by letting them take <em>off</em> their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> without losing access to the data they rely on.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Recently, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/16/gemini-prompt-bar-redesign-android/" target="_blank">overhauled the prompt bar</a>, and it now puts key tools like “Deep Research” and “Canvas” front and center. There’s also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-search-history-results-spotted">new “Search History” feature spotted in the app</a>, letting you dig up old chats just by typing in keywords or topics.</p><p>Even with all the updates, Gemini still treats tablets and foldables like oversized phones. It’s the same cramped layout, just awkwardly stretched across a big screen, with plenty of wasted space and not much thought behind it.</p><h2 id="no-more-wasted-space-2">No more wasted space</h2><p>That long-overdue fix might finally be on the way. The folks over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-tablet-3561343/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> managed to unlock a tablet-friendly Gemini layout in the latest Google app beta (v16.20.48.sa.arm64). It looks a lot like the web version, complete with a left-hand sidebar for jumping into past chats. You’ll get to it with a hamburger menu on the side.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nz6u9iFI-7g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>On top of that, the new layout throws in handy shortcuts to start fresh chats or dig through your old ones with a quick search.</p><p>Like on the web, the new tablet setup will toss a dropdown at the top so you can flip between Gemini models without breaking a sweat. The prompt bar is also getting a makeover, showing off neat buttons for “Video,” “Search,” “Research,” and “Canvas” that make jumping into those features a breeze.</p><h2 id="full-screen-mode-ftw-2">Full-screen mode FTW</h2><p>Want to give Gemini’s text the full spotlight? Just hit the toggle to tuck away the sidebar, and you’re back to a clean, no-frills view. Since the sidebar makes digging up past Gemini chats a breeze, a lot of folks might just keep it open all the time.</p><p>Google is always testing new features and tweaks behind the scenes, so there’s still no set date for when the tablet-ready Gemini layout will drop for everyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

earbuds I've used.

The best part about open earbuds is that you still get a good sound without the buds having to go inside the ear canal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BvZLL4MfNDoyodDU2djtpK" name="Acefast AceFit Pro" alt="Acefast AceFit Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvZLL4MfNDoyodDU2djtpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, there is some sound leakage when you crank up the volume, but for the most part, those in your immediate vicinity won't be able to hear what you're listening to.

A new APK teardown has revealed that users will be able to pick from a variety of voice options even on Google Search (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-voice-search-new-voices-3561504/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, they noticed that while voice searching on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight" target="_blank"> AI Mode</a> within the Search beta app, it offered users four different voices to choose from.  Google seems to have given them "space-theme" names, Cosmo, Neso, Terra, and Cassini — each of these voices adds personality and distinction for the user.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yyJnJsttavmGtyciYEgjL" name="Google-Search-app-voice-selection" alt="Google Search could get more voice options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyJnJsttavmGtyciYEgjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While these voices were initially restricted to AI Mode on Search, it seems like the tech giant plans on expanding them to the generic voice search option on the Google app as well.</p><p>"In our latest APK teardown of the Google app (<em><strong>version 16.20.48.sa.arm64 beta</strong></em>), we have learned that you’ll also hear these same four voices when you perform a voice search through the mic icon," the website explained.</p><p>This can be spotted when using the quick access search features directly from the phone's home screen (if it's a Pixel or using the Google app's widget) or within the Google app itself.</p><p>Users could have a new range of voices for spoken search results, rather than just the single female voice that the app featured for several years. When this feature becomes available, users will be able to personalize their voice search by choosing from the four voice options.</p><p>This selection will be made in the <strong>Google app's settings</strong>,  within the <strong>"Voice"</strong> section, where a "<strong>Choose Voice"</strong> list will appear. While there are only four options for voice in search, it seems like Google is saving a good chunk of these distinct voices for Gemini Live, as you get a list of 10 voices to choose from (Vega, Ursa, Pegasus, Nova, Eclipse, Lyra, Orbit, Dipper, Capella, and Orion).</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O</a>, the tech giant discussed a ton of AI features, including opening up AI Mode to everyone in the U.S. It also made<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users"> Gemini Live</a> with camera and screen sharing free and available to everyone on Android and iOS.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the tipster, the feature seems to be inbound for the main Google app. Early code in a recent version has seemingly shown off this new feature, which will bring a new "Images" tab to the bottom options row. When first opening it, it seems Google will encourage users to engage in a little "personalization," and its style is quite familiar.</p><p>The post details a "Save ideas and get inspired" splash page, which will tell users to "pick three or more topics to get started." It's kind of like signing up for social media and being asked to choose what you're interested in, sports, technology, gaming — you get it.</p><p>For Google, it seems it will offer options like "Food & Drink," "Travel," "Nail Art," "DIY & Crafts," and more. From there, the true feed shows up, which, for now, shows large snapshots of images that fit your topics on a "For You" page. Right beneath these photos are their sources, and likely the option to visit where they're from, too.</p><p>Though it's still in the works, the tipster states they spotted evidence of a "save to collection" option.</p><h2 id="google-s-additions-changes-2">Google's Additions & Changes</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="7xcN7XsKtyZPyVLkTf7ry4" name="google-app-pinterest-like-images-topics-page" alt="A rumored photo of the "choose three or more topics" page for Google's potential "Images" tab in its main app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7xcN7XsKtyZPyVLkTf7ry4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="r4TPfBCpbPbDfSwYPWhuy4" name="google-app-pinterest-images-feed-rumor" alt="An example of Google's rumored "Images" tab, which will show a rolling feed of photos based on your interests." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r4TPfBCpbPbDfSwYPWhuy4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="280" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The bulk of Google's recent happenings have involved what's gone on during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O 2025</a>.

One major part of I/O 2025 was Material 3 Expressive, Google's upcoming next-gen design language for Android. The design is meant to be vibrant, packed full of emotion for users.</p><p>The recent leak for the Photos app showed how Google could revamp its main page Memory cards with a more "modern" design. The cards might adopt a heart-shaped cutout over your memories, with the title right above it. The app's code also showcased a "create memory" button, so users can quickly craft one without hopping into the full Memories view.</p><p>Also, considering this new supposed "Images" tab is <em>kind of </em>like a Search function, Google is looking to upgrade AI Mode with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr#:~:text=Shopping%20with%20AI%20Mode">better shopping experience</a>.

We're still expecting the Pixel 10 series to debut with the same batch of phones as the Pixel 9 series did. The rumors lean into that; however, only the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL were mentioned.</p><p>The tipster claims the base Pixel 10 could arrive in four colors: Obsidian, blue, Iris (Purple), and Limoncello (Yellow). This color array is slightly different than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9's</a> Peony (pink), Wintergreen (minty green), Porcelain (white), and Obsidian.</p><p>The remaining colors for the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are as follows:</p><ul><li>Obsidian</li><li>Green</li><li>Sterling (Grey)</li><li>Porcelain (White)</li></ul><h2 id="pixel-10-prep-2">Pixel 10 Prep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously mentioned, a rumor from 2024 suggested Google is interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">keeping four phones</a> in its lineup. The rumor supposedly discovered the codenames for the three slab phones and the next foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Rumors have continued, with the most recent one involving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-spotted-in-commercial-shoot-revealing-its-familiar-design">Pixel 10 Pro at a filming site</a>. It seems Google was caught recording the eventual commercial for the device/series, which gave us a clear look at its design.</p><p>Now, the Pixel 10 series isn't expected to sport any huge design changes, and the leaked "commercial look" kind of doubles down on that. It seems the phone will continue to feature its big camera bar, rounded corners, and flat edges/display.</p><p>Elsewhere, an Android Central exclusive indicates the Pixel 10 could be in for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">unexpected display upgrade</a>. It seems there's a chance for the series to sport a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate upgrade that would change the smartphone game for those who are affected. While this doesn't concern a huge portion of users, there's a subset of people who are deeply affected by the PWM dimming rate, often suffering from harsh headaches.</p><p>If Google brings such improvements to the Pixel 10 series, it would alleviate one problematic struggle.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The post alleges this feature will offer assessments to help runners gauge their progress so they can "level up." Supposedly, these "tests" will see whether or not runners are pushing themselves too hard when exercising.</p><p>When it comes to being more "personal," the publication says the Running Coach will provide an initial test for runners. This will involve the feature gathering as much data about you as it can in twelve minutes, while also seeing how far you've run in that same timespan.</p><p>While running, and with the Running Coach (likely) enabled, users will be given "guidance." It's unclear what this guidance could look like; however, it seems the Running Coach will offer tips on how to keep your pace so you're not expending all of your energy so soon.

There was an alleged "early preview" of the software earlier this year, which brought speculation that the Galaxy S25's Now Bar would no longer remain S25 series exclusive. The software's code reportedly stated the feature would appear on "high-end models" like Samsung's past-gen foldables: Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p><p>Moreover, the code suggests Samsung is looking to rework the UI of its Gallery and Files Manager apps.</p><p>Other rumors from early May claimed One UI 8 would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">offer a Secure Folder upgrade</a>, courtesy of Private Space.

Instead, Private Space would create an entirely new section on future Galaxy phones to store sensitive photos, videos, documents, and more.</p><p>Users would also need an entirely new PIN for this Private Space-fueled Secure Folder, enhancing its defenses.</p><p>Just recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-might-be-around-the-corner-for-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8 beta's existence</a> reportedly showed up in Samsung's members app, potentially signaling its impending rollout. It's leaving users speculating if we're right on the cusp of its arrival, considering the banner's sudden appearance in a few countries. Google is preparing to launch Android 16 in Q2 2025, so it would make sense if Samsung's beta was starting soon.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables and more, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's built with strong plastic straps that snap snugly on the side of either the Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S, and the adjustment wheel on the back makes it simple to get the right fit in seconds. It fits all the heads in my family quite well (even the kids). Plus, the top strap and back pads are both cushy and easy to remove and clean.</p><p>The real reason I love it, though, is the 10,000mAh rechargeable battery pack that magnetically attaches to the back. This thing will add <em>hours</em> to your playtime, and you can quickly recharge it with any USB-C charger you have lying around.</p><p>If you find yourself lying down while playing VR or sitting in seats with headrests (think airline seats), the BoboVR E3 Pro will be more comfortable but will cost a bit more.

PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds ship with a little USB-C dongle that the buds instantly pair to, giving you a configuration-free way to add wireless earbuds to your Quest setup.</p><p>These have a fraction of the latency of Bluetooth, making them perfect for VR. Bluetooth use isn't advisable in VR because the latency can make some people feel sick. Plus, the USB-C port on the dongle ensures that you can charge your Quest while playing, perfect for pairing with the Yoges headstrap above. The case charges the earbuds, as you would expect, so you won't have to worry about battery life.</p><p>Soundcore also makes a pair of Queset earbuds, but they're built for the slower Quest 2 and won't charge your Quest 3 at its full power, making these irreplaceable. Better yet, since the dongle is USB-C, you can plug it into any device that supports USB-C audio out, like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="79598572-ede0-494e-b7cf-922c063ce921" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension48="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1386px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:91.20%;"><img id="FkvyoccXFYjbtCTyuWg4Ug" name="PrismXR-Vega-T1-render-meta-quest-earbuds.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkvyoccXFYjbtCTyuWg4Ug.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1386" height="1264" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW" data-dimension112="79598572-ede0-494e-b7cf-922c063ce921" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension48="PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:" data-dimension25=""><strong>PrismXR Vega T1 made for VR earbuds:</strong> <del>$69.99</del><strong> $44.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Low latency, made-for-VR earbuds at an ultra-low price!

You get to decide what it does, whether that’s flipping sound modes, launching the camera in a snap, or firing up real-time AI translation.</p><p>But the real star here is OnePlus' AI Plus Mind, a new feature that feels like a supercharged screenshot tool. Instead of dumping everything into your photo gallery like digital clutter, it saves and organizes on-screen information in Mind Space.</p><p>Ever snap a quick picture of a flyer or booking information, only to have it get buried in your photo mess? That’s where AI Plus Mind steps in. Just hit the Plus Key or swipe with three fingers, and it grabs all the key details like dates and spots, so you can actually find it when you need it. Plus, later this year, it’ll start sorting everything for you automatically.</p><p>In the future, AI Plus Mind will go live for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> series and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> via a software update.

If you're in India, get ready for "AI VoiceScribe," which will record, summarize, and even translate calls and meetings right within your messaging and video apps. However, VoiceScribe is not coming to the EU and North America at this time.</p><p>The OnePlus 13s will also offer "AI Call Assistant" for automatic call summaries or real-time translation during calls.</p><p>For everyone, there's a new "AI Translation" app that brings all translation features (text, voice, camera, screen) into one spot. Plus, "AI Search" is getting an upgrade, letting you use everyday language to search your local files, notes, and calendars, working hand-in-hand with AI Plus Mind for efficient searches.</p><p>Photo buffs will appreciate "AI Reframe," which intelligently analyzes your photos and suggests creative framing options. And if you've ever taken a group photo where someone's blinking, "AI Best Face 2.0" (coming this summer) can fix closed eyes and awkward expressions in group shots with up to 20 people, even if the photo wasn't taken on a OnePlus phone.</p><h2 id="google-gemini-is-joining-the-party-2">Google Gemini is joining the party</h2><p>OnePlus is also playing nice with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. Soon, Gemini will be integrated across OxygenOS apps like OnePlus Notes and Clock, as well as Google's own apps, for a more seamless AI experience. You'll even be able to use "Gemini Live" with your camera and screen sharing to have real-time conversations about what you're seeing on your phone or through your camera.</p><p>Of course, there's the inevitable privacy conversation. OnePlus claims sensitive data stays on-device or gets processed in its Private Computing Cloud—a supposedly locked-down system even they can't access.</p><p>What stands out here is that OnePlus seems to be focusing on AI features that solve actual problems rather than just checking boxes. The Plus Key and AI Plus Mind in particular feel like thoughtful attempts to make your phone work smarter for you. Now if only OnePlus would stop making the best features region-exclusive.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Joining this is something to help the 6.7-inch display: Corning Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><p>This enhancement lends its strength to better protect the display from scratches and impacts.</p><p>The back of the Moto Edge 2025 sports a stylish soft leather finish, which is where another key bit of information dwells.</p><h2 id="cameras-moto-ai-2">Cameras & Moto AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="ckWSKBkivzPzViAR6cwKNR" name="motorola-edge-2025-camera-array-example" alt="A model holds the new Edge 2025 against their body." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckWSKBkivzPzViAR6cwKNR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Edge features a triple rear camera array with a lead-off 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C primary camera. Motorola calls this its most "capable" camera array yet. With the Sony LYTIA sensor, the post states users can take more "vibrant" and "bright" shots in low-light scenarios. Joining this main sensor is the Edge's 50MP ultrawide with Macro Vision built in.</p><p>Macro Vision enables users to take shots up to 2.5cm away from their target with clarity.

The suite brings its Photo Enhancement Engine to the triple camera array to "reduce noise, accentuate details, and improve dynamic range." Additionally, Moto AI lives right in the Edge 2025's new AI Key.</p><p>Pressing this key will surface features like "Next Move," which can give intelligent suggestions based on what's on your screen.

That was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, a value flagship that has Qualcomm's latest silicon and decent cameras that undercuts the likes of the Galaxy S25 by a significant amount.</p><p>With the Neo 10, iQOO is looking to do the same thing in the mid-range category. The phone marks the debut of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 platform, and it comes with a massive 7,000mAh silicon-carbon battery — made possible by the latest innovations in battery tech — and it has an AMOLED panel that goes up to 144Hz in select use cases.</p><p>Although iQOO introduced the Neo 10 in China at the end of last year, the model that's releasing globally is markedly different; it has a new design, uses Qualcomm's latest silicon, and has a bigger battery. I'm not entirely sure why iQOO didn't use another name with the device, because it doesn't really have any similarities to the Chinese model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iCoGH4AWdSMyLkBWfkTA6Q" name="iqoo-neo-10-3" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCoGH4AWdSMyLkBWfkTA6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The global variant of the Neo 10 is now available in India, which is iQOO's biggest overseas market. The phone is sold in several storage configurations, including 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, 12GB/256GB, 12GB/512GB, and 16GB/512GB. As is the case with most brands, not all storage models will be available in all countries, but iQOO is bringing all four models to India, with the base 8GB/128GB edition debuting at just ₹29,999 ($352).</p><p>The 8GB/256GB variant is listed at ₹31,999 ($375), the 12GB/256GB model is available for ₹33,999 ($399), and the 16GB/512GB edition is ₹38,999 ($457). Coming in at the equivalent of $399 in other Asian markets, the Neo 10 is an clearly aiming to consolidate its position as the go-to gaming phone in the mid-range category. Having used the phone for just under a month, I can unequivocally say that this is one of the best all-round packages available at the moment.</p><h2 id="iqoo-nailed-the-design-brief-2">iQOO nailed the design brief</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-1" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As always, let's start with the design. The iQOO Neo 10 looks nearly identical to the iQOO 13 thanks to a squarish camera module at the back and similar design aesthetic. The phone has a flat design — like every other device in this category — but there are decent bevels at the edges, and that makes holding and using it much more comfortable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KNZPJ7RwPAhP3AxqoMZyDQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-7" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KNZPJ7RwPAhP3AxqoMZyDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although the design isn't that different to what the brand used in the past, it still looks good in its own right, and if you're getting a vibrant color variant — the phone is available in orange — it will stand out. The phone gets IP65 ingress protection, and that is decent enough in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fn9psvzXGgRs3c7kpcQF7Q" name="iqoo-neo-10-6" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fn9psvzXGgRs3c7kpcQF7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>iQOO retained the same 6.78-inch panel as the Chinese model, and it comes with AMOLED tech, 144Hz refresh, and good brightness levels. I didn't see any problems using the phone outdoors, and iQOO did a good job with color balance out of the box. Like all other Vivo and iQOO phones, you get a decent amount of customizability with regards to adjusting the colors according to your tastes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="z9yg3qSwoPWET8yRXGvXbQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-12" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9yg3qSwoPWET8yRXGvXbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone is particularly well-suited to gaming; it manages to run select games at 120fps and even 144fps, and there's a clear difference in this area. Onboard sound is quite decent too, and the stereo channels deliver a clean and detailed sound.</p><h2 id="the-neo-10-is-a-beast-of-a-gaming-phone-2">The Neo 10 is a beast of a gaming phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XpyRAcryp3TDbJFqqvwhSQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-14" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpyRAcryp3TDbJFqqvwhSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most mid-range phones now use MediaTek's Dimensity platforms as standard, and it's clear Qualcomm wanted to change that dynamic with the introduction of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The chipset sees a Cortex X4 in addition to seven A720 cores clocked at 2.0GHz to 3.3GHz, and it comes with an Adreno 825.</p><p>The result is that the Neo 10 is one of the fastest mid-range phones you can buy today; the phone does a fantastic job with gaming, and it handles visually-intensive titles without too much of a hassle. I didn't see any issues with overheating either — which is a downside on devices like the iQOO 13.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>iQOO Neo 10</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13R</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>1988</p></td><td  ><p>2093</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6690</p></td><td  ><p>6246</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2900</p></td><td  ><p>3041</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3566</p></td><td  ><p>4550</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>21.35</p></td><td  ><p>27.25</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5131</p></td><td  ><p>8075</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>19.51</p></td><td  ><p>30.71</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In short, if you want a mid-range gaming phone, the Neo 10 is a great choice. The phone does a good job with connectivity as well, and while the vibration motor isn't quite as detailed as high-end phones, it is decent enough.</p><p>Battery life is an area where the Neo 10 has a considerable advantage over its rivals; thanks to a 7,000mAh silicon-carbon battery, the phone consistently manages to last two days between charges. Even with heavy use, I was able to get well over a day and a half worth of use before having to plug in the device.</p><p>In general, battery anxiety is a thing of the past — unless you're using the Galaxy S25 Edge — and the Neo 10 proves that we are at a point where you don't need to charge your phone every single day. There's plenty to like on the charging front too, with the phone using Vivo's 120W tech; it takes just over 44 minutes to charge the device, and that's less than most flagships.</p><p>iQOO bundles a charger in the box, and it doubles as a 100W PD charger, so you can use it with any other device. As good as the Neo 10 is at gaming, it is the battery life where the phone truly comes into its own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="a2MNXqyHm5gqBdvHsDKdhP" name="iqoo-neo-10-13" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a2MNXqyHm5gqBdvHsDKdhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone has a 50MP Sony IMX882 as the main lens, and it is joined by an 8MP GalaxyCore GC08 wide-angle camera, and a 32MP GalaxyCore GC32E selfie lens. The selfie lens is notable as it gets autofocus, and it's clear iQOO wanted to prioritize this over the auxiliary cameras at the back.</p><p>That's because the 8MP wide-angle lens is strictly average; it does a passable job in daylight situations, but it just doesn't measure up in low-light shooting conditions. You don't get a tele lens either, and that puts the Neo on the backfoot. That said, the main camera is terrific, and it delivers vibrant photos in just about any lighting scenario.</p><p>There isn't much to talk about on the software side of things; the Neo 10 comes with Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and the interface is identical to what you get on other Vivo and iQOO phones. I like the design, the UI itself is fluid, and you get extensive customizability.</p><h2 id="you-re-getting-a-phenomenal-value-2">You're getting a phenomenal value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="VeSyqZpW686PpRx2zTznVQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-11" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeSyqZpW686PpRx2zTznVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like every other brand, iQOO is dabbling in AI-assisted utilities, but it isn't going quite as overboard when it comes to pushing these services constantly — unlike Samsung. The phone will get four Android OS updates, and again, that is in line with other devices in this category.</p><p>With the Neo 10, iQOO is showing that it knows how to deliver an all-rounder that excels at gaming and battery life. Outside of the average auxiliary camera, I don't really have any negatives to point out, and that alone shows just how good this phone is — iQOO ticked all the right boxes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While it didn’t happen, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/an-open-letter-to-the-fairphone-community/118760">released a blog post</a> apologizing to its consumers, explaining the current scenario and the reasons for the delay.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE" name="fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>“We know this one has been especially frustrating, and we’re sorry for the long wait times many of you have faced.

It starts with Fairphone 4, as the firm assures that it hasn’t abandoned it. With the Android 14 update significantly delayed, the company now wants to shift its focus directly onto the next iteration, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>“After thoroughly evaluating what it would take to deliver a stable Android 14 update, we’ve made the difficult decision to shift our focus directly to Android 15.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="R3Mk6dJu8qh9PLboKDFfiF" name="Android-15-through-pixel-9-case" alt="Looking through a Pixel 9 Pro XL Thinborne case at an Android 15 logo on a Pixel 8 Pro's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3Mk6dJu8qh9PLboKDFfiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fairphone notes that it is “actively working on bringing Android 15” to the Fairphone 4 and will be keeping its users posted on a regular basis. While it is a notable step in the right direction, the company isn’t giving users a fixed timeline on when to expect the Android 15 update on the handset as certain things aren’t yet under its control. For now, true Fairphone enthusiasts should keep their hopes intact as they can expect the company is now dedicated to bringing in the next iteration update as early as possible.</p><p>Till then, users are further recommended to get on the forum for all the latest developments from the company, as the team promises to be more present, and users can expect prompt responses and updates.</p><p>“Even if it’s just a small check-in or an update that says “still working on it,” we’ll share it. We get it now: silence doesn’t help. We can do better. So that’s what we’re committing to.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>, on the other hand, released with Android 13 back in 2023 and was promised at least five OS updates and a whopping eight years of software and security updates.
