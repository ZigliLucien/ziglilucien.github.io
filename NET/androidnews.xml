The idea is to serve up an information-packed lock screen that keeps real-time updates front and center.</p><p>Currently, your Pixel gives you two flavors of At a Glance. There’s the standard version from the Google app, which is the same one you’ll see on plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Then there’s the Pixel-only version baked into the Pixel Launcher, which dishes out smart, context-aware info across various categories.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-gemini-space-leak-3569136/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> could be getting a big At a Glance makeover, possibly rebranded as Gemini Space.</p><h2 id="finance-and-sports-at-your-fingertips-2">Finance and sports, at your fingertips</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX" name="pixel-6-at-a-glance-widget-lifestyle.jpg" alt="At A Glance widget on Google Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3357" height="1887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new version is supposed to go beyond weather and calendar information, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-at-a-glance-widget-could-help-you-follow-sports-scores-on-your-pixel">adding things like live sports scores</a> and finance updates right to your lock screen, making it way more useful at a glance.</p><p>Hints of this new feature first popped up in last month’s Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, where a system config file called "Ambient Data" was spotted. And since it showed up in both Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro firmware, it looks like this upgrade won’t be limited to just the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.70%;"><img id="6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn" name="Gemini-Space-reference-on-a-Pixel-phone" alt="gemini space reference in the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 release" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="277" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some extra digging turned up clues about something called an "Ambience Hub."

Digging through its code reveals direct mentions of Gemini Space, along with clear support for showing things like finance recaps and sports updates.</p><p>Interestingly, the Pixel Launcher’s At a Glance widget is supposedly getting those finance recaps and sports updates. Recent code <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/piel-at-a-glance-sports-finance/" target="_blank">spotted</a> in the Android System Intelligence app points to two Pixel-only upgrades in the works—Finance Recap for quick market snapshots and Sports, a long-brewing feature that’s finally getting ready to drop.</p><p>That said, Rahman makes it clear this is still just an informed guess, meaning there’s always a chance Gemini Space ends up being something completely different.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will the Galaxy Watch 4 receive the stable version eventually, or is it stuck with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>? The answer to that question will be an important one for Wear OS as a whole.</p><p>Samsung has promised "four years of major updates" in press releases since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> launched back in summer 2021 with Wear OS 3.

This December would fall outside the Galaxy Watch 4's four-year window.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CfiRrhScidivGNY8ETyKC7" name="Google-pixel-watch-update-battery-low.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch software update low battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfiRrhScidivGNY8ETyKC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Pixel Watch 1 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google, meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779?hl=en-NA">promises</a> "at least three years" of updates for its Pixel Watches, "from when the device first became available on the Google Store," which takes the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> to October 2025.</p><p>Google is speedier than Samsung at delivering version updates to last-gen models, so Wear OS 6 in October is very possible. But Google didn't promise years of "major" updates like Samsung did. It could run out the clock with Watch 1 security updates.</p><p>We can only extrapolate so much from a single Samsung beta software announcement. But later this year, the ambiguity will be cleared up and we'll know exactly how long Wear OS watches stay at the cutting edge of software tricks. And whether they get two, three, or four OS updates, we'll have to decide if that's enough.</p><h2 id="do-wear-os-watches-need-to-live-up-to-apple-watches-for-longevity-2">Do Wear OS watches need to live up to Apple Watches for longevity?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNLeBpvfqK69BVWAZTF4dC" name="Apple-Watch-Series-6-apps" alt="The Apple Watch Series 6 sitting above a felt floor with colorful blocks surrounding it, the display showing a collection of app icons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNLeBpvfqK69BVWAZTF4dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Apple Watch Series 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Later this year, the 2020 Apple Watch Series 6 will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/watchos-26-wear-os-6-are-taking-different-approaches-to-same-problems">watchOS 26</a>. That should be the final major update, though Apple may offer the occasional major security patch. So how should 2021 Galaxy Watch 4 or 2022 Pixel Watch buyers feel?</p><p>Apple's unspoken five-year commitment to watches is rare. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> are known for their longevity, but new features usually taper off after one or two years — and some fitness watches are stuck with the features advertised at launch.</p><p>As with its phones, Apple produces its watch silicon, making it easier to design features to work across generations because it controls the architecture. But since Samsung makes its own Exynos chips for Galaxy Watches, you'd think they'd get the same benefits.</p><p>Considering you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-affordable-galaxy-a16-5g-just-dropped-and-yet-its-already-17-percent-off-at-amazon">Galaxy A16 5G</a> for $100 less than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and get six years of OS updates, it's not a matter of watches being too cheap to <em>deserve</em> support.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-march-2025-update" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf, showing the update screen: "Your watch is up to date; Android version: 15; Android security update: March 5, 2025"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even a cheap phone will have 3–4X the RAM and three or four more ARM Cortex cores than your typical smartwatch SoC. Samsung has more headroom and better thermal solutions with the A16 than a Galaxy Watch optimized for max battery life. And any new Wear OS feature added could imbalance the entire system.</p><p>Just in the past year, we've seen how Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll back Wear OS 5</a> and then fix major bugs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">Wear OS 5.1</a>. Google <em>wants</em> to refresh its watches with new features at a quarterly cadence, but has trouble executing.</p><p>Maybe once Qualcomm delivers its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a> or Pixel Watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">switch to RISC-V</a>, they'll have the capacity to last longer. Plus, cutting off the Pixel Watch's 2018 Exynos 9110 chip frees Google to get more ambitious with Wear OS 6, making new buyers happier but leaving original customers in the lurch.</p><h2 id="do-you-care-how-long-your-wear-os-watch-lasts-2">Do you care how long your Wear OS watch lasts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-colorful-watch-faces" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting beside the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on a brown table, both with colorful watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a full spectrum of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in terms of software support. Mobvoi watches are still on Wear OS 4 and lack Google Assistant; OnePlus promises two OS updates and three years of security, but takes a year longer than Google to deliver to last-gen watches; and then there's Google and Samsung leading the charge.</p><p>Frankly, any smartwatch from 2022 or earlier will have significant downgrades from current models in terms of display quality, health sensors, and performance speed. So should customers be <em>expected</em> to upgrade so that Samsung and Google can evolve past old tech, or should they <em>expect</em> the right to get new features for four years?</p><p>As someone who usually gets the latest watch tech every year, I'm spoiled with instant access to new features, and therefore expect them. So I'm curious how much you (the reader) care about these updates.</p><p>Would you be upset if your Galaxy Watch 4 couldn't access Vascular Load, Running Coach, Antioxidant Index, and other tools from One UI 8 Watch? Or if your Pixel Watch 1 didn't get Material 3 Expressive, third-party watch face apps, dynamic theming, and battery optimizations from Wear OS 6?</p><p>Or are you okay with the expectation that you'll need to upgrade to a new watch every 2–3 years for major UI upgrades or Gemini?</p> ]]></dc:content>

While it didn't get into the dimensions of the device, when they placed the Z Flip 6 next to the alleged Z Flip 7 render, the latter looked "substantially thinner."

According to Pak, the Korean OEM is reportedly planning on "exploring" premium subscription models for "advanced coaching features."</p><p>This all stems from Samsung's new outlook toward our health and how we can stay on top of it, regardless of how busy life gets. Pak told the publication, "There's illness, there's cancer, and so many other conditions that are actually preventable." Pak adds, "...our mission is to meet people where they are and help support those healthy behaviors in a meaningful way."</p><p>Moreover, Pak stated the features Samsung is working on with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watches</a> and its health software are designed to "really contextualize it (nutrition, stress, etc.) for the user."</p><p>It's unclear just how much these subscription models could cost users, especially without knowing if Samsung will offer multiple tiers, too.

Instead, what consumers will find on the Phone 3 will be Nothing's new Glyph Matrix lighting system, which it's confirming again today; however, it comes with more insight. From the clip shared, it seems Nothing is implementing its new lighting system on the top right corner of the device's back.</p><p>The clip shows the matrix system working with a strobbing design effect.</p><p>Nothing's tagline reads, "When light becomes language." While its teaser only shows a cool design, it's possible this matrix system will offer information without looking at your screen.

It said, "We killed the Glyph Interface" with some theatrics sprinkled in for good measure.

Typically helmed by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, this week's entry is a guest post from Michael Hicks, another Android Central Senior Editor who regularly covers all things XR.</p></div></div><p>After a week at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">Augmented World Expo 2025</a>, writing about cool prototypes and lofty promises about XR's future, I've hijacked Nick Sutrich's weekly VR column to hype up the one thing from AWE that I'm excited about <strong>right now</strong>: gaming and streaming on AR glasses.</p><p>Google and Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-google-described-conflicting-visions-of-ar-glasses-future-at-awe-2025">described their visions for AR glasses at AWE</a>, promising all-day AI companions and stylish form factors. But even Meta admitted they likely won't break into the mainstream until the 2030s.</p><p>If we're talking about AR glasses designed for at-home use that don't need to "blend in," those are available now. However, every pair I've tested so far has felt imperfect compared to setting up shop in front of a TV or monitor.</p><p>After my AWE 2025 demos with Viture and XREAL glasses — both current models and unreleased future versions — I'm convinced that the XR display market is ready to explode, sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="ar-gaming-glasses-are-getting-better-2">AR gaming glasses are getting better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZhaXFyYLWHmvD2T4dHbuRW" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-air-2-inside" alt="Comparing Xreal One (top) and Xreal Air 2 (bottom) birdbath lens shape and size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhaXFyYLWHmvD2T4dHbuRW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My colleagues have reviewed and loved AR gaming displays like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">RayNeo Air 3S</a>. However, when Nick sent me his XREAL Air 2s last year, I enjoyed the novelty but found them to be fairly unengaging.</p><p>I appreciated how light they were compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> for XR content. Plugging them into my Steam Deck and getting an instant AR display for gaming felt awesome, and it helped me avoid my terrible gamer posture by leaning back with my console in my lap.</p><p>That didn't eliminate my usual complaints with XR glasses I've tried at conventions: the 46º field of view (FoV), FHD resolution, and 500 nits of brightness all add up to a <em>normal</em> viewing experience, not a transformative one.</p><p>XREAL advertises a 130-inch display experience on the Air 2, but in my experience, it feels closer to a large gaming monitor or a mid-sized TV with a fast refresh rate, but pedestrian visuals, and more eye strain. They're great for travel, but I'm too much of a homebody for this use case to apply often.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fUGWMwbPWqgZjAFYJzSonh" name="xreal-one-pro-with-xreal-eye-03" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses with an Xreal Eye camera attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fUGWMwbPWqgZjAFYJzSonh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, at AWE 2025, I had the opportunity to try out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">XREAL One Pro glasses</a> at their booth. I'd <em>hoped</em> for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">Project Aura</a> demo, but the Pros were a wonderful silver lining with their 57-degree display and boosted brightness.</p><p>Driving around the world of Forza Horizon 4 with the Pros and a handheld console, I felt much more immersed than before. My Air 2 display at home feels like a shiny postage stamp stuck in my visual center, while the wider Pro display hugs the edge of my vision compellingly.</p><p>With its 3DoF support, I can anchor the display, making it easier to look away from the game to talk to someone or check my phone, or else angle the display if I want to look slightly up or down. That kind of flexibility makes me more likely to want to wear them, without feeling as closed off from my surroundings as I do in VR.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed" name="Viture-XR-Pro-Glasses-and-Switch-2" alt="The Nintendo Switch 2 sitting on a table with Viture Pro XR glasses sitting above it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also tried Viture's next-generation AR glasses at AWE 2025, including one display so experimental that it wasn't even attached to glasses yet. Viture doesn't want me giving any specifics yet (except to "tease" readers), but it's no secret that they turned my skeptical perspective on AR displays into excitement.</p><p>Viture's current Pros also measure 46 degrees with FHD resolution, but I appreciate the straightforward "myopia adjustment" slider on top to solve for my left eye's nearsightedness. That way, I don't need to commit to a specific prescription, then have my eyes get worse a year or two from now; plus, it doesn't lock out my fiancée or anyone else from using them.</p><p>Without specifics, Viture's next-gen glasses make significant improvements in areas like FoV and display quality, which make them feel <em>worth</em> the 80g of weight resting on my nose and ears. And other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> brands are likely to keep pace, making them more competitive as true TV or monitor replacements.</p><h2 id="still-a-ways-to-go-for-ar-displays-but-we-re-close-2">Still a ways to go for AR displays, but we're close</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At AWE 2025, XREAL's Ralph Jodice talked about the pressure from customers to "make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller." Right now, brands like XREAL, Viture, Rokid, and RayNeo are racing to offer better visuals for power users, but that comes with comfort trade-offs. I'd eventually want AR glasses that are lighter than my Air 2s but with the visual quality of the heavier Pros.</p><p>As I noted before, anchored displays will benefit any gaming glasses, but that requires camera support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal Eye</a> solves this, and future glasses may have that camera built in from the get-go.</p><p>But that, combined with brighter, high-res displays, could make AR glasses a major battery drain on your phone or console, especially since they require the USB-C port you'd normally use for charging during long gaming sessions. So efficiency will be important, on top of comfort.</p><p>Next, aside from myopia correction, AR glasses need to do more to accommodate different interpupillary distances (IPD), so you're not straining or cross-eyed using them. Rokid just announced that its new AR Spatial glasses pack will add software IPD adjustments to target 53mm to 75mm, which sounds promising.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi" name="xreal-one-lenses-inside-02" alt="Xreal One smart display glasses showing a Windows desktop on its displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All together, AR glasses will remain a niche category while companies figure out these fundamental issues. However, the visual upgrades will be impressive enough that more people will be willing to live with the trade-offs. They just need a chance to break out of the tech niche.</p><p>I suspect that will happen as we see more non-AR glasses in store displays, like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">Oakley Meta glasses</a>. Best Buy or Target could group some AR glasses in the same category, letting people try out these 100-inch AR displays and decide whether they want to spend thousands more on an OLED TV.</p><p>We may still be years off from AR glasses becoming "mainstream," but the tech in these devices is reaching the point that they're starting to live up to AR's potential.

According to Akis Evangelidis, the Nothing Phone 3 will allegedly provide consumers with five years of Android OS updates and seven years of security updates.</p><p>What's unclear early on is how often these security updates will arrive for users. Nothing's Phone 2 experienced bi-monthly updates, and it seems it's doing the same for the latest 3a series. Considering Nothing's really pushing the "flagship" status of the Phone 3, it would be nice to see security updates every month, but we'll have to see what happens.</p><p>Moreover, the extended duration of major Android OS upgrades, which should take consumers into 2030 before that's done with. This is a major shift from the Phone 2's three-year Android OS promise (with four years of security updates).

The chip is said to bring an 88% increase in GPU, a 33% increase in CPU power, and a 125% boost in its NPU.</p><p>Just yesterday (June 17), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-grabs-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-upcoming-flagship-phone-3">Nothing confirmed</a> that the Phone 3 will rock Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 SoC. The company's CEO, Carl Pei, followed this up in a YouTube video, stating the Phone 3 will essentially blow its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, out of the water. Not only are the phone's cameras said to see a wild boost, but its performance should step it up considerably, as well.</p><p>In practice, Pei said the Phone 3 should feel a lot "snappier" when in use. Some users may wonder why Nothing is opting for the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead of something else. Pei states he wanted to give users a "balanced experience" with a chip that could handle everything had "gotten better" inside the Phone 3.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 (and the Headphone 1) are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-sets-a-date-for-its-phone-3-launch-and-its-not-too-far-away">set to debut</a> on July 1 in London.

Both products help complete the Xreal One product line and deliver a fuller vision of what we can expect from the company in the future.</p><p>Earlier this year, Xreal debuted its next-generation smart display glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, which debuted the first-ever on-glasses chip that enables 3DoF tracking with no additional software or configuration. Meanwhile, the tiny new Xreal Eye camera upgrades this tracking to 6DoF, or the equivalent of what a VR headset like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> can deliver. In short, that means you can walk around, and your floating virtual monitor stays in place.</p><p>Xreal One Pro, on the other hand, is a new upgraded set of glasses that runs roughly $100 more than Xreal One. Upgrading gets you a newer Sony micro-OLED that's 100 nits brighter, a notably thinner prism display that eliminates the glare of birdbath optics, a 7-degree larger field of view (FoV), and a new interchangeable frame for an added style bonus.</p><h2 id="price-and-availability-2">Price and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hp9PaJpyTanmT9ZWcSvFLA" name="xreal-eye-in-box" alt="The Xreal Eye camera in its box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hp9PaJpyTanmT9ZWcSvFLA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Eye retails for $99 and requires a pair of Xreal One or Xreal One Pro glasses to work. You can get the Eye camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-eye">at xreal.com</a> starting July 1, while availability on Amazon and Bestbuy.com is slated for mid-July. Physical stores should start carrying Xreal Eye later in July.</p><p>Xreal One Pro starts at $599/€649/£549 for preorder customers, but pricing rises to $649/€689/£579 as of retail availability on July 1. Customers can still get the early bird pricing by ordering before June 30 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-one-pro">at xreal.com</a>.

Xreal Eye might seem like a superfluous add-on at first, but its modular design solves a real problem in a great way. If someone around you doesn't like the camera on your glasses, you can simply <em>remove it</em>.</p><p>Installation is as simple as possible. Remove the rubber covering from the underside of the glasses' nose bridge, then slide the camera in. It'll automatically recognize the camera, although you may need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xreal.com/support/update/">update your glasses' firmware</a> to get all the nifty new features.</p><p>Xreal Eye enables enhanced spatial anchor functionality, which means that the floating virtual monitor it normally displays does an even better job of staying in place. With the default 3DoF tracking, Xreal One and Xreal One Pro allow you to turn your head and move in place a bit, but moving back and forth or getting up and walking around while wearing the glasses will result in the display changing position.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA" name="xreal-eye-installed-on-xreal-one-glasses-01" alt="The Xreal Eye camera installed in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jWxiRJjUMyQ3WqwuQi5CKA" name="xreal-eye-installation" alt="Installing the Xreal Eye camera in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWxiRJjUMyQ3WqwuQi5CKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dMUkyM7tP7gwSJkz4NyHnh" name="xreal-one-pro-with-xreal-eye-02" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses with an Xreal Eye camera attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMUkyM7tP7gwSJkz4NyHnh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With Xreal Eye, that virtual screen stays put even if you get up and walk around.

At the very least, this is a compelling alternative that also provides a visual viewfinder for photos and video, plus a built-in display for reviewing things.</p><h2 id="xreal-one-pro-2">Xreal One Pro</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WdFV7gC5XBVUxfynvuWJnh" name="xreal-one-pro-with-xreal-eye-01" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses with an Xreal Eye camera attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WdFV7gC5XBVUxfynvuWJnh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest glasses from Xreal are an upgrade over Xreal One in some palpable ways. While they're a few grams heavier, Xreal One Pro is the first pair of smart display glasses I've used with a prism lens system. This new prism lens is notably smaller than any pair of glasses that use birdbath optics, which is to say, every other commercially available pair on the market.</p><p>This means the glasses sit slightly closer to your face and are physically more compact, as well. You can see the difference from the case alone, which is a bit smaller than the one that ships with Xreal One.</p><p>Holding the glasses up next to each other makes the difference incredibly noticeable. The entire top portion of the glasses is significantly shallower and smaller, and the optics themselves are completely flat inside the frame, while birdbath optics sit at a downward angle.</p><div

positive side effect this flat design has is glare reduction. I'm sitting poolside wearing the glasses while working on my laptop, sun blaring around the umbrella I'm sitting under. Not only is it easy to see the display — it's plenty bright and the electrochromic film adds a layer of tinting to offset the light — but there's no reflection from the bright pavement below me.</p><p>Reflection is one of the biggest issues people have had with birdbath optics, particularly if you wear lighter clothing, so this is a great fix. I also feel like the prism lens helps even out the extreme brightness from the display. Bright whites at max brightness on Xreal One can almost be painful at times, but they're more evened out and less extreme on Xreal One Pro.</p><p>Xreal says the FoV on these glasses is seven degrees larger than Xreal One, but I have a hard time spotting this. If anything, it seems like Xreal One Pro's prism lenses are slightly wider than Xreal One, which is likely where the difference comes in. Plus, there's no lens distortion at the edges of the frame anymore. It's more of a gradual fade as the image tapers off the side.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:88.87%;"><img id="5M7Gd2bzbkYhAx7hf5qreP" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-one-pro-glasses-distance" alt="Comparing the depth of Xreal One and Xreal One Pro glasses while wearing them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5M7Gd2bzbkYhAx7hf5qreP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the physical changes, Xreal One Pro is just as easy to use as Xreal One.

Next-gen prism lenses, the widest FoV of any available smart glasses, and 6DoF tracking are simply hard to beat, especially since you don't need any additional software to enjoy any of the glasses' best features.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bc256708-7d59-4139-96e1-70aca059e78e">            <a href="https://www.xreal.com/one-pro" data-model-name="Xreal One Pro"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRYERoB2EQef6DsP8dCh9m.jpg' alt="An official render of Xreal One Pro glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Xreal One Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Xreal One Pro represents the best tech in smart display glasses you can find today.

We've heard tipsters claiming it could take place in mid-July, while some say early July. The most recent rumor suggests that the summer Unpacked event will allegedly take place on July 9 at 10 am ET.</p><p>This leak comes from prominent tipster Evan Blass, who took to X to post the event's details, with just a one-liner. But didn't reveal much about where the event is slated to take place. Considering earlier rumors suggested that Samsung could be launching its next foldable line-up in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> New York after three years. </a></p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next Galaxy Unpacked: 9 July 2025 @ 10AM EDT<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1935396700908409256">June 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>That said, the Korean OEM is expected to launch the next set of foldables: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Z Flip 7</a> during the event. Speaking of foldables, Samsung has been heavily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-ai-camera-with-situational-awareness-for-galaxy-z-fold-7-ultra">teasing</a> a supposed "ultra-thin" foldable that could launch during this Galaxy Unpacked. While it may not hold the Ultra in its name, Samsung could be promising an Ultra-like experience with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>As of now, all we know is that Samsung is calling this device "The next chapter of Ultra." It said that the Ultra experience goes beyond just feature upgrades, but will also customize the form factor of the device, making it smaller and more easily portable. Hinting at the device's cameras, the company said it will have a new intelligent camera system that can be more intuitive and understand what users are shooting and adjust itself to match any situation.</p><p>“As AI evolves from text-based prompts to multimodal understanding, Galaxy devices are becoming smarter — able to get what you’re looking at and respond to situations. The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="NZvkbMmCcn8auY8NrtoDui" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-teaser-02" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NZvkbMmCcn8auY8NrtoDui.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several rumors also suggest that  Samsung will drop its newest wearables lineup, aka the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>,  which will allegedly show up as a trio this year, comprising the Galaxy Watch 8, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025).</p><p>Furthermore, a Korean news site suggested earlier today (June 18) that Samsung could also drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsungs-xr-headset-could-finally-launch-in-september">teasers of its first-ever XR headset</a>, also called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, that was showcased recently at Google I/O.</p><p>Last year, Samsung unveiled its foldable phones in Paris on July 10th, and we anticipate this year's event could follow a similar timeline. However, it is important to note that Samsung has not officially announced its Unpacked event yet.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Indeed, if you&apos;re looking to spend 350 bucks on a smartphone, nothing really beats the Edge Plus (2023) right now. </p><p>The only real problem is that the Moto Edge Plus (2023) was only guaranteed four years of software support, which means it won&apos;t receive any OS upgrades after Android 16 or security patches after 2027. Whether or not that&apos;s a dealbreaker is up to you, but if you just want a cheap, great-looking phone today, the Edge Plus (2023) is an outstanding pick. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Not only did Mohan claim "the possibilities with AI are limitless," but he states, "creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream."</p><p>YouTube feels that AI tools for video can help usher its creators' creativity into a new era.

The company highlighted the device in a press release, adding that the band can run for seven nights on a single full charge. Garmin's vice president of consumer sales and marketing, Susan Lyman, said, "Wearing this smart sleep band every night can provide in-depth sleep insights and a more complete picture of fitness and recovery."</p><p>Users will find similar functions with the smart band as they would with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. The post highlights the band's ability to capture your sleep data, such as sleep stages (light, deep, REM) and HRV status. The next morning, Garmin says your Index Sleep Monitor will upload its sleep data to provide you with a Sleep Score, ranging between zero and 100.</p><p>Sleep functions continue with Pulse Ox. Garmin says the sleep band can even track and calculate your blood oxygen saturation throughout the night.</p><p>Moreover, the company worked in Breathing variations and Respiration data. The former partners with Pulse Ox, so users can "better understand shifts in breathing patterns." The latter gives you information on any changes in your breathing rates while you were sleeping.</p><h2 id="garmin-s-health-focus-evolves-2">Garmin's Health-focus Evolves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:910px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.93%;"><img id="ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S" name="garmin-index-sleep-monitor-band-example" alt="A model is wearing the Garmin Index Sleep Monitor on her right arm while she sleeps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="910" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another major part of this Garmin smart sleep band is its tracking capabilities for women's health. Garmin states the Index Sleep Monitor will leverage a woman's skin temperature to provide insightful menstrual cycle estimations and information. Additionally, the device can help women keep track of their pregnancy, as well as provide exercise and nutrition assistance.</p><p>Aside from menstrual tracking, the sleep band's skin temperature readings can assist users with early signs of "potential illness" and other changes to their sleep environment that might've affected them.</p><p>Stress tracking throughout the night is available, and "Body Battery energy monitoring." With this, Garmin says the band will inform the wearer if they should take the day easier, meaning get some more rest. Garmin recommends wearing one of its compatible smartwatches, which will further the Body Battery feature to give you a "complete" picture of whether you should push yourself or take it easy.</p><p>The Garmin Index Sleep Monitor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1650098/">is available now</a> for $169.99 in Small and Medium, as well as Large and Extra Large sizes.

But even though Google didn't "announce" anything at AWE, I learned a lot about its strategy to rely on partners like Samsung, Qualcomm, and Unity to court skeptical developers.</p><p>Here's every tidbit I gleaned from my AWE 2025 event about Android XR!</p><h2 id="an-android-xr-recruiting-blitz-for-devs-2">An Android XR recruiting blitz for devs</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lowVrEFOsV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"Google has been working in the glasses space for 10 years, and we have not stopped." Google has been using that line since it announced Android XR last year, and Payne brought it out again at AWE. Google <em>really</em> wants to reassure us that the deaths of Google Glass and Daydream were exaggerated and that Android XR won't end up in the Graveyard.</p><p>Payne, who leads Google's XR product management team, said that despite "massive strides forward in both hardware and software," the true "inflection point" for XR has been the rise of multimodal AI and LLMs. They're pushing Gemini as the glue across all VR/AR headsets and smart glasses, and reassuring developers that they can access Gemini to simplify their own XR apps.</p><p>"AI will do for XR products what the touchscreen did for smartphones," Payne argued. And since devs can access the Gemini API through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?api=dev">Firebase AI Logic SDK</a>, they may be tempted to join Android XR and experiment with multimodal AI for their apps.</p><p>You can currently only code Android XR apps for VR headsets like Moohan, but Google will open up software for smart glasses "later this year," and it's also working with Samsung and glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">designers like Warby Parker</a> to "ship the first set of smart glasses soon."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3RKYVmC39UzAdraZPJ8DFZ" name="Android-XR-AWE-2025-perception-stack" alt="Google's Hugo Swart on stage at AWE 2025 discussing Android XR's "Powerful Perception Stack."

Devs can create one app with one SDK that'll port to headsets and glasses, saving them development time.</p><p>Plus, Google is "deeply integrating and optimizing our code to Snapdragon," so that Android XR works natively on chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomms-new-on-device-ai-chip-could-change-smart-glasses-forever">Snapdragon AR1+</a> that support on-device AI for smart glasses.

But after Android XR was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ignored-android-xr-at-gdc-2025-and-indie-vr-devs-are-concerned">no-show at GDC 2025</a>, I wondered what Google's plan was to support gaming devs on its new platform.</p><p>It turns out many of the biggest VR game devs like Owlchemy Labs and Resolution games have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://unity.com/blog/porting-apps-games-over-android-xr-unity-6">ported to Android XR using Unity 6</a>, which supports OpenXR input handling and a Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for graphical compatibility.</p><p>I attended an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1300">AWE panel</a> by Mirrorscape, an Android XR Early Access Program developer bringing its "Fallout Factions XR" game to Android XR later in 2025, to get insights into what it's like porting games to the platform.</p><p>The CEO, Grant Anderson, described the "godsend" of designing for a virtual space instead of a "little rectangle," aka your phone. Mirrorscape coded using Unity, which has an "AR foundation" for features like plane tracking and hand gesture recognition, while targeting the OpenXR standard behind most VR games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kAYFQpoEPEnmKHnYPeVLXJ" name="AWE-2025-Android-XR-panel-slide" alt="A screen at AWE 2025 showing "Unity & Android XR: Technical Foundation."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kAYFQpoEPEnmKHnYPeVLXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR games have elements of OpenXR, Unity, and Vulcan built into them. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Unity does its best to make the conversion to Android XR painless, he warned that "adapting to architectural changes and new rendering pipeline requirements in Unity 6 can be a heavy lift and take some time."</p><p>He also noted that "there's not a lot of Android XR headsets out there" right now, nor an emulator for virtual testing. Until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Samsung Moohan headset</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google reference AR glasses</a> become widely available, devs must build their own reference hardware to check their XR apps, which sounds challenging.</p><p>Plus, devs have to optimize for Snapdragon XR2 hardware, relying on tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/introducing-application-spacewarp/">Spacewarp</a> and foveated rendering. But Quest VR devs should find this familiar.</p><p>The last pain point he mentioned was that the Android XR SDK gets frequent updates in alpha, which can cause "package conflicts" between it and Unity without constant firmware updates. Presumably, this will become less of an issue once Android XR reaches stability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KyHktkhsr8cwRmACgLvfFJ" name="AWE-2025-android-xr-unity-toolkit" alt="A screen at AWE 2025 showing the text "Your toolkit for building on Android XR" with Showcase Samples, Unity Verified Package Support, and a URL for Android XR developer tools." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KyHktkhsr8cwRmACgLvfFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unity and Google co-hosted a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1365">AWE panel</a> on "Getting Started with Android XR Development in Unity." And according to Google project manager Ryan Bartley, you can work in-headset to update your XR game, "iterating on your work in seconds with changes from the Unity Editor appearing instantly on your headset." That sounds pretty handy!</p><p>Features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-headsets-will-take-vital-camera-option-from-android-phones">passthrough API</a>, plane detection, and hand tracking are all demonstrated through Unity packages, or "showcase samples," so that devs can apply the source code to their own games. And anyone who used the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for past XR experiences can migrate to Android XR using the compatibility plugin.</p><p>That is to say, many current VR experiences should be <em>capable</em> of a quick Android XR transition, though Unreal Engine games won't have as easy a conversion process.</p><p>I also learned that Google has held "four Android XR developer boot camps across the globe." Some Quest devs have complained about Google excluding them, so I'm curious if Google (or Samsung) will expand these boot camps or leave smaller devs to rely on Unity.</p><h2 id="counting-on-devs-to-join-android-xr-now-and-profit-later-2">Counting on devs to join Android XR now and profit later</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-7" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I attended several panels about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-google-described-conflicting-visions-of-ar-glasses-future-at-awe-2025">future of AR glasses at AWE</a> with Google and Meta execs, and Google's team is counting on devs being tempted by their open system and easy transition.</p><p>XREAL's Ralph Jodice said that anyone coding for Android XR now can be on their Project Aura headset right now, "and you should be." The idea is that devs' familiarity with Android will make the transition to Android XR easy, and once you optimize your app, it'll work across the entire "ecosystem" of devices as they arrive.</p><p>That said, Google needs to assure devs that they'll get a return on investment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-will-never-recover-from-its-stadia-debacle">Killing Stadia</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-daydream-vr-platform-finally-and-fully-dead">Daydream</a>, Cardboard, and other services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/android-xr-will-be-another-doa-google-product">has given Google a reputation</a>, which is why Swart promised during his panel that Google is "committed to investing in the ecosystem." And Samsung's involvement makes it harder for Google to pull the plug unless its Korean partner decides to give up.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other issue is that we only know of Project Moohan, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">XREAL Project Aura</a>, and a handful of other niche Android XR devices from Sony and others; none of them will be as affordable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>. As open as Android XR is, devs need assurances that enough people will buy their apps to make the transition worth it.</p><p>Meta's Kelly Ingham made that point during her smart glasses panel: their smart glasses system isn't open to people yet, but their "focus" is to "get as many devices in the market as we can" so devs can "develop an app and actually make money." It felt like a subtle jab at Android XR.</p><p>Swart promised that future Qualcomm reference devices for Android XR will be tailored "to a variety of use cases and price points" so ODMs can "balance visual quality and price." So perhaps we'll see an influx of affordable Android XR devices that go beyond elite productivity headsets.</p><p>Until then, it's hard to say whether VR and XR devs will buy into Android XR's open-platform promise or wait for more concrete hardware from Google's partners.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Even the bottom features three cutouts, one for its USB-C slot and two for its (alleged) shifted speakers.</p><p>While some cases can feel a little clunky, Thinborne states these Super Thin cases feature their "thinnest," minimalistic design. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/">Thinborne</a> also touts the grip on these thin cases that will hopefully keep you away from heartbreaking drops.</p><p>The inclusion of MagSafe technology on the case itself means users can enjoy wireless charging capabilities, if we're to expect this same range of devices for the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-series-sticks-with-four-2">The Pixel 10 series sticks with four?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-01" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-04" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-05" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-03" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Nothing is confirmed yet (of course), but it seems Thinborne is playing off a number of Pixel 10 rumors that suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">we'd see the same four phones</a> in 2025. Last September, an early Pixel 10 rumor claimed Google had already started development for the new series with the following codenames: Frankel, Blazer, Mustang, and Rango. These names concerned the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold, respectively.</p><p>At the time, designs hadn't been speculated yet; however, rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">this past winter</a> might've given us something to think about. A host of rumors from a social media tipster gave us a rumored glimpse at the Pixel 10 series, which could look exactly like the 9 series. It seems Google could stick with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">same large camera bar</a>, rounded corners, flat display, and the like.</p><p>Even the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked renders</a> suggest a phone that won't diverge much from last year's.</p><p>These are design elements Thinborne has seemingly adhered to in its early Pixel 10 case collection.</p><p>Additionally, rumors claim the base Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">could feature a triple camera setup</a>, like its higher-tier friends.

At a rumored 3.9mm thin when unfolded, it makes the 5.6mm Z Fold 6 look like a chonker. However, it also raises a few simple questions, such as: how would Samsung achieve this without making big sacrifices, particularly in the camera performance?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use.

Galaxy Z Fold phones have never had <em>bad</em> cameras, but there's never been a Z Fold that could outperform the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. This has long been a perplexing problem, given that the Z Fold costs nearly $2,000 and has never been "thin," but can Samsung really make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> thin <em>and</em> give it an award-winning camera?</p><p>Yes, absolutely, and two other ultra-thin foldables are proof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">review of the Oppo Find N5</a>, which is currently the thinnest phone in the world <em>and</em> a book style foldable like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Harish said "the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself." Even Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> with its 200MP camera sensor proves it's possible.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-big-charger-upgrade-databse-listing-rumor">the upcoming Honor Magic V5</a> is set to be the most direct competitor to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and is said to be at least as thin as Samsung's phone, I thought it would be fun to take last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and test its cameras against the best flagship cameras of 2025. The results show that Samsung can deliver a truly stunning flagship camera experience on its upcoming ultra-thin foldable if it really wants to.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-primary-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Primary cameras</span></h2><p>The Honor Magic V3 comes in at 4.4mm thin unfolded and sports a sizable camera island around back with a 50MP main sensor. Honor has impressed us with its photography prowess over the past few years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">particularly with motion capture capabilities</a>, including a powerful suite of software tricks behind it.</p><p>So we'll begin in the late spring garden, which is still full of flowers and vibrant colors.</p><div ><table><caption>Primary camera specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Phone</p></th><th  ><p>Primary camera</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.56" Sony IMX906</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.3" Omnivision OV50H</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.4" Sony LYT-808</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.3" Samsung ISOCELL HP2</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If I had to choose one main attribute to critique the Honor Magic V3's photos, it's that they're often underexposed, and the dynamic range is a bit lacking when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. All three phones use different sensors for the main camera.

It uses a lower megapixel count than the other four phones I pitted it against and, oddly enough, no one seems to know what sensor Honor used here. The company doesn't usually divulge its camera sensors, and the usual software tools I use to find out don't want to tell me, either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ultrawide camera sensor specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Phone</p></th><th  ><p>Ultrawide camera</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></td><td  ><p>40MP (sensor model and size unknown)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Honor Magic 7 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.88" Omnivision OV50D</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus 13</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.76" Samsung ISOCELL JN5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/2.5" Samsung ISOCELL JN3</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Honor Magic V3's ultrawide camera produces seriously stunning macro shots, and it's hard to tell the difference between its images and ones from the other flagship phones I tested.

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and Honor's tuning tends to lean toward cooler colors, while Samsung likes more vibrant, warm colors. I prefer Samsung's tuning in that arena, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">OnePlus 13</a> is normally quite spot on with color science on the ultrawide camera. Either way, the Magic V3 did a good job keeping up with the flagships here.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-telephoto-cameras"><span>Honor Magic V3: Telephoto cameras</span></h2><p>Telephoto cameras have gotten really interesting over the past few years.

In the 10x shots, you can tell the Magic V3's shot is slightly softer, but on its own, I doubt anyone would notice this. The telephoto camera is quite good and does a great job of zooming in on things. Like the primary camera, this one also struggles with underexposure and dynamic range at times.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="mLFyNCNF53DMMmjGCyUpFZ" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-6x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 6x with a patch of Wisteria flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLFyNCNF53DMMmjGCyUpFZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="ukg9oKZoi8YczJGGj9udaP" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-10x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Honor Magic V3 with a butterfly at 10x" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukg9oKZoi8YczJGGj9udaP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="dDSXTfgMpScUrjDsGwZq6Z" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-10x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 10x with the Biltmore Estate's facade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDSXTfgMpScUrjDsGwZq6Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="mmPMK2vCbRQbFkpjUjQDdP" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-30x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail differences between the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Honor Magic V3 with a birdhouse at 30x" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmPMK2vCbRQbFkpjUjQDdP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1945" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.41%;"><img id="JuVUiKqMnkSFGLdYXzRe5Z" name="honor-magic-v3-camera-vs-magic-7-pro-and-one-plus-13-30x-01" alt="Comparing zoom detail between the Honor Magic V3, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and OnePlus 13 at 30x with the Biltmore Estate's facade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JuVUiKqMnkSFGLdYXzRe5Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2918" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Zooming in beyond 10x is far less advisable, though.

The music streaming service initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-tests-new-spotify-like-lyrics-sharing-feature">began testing lyric sharing in April 2025</a>, but the tool is now widely rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users as of today, June 17 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's available on version 8.24 of the YouTube Music app for iOS and Android.</p><p>With lyric sharing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users can create a shareable card with a few lines of lyrics from the song they're currently listening to. When available, the feature adds a new floating action button to the Lyrics tab of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-musics-now-playing-controls-are-moved-around-in-latest-test">Now Playing user-interface</a> called <strong>Share</strong>. After tapping it, you can select which groupings of lyric lines you'd like to use to create the shareable card.</p><p>You can pick the background color of your lyric card, and continuing will create the finalized graphic. It'll show the song title, artist, album artwork, selected lyrics, and a subtle YouTube Music logo. It's essentially creating an image that can be saved to your device's camera roll or shared with other apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX" name="YouTube-Music-Lyric-Sharing" alt="The new lyric sharing feature in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the feature simply shares an image of your lyric card, you'll need to manually add audio to lyrics shared on your social accounts. For instance, if you wanted to add YouTube Music lyrics to your Instagram story, you'll still need to select a track for your story as you normally would in order for music to play. Otherwise, it'll only take a few taps to create and share a YouTube Music lyrics card.</p><p>Lyric sharing is available for both free and paid YouTube Music accounts running the latest version of the mobile app (version 8.24 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>).</p><p>The YouTube Music app was last updated yesterday, June 16, on both iOS and Android. However, this seems like a server-side change, so force stop your YouTube Music app if you aren't able to create lyric cards yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it did help to type "Adobe Firefly" to get the app to appear in the store's listings.</p><p>Joining this mobile app launch is Adobe's announcement of new image and video generative models. In its post, the company states it has partnered with ideogram, Luma, Pika, and runway.

The company's Alexandru Costin, vice president, generative AI, commented saying, "Ideating with Firefly Boards is like an AI-powered creative jam session, where creative professionals can riff across media types, explore ideas together and turn sparks of inspiration into production-ready concepts."</p><p>As such, Firefly Boards is picking up a "Generative Video" option. Thanks to Google, Luma AI, and Pika, users will find convenient text-to-video generation capabilities, which can be placed right into a Board. Additionally, users can now utilize Firefly Boards' AI to make "iterative edits" to images. This is done via simple text prompts. You tell the AI what you'd like to change and watch it come to life.</p><p>Lastly, Adobe is rolling out some QoL updates, such as one-click arrange. The post states users can now "instantly" arrange the content in their Board to be more presentable. "Linked Docs" is another feature that arrives, giving users the option to link their Adobe documents in Boards.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original poster (OP) showed the platform's latest alleged attempts to dissuade users from using ad blockers, which is to "throttle" their watching experience. The user posted a snapshot of an "Experiencing interruptions? Find out why" button that appears when clicking on a video.</p><p>Many users confirm that this interruption button only appears when they have an ad blocker active.</p><p>One user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mx6a49i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">offered their experience</a>, stating the video "takes a couple of seconds to load as if my bandwidth is insufficient." There is a small bit of "lag," you could say, from when you click on the video to when it begins. The player remains black for a few moments, as if you were waiting for a skippable ad to play through (normally). Furthering user suspicions about YouTube's motive is the "Find out why" link.</p><p>YouTube is sending users to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#zippy=%2Ccheck-your-extensions-including-ad-blockers">Google support page</a> that says interruptions might be caused by your extensions, such as an ad blocker.</p><h2 id="the-fight-against-ad-blockers-2">The Fight against Ad Blockers</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/theyre_slowing_down_performance_if_you_use_an">They're slowing down performance if you use an adblocker</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>There was some speculation that YouTube rolled out this cheeky way of combating ad-block users to accounts that typically use them. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/comment/mxcignl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">subsequent reports</a> state this tactic has since hit non-logged-in users with ad blockers enabled.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to YouTube about these slowdown reports. We will update this article if we hear back.</p><p>YouTube's been targeting ad blockers on its platform for a few years now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-loads-slower-on-firefox#section-update">and the idea of "slowdowns" or throttling attempts</a> is nothing new if it's actively doing so again. Users previously reported slower video experiences on YouTube in 2023, which the platform confirmed was part of its anti-adblock crusade. Some users thought it was restricted to a couple of browsers, but a Google update made it clear that YouTube had every browser with ad block enabled in its sights.</p><p>As always, YouTube remains consistent in its crusade's purpose, stating, "To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we’ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> for an ad free experience" back in 2023.</p><p>Users might also be familiar with another tactic YouTube deployed, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">would block streaming access to its platform</a> after its system flagged your ad blocker a few times.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, the company is ready to make the stable versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash</a> available to the public, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-model-family-expands/" target="_blank">announced</a> today. They are now generally available to users in the Gemini app, as well as in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><p>Alongside these announcements, Google also introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite today, June 17. The preview version of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now available for testing, and it’s a newer alternative to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, which was made public earlier this year. Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is “our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet,” according to Google.</p><p>Compared to the other Gemini 2.5 models, the Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite preview is all about efficiency and cost-cutting. While it doesn’t perform as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro or Flash, it still holds its own in benchmark tests. It’s also significantly cheaper to run compared to the better Gemini 2.5 models, which could be appealing to developers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.41%;"><img id="Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm" name="Gemini-25-Flash-Lite" alt="Benchmark test results for the Gemini 2.5 family." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pu5z2UgPhQRpnaUVn782Rm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="1108" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google )</span></figcaption></figure><p>“2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks,” the company explains in the blog post. “It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts.”</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite still has a one-million-token context window and multimodal input, and can integrate with services like Google Search or execute code. It’ll also support thinking budgets, so you can turn on thinking without wasting tokens.</p><p>You can try out the preview for Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite now in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

Now you can send playlists straight to your smartwatch or other devices without ever touching them, so you don't have to wrestle with tiny screens or dig through the app.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/13/spotify-remote-downloads/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Spotify’s fresh feature lets you push your music to any signed-in device, and it doesn’t matter where it is. Whether it’s your phone, laptop, tablet, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">favorite smartwatch</a> (think Galaxy Watch, Pixel Watch, or even your Apple Watch), your playlists are just a tap away from landing wherever you want them.</p><p>Prior to this update, getting music onto your smartwatch meant fiddling with your wearable's tiny screen, and it's annoying at best.

Now, you can easily oversee and organize your music library on up to five devices, all from the Spotify app on your main phone. It’s a smarter way to keep your tunes in check without hopping between devices.</p><p>Once you hit the "Manage Downloads" button in the options menu, you’ll instantly see which devices have that playlist saved offline. It’s a slick way to keep tabs on what’s eating up your five-device limit, and you can even clear out downloads right then and there.</p><p>SamMobile reports that this feature is already live on Samsung devices running One UI 7 and Galaxy Watches with Wear OS 5.0. Spotify is rolling it out slowly, so not everyone will see it immediately, but it’s definitely on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This time, prominent tipster Evan Blass posted renders of the alleged smartwatch lineup, giving us a good look at what to expect from this year's series.</p><p>Blass, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/">in his newsletter</a>, posted three images of the upcoming<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, showing off their design and potential colorways. Right off the bat, Blass says that the Korean OEM could launch this year's series as a trio consisting of the standard Galaxy Watch 8, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as the new Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025).</p><p>Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak">similar images cropped up online</a> showing off the trio's design as well as some of its physical buttons. But this is the first time the new Ultra model is being referred to as the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025). Blass' renders imply that all three watches will sport a squircle design.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>To start, the standard Galaxy Watch 8 could allegedly show up in a smoother, less noisy square-ish silver base topped by a circular dial. The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>The renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. It gives us a clear look at two buttons on one side, flanking a smaller orange button, also rumored to be the "Quick" button, possibly giving users access to apps that they use often. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), as the tipster calls it, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p>While these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt, the Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this summer during Samsung's Unpacked, which<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> isn't too far away</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The main demand is "Make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller," and doing both is an obvious "challenge."</p><p>Ingham concluded that there will be a "broad set of categories" for AR glasses, from 30-degree displays for notification windows to 70-degree displays for full-on entertainment, and from cloud-based AI through your phone to a "full computer on your head."

He described a range of potential AR "market segments":</p><ul><li>Monocolor AR glasses with basic, subtle text function</li><li>Full-color single-display glasses like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR prototype</a></li><li>Binocular, full FoV glasses like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> or Snap Spectacles with higher power demands and "bigger form factors"</li><li>Affordable "smart goggles" like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> that don't need to "look like regular glasses"</li><li>Full optical see-through (OST) headsets like the Hololens</li></ul><p>What Kress didn't say is that this nebulousness makes it very difficult to imagine AR glasses' future, because it's far too complicated for non-techies to understand.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> also have a range of form factors.

As long as your "reality is augmented," it could be audio, visual, or any other sensory changes. By that definition, Meta AI glasses are "AR glasses," which is questionable.</p><p>Kress took a different perspective. For him, AR glasses must have a display, but must also offer "something that cannot be replaced by audio." Multimodal AI — the killer app for smart glasses that analyzes what you see — might benefit from a display, but it already works without one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-6" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Android XR prototype glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kress, who worked on the original Google Glass, explained that once the novelty wore off, consumers had "no real use for it." That's why Glass transitioned to enterprise, where developers could get clear "return on investment (ROI)" in areas like automotive, avionics, surgery, and architecture.</p><p>So what will change with AR glasses now? Kress believes the visual component only becomes necessary when you can achieve "World Locking," where 6DoF tracking and a visual positioning system let glasses accurately point to a specific, physical element of your world. Right now, the Android XR UI can only hover in empty space.</p><p>You also need affordable, power-efficient microLEDs to display the data clearly and efficiently, Kress noted. But software is the key. It's an unsurprising perspective from a Google engineer, given the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">focus on Android XR</a> while leaving hardware to Samsung and others.</p><h2 id="meta-if-they-build-ar-hardware-consumers-will-come-2">Meta: If they build AR hardware, consumers will come</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-2" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Wg6WCfF6F7nr2A7ddcicT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta's Ingham had a more hardware- and economic-driven perspective on AR glasses' future: Smart glasses need to become mainstream first, or AR glasses have no chance.</p><p>Meta has sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">two million smart glasses</a>, and total glasses sales "better be in double digits" — meaning tens of millions — by 2027, Ingham says, or that's a warning sign for the category.</p><p>She explained how OEMs like Apple and Google need to join Meta with consumer smart glasses to make retailers like Best Buy and Target treat smart glasses as a "whole category."

And they're improving smart glasses' pain points like weight, audio quality, more variety of styles (especially for women), and a lower cost.</p><p>The one obvious pain point she ignored was battery life, and I found that telling.

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Faster-smoother-camera-timeline/ba-p/722288">community update</a>, Google states v3.33 of the app is rolling out now on Android and will address the laggy and, at times, low FPS experience that its camera timeline previously suffered. Specifically, Google says v3.33 "substantially improved" the framerate and loading performance for users.</p><p>Now, users scrolling through the camera timeline to view old events <em>should </em>find an easier, smoother time. The improvements made to scrubbing through the video's timeline should make it easier for users to spot anything of importance, as the old laggy experience might've made this difficult.</p><p>Google adds that this update cuts down on timeline loading times and "frozen" moments.</p><p>The Home app update also brings a "limited access member tier." In short, homeowners can "invite" people into their smart home ecosystem at a "level" that works for them.

What's immediately highlighted is the company's use of a 1-3-4 core architecture for the supposed Dimensity 9500 SoC. The listing claims the chip possesses a single core at 3.23GHz, which is surprising, but there may be a reason for this.</p><p>The Geekbench listing adds that the Dimensity 9500 contains three cores clocked at 3.03GHz and four cores at 2.23GHz.</p><p>After taking the platform's CL benchmark test, the chip allegedly received a score of 15,717.</p><p>Moreover, a comment on the tipster's thread on X highlights a new development: the existence of a Mali-G1-Ultra GPU. It appears that this GPU is from Arm; however, it's not the typical Immortatlis GPU we've seen consistently in recent history for SoCs.</p><h2 id="mediatek-s-next-flagship-2">MediaTek's next flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dimensity 9500 pic.twitter.com/zOgxUdnLrH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1934419737959882899">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>These rumored early specs for MediaTek's next flagship Dimensity are strange, especially considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the Dimensity 9400's power</a>. The current generation's flagship features the same 1-3-4 core setup at 3.62GHz, 3.3GHz, and 2.4GHz, respectively. Moreover, it features a 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU. We're still waiting to see more about this new graphics processor; the 9500 chip is supposedly rocking.</p><p>Though it's strange — the difference in power — the publication claims this is likely due to the early testing stage. More specifically, it says these lower clock speeds "clearly indicate it is not performing as per spec." In reality, it wouldn't make sense for MediaTek to release a "next-gen" flagship SoC that's weaker than last year's flagship. It would feel more like a mid-range chip in that case.</p><p>So, we'll most likely have to wait a little while longer before we see the true power of the Dimensity 9500, which the post claims will "trade blows" with Qualcomm's next Elite SoC.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that MediaTek launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> SoC earlier this year. This model takes things up a notch over the original 9400 chip. For its single core, the chip clocks in at 3.73GHz, so it seems MediaTek is really trying to push toward the 4GHz mark.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Spotted first by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/16/google-play-slide-buy/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this “Slide to buy” feature is now live across the whole digital lineup, such as apps, books, movies, you name it.</p><p>This change appears to be rolling out wide with Play Store version 46.5.19-31.

Seeing this problem, Google has stepped in to fix it. What used to be a quick checkout had a downside—people clicking “buy” by mistake. This new slide move is Google's way of cutting down those oops moments for good.</p><p>With this change, now you have to swipe sideways to confirm before the usual password or fingerprint step kicks in. This new slide-to-buy gesture works the same whether you’re grabbing a one-off app or signing up for a subscription through the Play Store.</p><p>This swipe move is a solid upgrade, especially for people who’ve dialed back or turned off purchase checks. It’s a smart way to make buying stuff a whole lot less stressful, and honestly, we’re all here for it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You&apos;ll also get all of the fitness tracking features that have made Garmin famous, such as over 30 pre-installed activity modes, stress tracking, sleep coach, and comprehensive 24/7 health monitoring. Furthermore, the Epix Gen 2 comes packed with some modern features you might not expect, including multi-band GPS and topographical mapping. </p><p>So what&apos;s the catch? Well, for starters, the Epix Gen 2 came out in 2022 and has since been supplanted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin&apos;s Fenix 8</a> as the leading premium smartwatch from the brand.

After all, if you have a budget of around 500 bucks and you&apos;re not particular about brand names, why not just buy the newer Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YLBBMB"><strong>while it&apos;s on sale for $469 at Amazon?</strong></a></p><p>But, on the other hand, if you want the experience of using a powerful Garmin watch without spending around $1,000 on the latest and greatest model, the Epix Gen 2 is a great pick, and this deal might be exactly what you&apos;re looking for. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, the tech giant is tapping the telephoto lens to boost close-up shots even more, according to a fresh leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-tele-macro-camera" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>.</p><p>This move makes sense when you consider how each lens focuses—telephoto needs more space, while ultrawide gets real close. So, with the Pixel 10, Google is making it smart enough to pick the right lens on the fly depending on how near your subject is.</p><p>At present, Pixel phones mostly rely on the ultrawide lens for macro shots, thanks to some smart engineering tweaks like autofocus that help nail those close-up details. And from the looks of it, that setup isn’t going anywhere with the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="telephoto-s-macro-perks-2">Telephoto’s macro perks</h2><p>Compared to ultrawide lenses, telephoto lenses have some nifty perks for macro shots. They give you a nice, creamy background blur thanks to a shallower depth of field, which is ideal for making your subject pop. Plus, they avoid the funky distortions ultrawide shooters sometimes bring when you get up close.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether this new telephoto-powered macro feature will be available across the whole Pixel 10 lineup. But with the official reveal just a couple months out, we won’t be waiting long to find out.</p><p>On top of beefed-up macro shots, the Pixel 10 is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">step up its video stabilization</a>. According to an earlier report, the phone's upgraded stabilization could rival a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 gimbal, meaning you might get buttery-smooth, pro-level footage straight from your phone, with no extra gear needed.</p><h2 id="triple-camera-shakeup-2">Triple-camera shakeup?</h2><p>Adding more fuel to the hype, early leaks hinted that the base Pixel 10 might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/camera-specs-of-the-pixel-10-series-leak-hinting-at-a-significant-downgrade">ditch the Pixel 9’s two-camera setup for a fresh triple-camera lineup</a>. Typically, regular versions stick to a wide and ultrawide lens, but the Pixel 10 looks set to shake things up by adding a telephoto lens as a third player.</p><p>To make room for it, Google is reportedly tweaking the sensor setup, which might mean some fresh changes to the wide and ultrawide cameras too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To help businesses grow, the Meta-owned service is launching "Ads in Status." With this new feature, the post states its purpose is to "encourage" better/quicker communication between potential new customers and the business in question.</p><p>WhatsApp published a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://business.whatsapp.com/whatsapp-ads">business-focused page</a>, stating people who have created a Channel for their business can also utilize it.</p><p>The platform states the ads it provides were built with "privacy in mind." To display ads you might be interested in, WhatsApp states it does collect limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see." However, WhatsApp reiterates its commitment to keeping your texts, calls, and statuses private through end-to-end encryption (E2EE).</p><p>Joining "Ads in Status" is WhatsApp's new "Promoted Channels" feature. As previously stated, the app will use some limited data on you to determine what content you <em>might </em>be interested in seeing/interacting with. These promoted channels will appear when browsing your Update tab's "Channel" category.</p><h2 id="making-business-moves-2">Making Business Moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.48%;"><img id="88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi" name="whats-app-update-tab-channel-subscriptions" alt="WhatsApp introduces Channel Subscriptions via the Updates tab, which let users conveniently see exclusive updates from places they've subscribed to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88FR5bVfFPc6qgtcKjHzWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="778" height="595" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure><p>WhatsApp is bringing one more feature to its Updates tab in June, called "Channel Subscriptions." Now, if there's a channel making content you enjoy, WhatsApp is letting you (and them) offer support for "exclusive updates" for a monthly fee. These fees will likely be left up to the admin of the channel that's offering exclusive content for its subscribers.</p><p>These three updates were announced today (June 16), so they should've started rolling out already. However, it might take a little while, so just ensure WhatsApp is updated on your phone or tablet as the week continues.</p><p>Rolling out business-focused content updates isn't anything new for WhatsApp, as the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-updates-app-e-commerce-features">brought in-app shopping capabilities</a> a while ago. This was an update in 2023 that let users purchase items from merchants in WhatsApp through its business platform. The service made its payment functions easier and also implemented a verification process to bring users some comfort. Elsewhere, in the past few months, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-generative-ai-business-tools-launch">Meta discussed new business tools</a> that use generative AI.</p><p>Essentially, business owners and advertisers could utilize generative AI to create images and text. A test for this started on Facebook and Instagram late last year, with WhatsApp in its sights.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The names could correlate, at least in part, to the models' respective sizes.</p><p>Galagos, for instance, are known for their small size. That's the alleged reference for the smallest Pixel 12 member, the base model.

Since then, we've seen references to cats, dogs, and reptiles. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">Google Pixel 10 series is said to be codenamed after horses</a>, and the next Pixel 11 generation is rumored to be codenamed after bears. Now, Mystic Leaks believes the further-out Pixel 12 lineup will be named after primates.</p><p>Of course, these codenames are strictly for internal development use. But like old-fashioned Android codenames, they serve as fun ways to track the progress of future Google Pixel hardware. For now, these references don't reveal much about the company's plan for its 2027 lineup of flagship Android smartphones.</p><p>It does seem to indicate that Google plans to keep the Pixel lineup roughly as-is in terms of offerings and sizes. If the company wanted to add a different-sized base model flagship, we might've seen five leaked codenames instead of four. The same could be true if Google planned to introduce a flip-style foldable to pair with the Google Pixel Fold series.</p><p>However, it's always possible that Google has tricks up its sleeve, so we can't rule anything out based on rumored codenames alone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Then, a comprehensive training plan is believed to be generated further, helping users to support their preferred marathon runs.</p><h2 id="antioxidant-index-2">Antioxidant Index</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Antioxidant-Index" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQgUuXfKVZy8QFhLoU24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the Antioxidant Index feature on Galaxy Watch will be able to measure carotenoids — "antioxidants found in green and orange fruits and vegetables — that are stored in the skin." It is said to be utilizing an industry-first feature to assess carotenoid levels in about five seconds, backed by an advanced, light-activated BioActive sensor.</p><p>All these insights supposedly reflect behavioral changes. The aim of the feature is to tackle radicals in the body caused by behavioral factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, for example. Antioxidants, on the other hand, will neutralize those free radicals in order to prevent chronic illness. Thus, the feature with the ability to measure carotenoid antioxidants helps Galaxy Watch users adopt healthier habits.</p><h2 id="galaxy-watch-5-series-and-above-2">Galaxy Watch 5 series and above</h2><p>These advanced features are available for Galaxy Watch users who are willing to try out the One UI 8 Watch beta. However, some features like Vascular Load are available only on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 models.

Meta teased the new partnership on social media, creating a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/oakleymeta/">Instagram Oakley Meta account</a>, teasing that "the next evolution is coming on June 20."</p><p>We first heard about a potential Oakley Meta partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">back in January</a>. Leaks suggested a new pair of smart glasses was in development, dubbed "Supernova 2," a direct follow-up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, which feature the code name "Supernova."</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses feature a camera on the left side of the frame, while Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are rumored to feature a camera in the center.</p><p>Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are also rumored to use Oakley Sphaera frames. I created a mock-up above using Sphaera frames and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-eye">Xreal Eye camera</a> centered just under the nose bridge, similar to how Xreal positions it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> series smart glasses.</p><p>While we don't have official imagery of these new Oakley glasses just yet, this should give you an idea of how they might look.</p><h2 id="sportier-than-ray-bans-2">Sportier than Ray-Bans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2 HUD</a> smart glasses, which look similar to many Oakley styles. ENGO 2 HUD features a small screen to help athletes keep track of stats without having to look down at a watch, but we don't expect Meta to pack a display into Oakley Meta Smart Glasses. Instead, it's far more likely that these Oakley frames will be designed for streaming and recording footage as their main function.</p><p>If Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are anything like the Ray-Ban Metas, they'll feature the battery and other electronics in the arms rather than on the nose bridge as ENGO did. While it's possible that Meta could outfit its new Oakley-branded smart glasses with fitness-focused extras like a heart rate monitor, we haven't seen credible rumors yet suggesting that as a possibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We do expect Oakley Meta Smart Glasses to be a better fit for athletes than Ray-Ban Metas, though. Android Central's Michael Hicks recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">ran a marathon with Ray-Ban Metas</a> and found that, while the functionality was excellent, the fit wasn't quite right for running. Oakley Meta Smart Glasses should fix this with a design that's better suited for athletic activities, including running, cycling, and other sports.</p><p>We fully expect Meta to introduce a third generation of Ray-Ban Meta glasses later this year, as well, which are said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">to include a display</a> in one of the lenses. But we probably won't see these until Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><p>For now, Oakley Meta Smart Glasses will be the first big commercial smart glasses announcement from Meta in 2025. Given that Ray-Ban Metas sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">2 million units and counting</a>, we're curious how Oakley Meta glasses will match up for popularity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The rumors of the device have been swirling around for the past two years. While we have seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE earlier, it is interesting to see the device finally seeing the light of day, according to these recent certifications.</p><p>The expected specifications of the Galaxy Z Flip FE include a 6.7-inch foldable 120Hz screen coupled with a 3.4-inch cover screen. Underneath, the foldable device is expected to ship with an Exynos 2400e chipset paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. For optics, it could have a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 10MP shooter for selfies. It is likely to have One UI 8 (Android 16) on board and feature a 4000mAh battery.</p><p>Alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, Samsung will also introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> Galaxy Watch 8</a> series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, most likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">happening in early July</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Most GaN chargers tend to be squarish, but the flatter profile clearly makes a difference in this regard. And like the best chargers, the UltraSlim utilizes GaN tech to good effect, delivering reliable USB PD charging in a diminutive size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the charger.

It does a good job with Samsung devices as well thanks to PPS, and because you get two ports, there's a total 70W power budget (35W max with each port) when both are in use. If you're using it with a phone and any accessory, it switches to 45W + 20W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't need more than two USB-C charging ports, the UltraSlim is a great travel charger; it's much smaller than its mainstream rivals, and 45W charging out of each port is ideal if you're using Pixel or Galaxy devices.

Right off the bat, you’ll see a big preview of your watch and its current face. Just below that, key information like battery level, last sync time, and connection status is front and center. There’s even a handy “Sync now” button tucked in the top-right corner for quick refreshes.</p><h2 id="familiar-but-cleaner-layout-2">Familiar, but cleaner layout</h2><p>Right under your Fitbit’s preview, you’ll see neatly organized cards for Watch Faces, Apps, and Tiles. These are straight out of the Pixel Watch app playbook. The layout has gained a fresh coat of paint, but don’t expect anything wild—those cards still lead to the same settings you’ve been using.</p><p>Even the main settings menu got a fresh coat of paint. On a Fitbit Sense 2, for instance, you’ll now spot organized sections like Notifications, Device Preferences, Google Services (Wallet and Maps), Fitbit Reminders & Alerts, Tips & Support, System, and Smart Features like Alexa and on-wrist calls.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="material-3-expressive-makeover-incoming-2">Material 3 Expressive makeover incoming</h2><p>Outside of the device settings revamp, Google is also prepping the Fitbit app for a full Material 3 Expressive makeover. The classic Steps view isn’t going anywhere, but you’ll notice a few slick upgrades, like a floating action button for Gemini popping up next to the toolbar. That toolbar is getting a tweak too, ditching the top tabs for a cleaner layout to switch between Day, Week, Month, and Year views.</p><p>Google has been tightening up the Fitbit app in the past few months. One of the bigger changes came early last year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-sleep-view-redesign">Sleep tracking got a major revamp</a>. Instead of bouncing between screens, you now get everything — last night’s sleep breakdown, your overall score, and a full timeline — all in one scroll-free view.</p><p>Back in March, Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/fitbits-health-metrics-are-getting-a-redesign-on-android-and-ios">gave its Health Metrics page a makeover</a> to match the app’s overall feel. As part of the revamp, it ditched the separate “Today” and “Trends” tabs and rolled everything into one unified view.</p> ]]></dc:content>
