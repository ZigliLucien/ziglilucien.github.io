Also if your laptop or desktop don't have enough ports or are missing specific ports.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You couldn't care less for tech collaborations, in which case you might as well get the standard version, unless you don't think you need a docking station.</p><h2 id="power-and-style-all-in-one-2">Power and style, all in one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="p5DPGMgPeGRErAuoWxwsNJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-6" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5DPGMgPeGRErAuoWxwsNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been using the Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station for some time now, and I can't believe I've gone this long without one of these. Aside from the stylish design (which I'll get to later), this is an incredibly versatile docking station that has just about anything anyone might need at their desk, especially if they work from home like me.</p><p>Surprisingly, between my work laptop and my personal laptop, I don't really have all the ports and connections that I would want. This power station solves that problem thanks to its 14 ports, including multiple USB-C and USB-A ports, SD and microSD card readers, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and multiple HDMI ports. Not only can it provide up to 140W of power to your laptop, but the front USB-C ports support up to 10Gbps and charge up to 100W, which is enough for any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p><p>For anyone working from home, you can connect up to three displays to your Mac or PC, with one display supporting up to 8K resolution and the other two supporting 4K. Plus, you have an Ethernet port for fast data speeds up to 2.5Gbps, and a small display in front to monitor your connections (and it also doubles as a nice clock).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="m9MpgZ5roYNPHuMDcvjmqJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-7" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9MpgZ5roYNPHuMDcvjmqJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kkB9f79345HX2SPyeHTJcJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-5" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkB9f79345HX2SPyeHTJcJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="dgRLbFAyvsz4aKijSKfZPJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-2" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgRLbFAyvsz4aKijSKfZPJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pYkdUyBZFfbdVeJyVBtfhJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-1" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pYkdUyBZFfbdVeJyVBtfhJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="X4JcVEJXgYPTNzX8xBWAbJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-4" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X4JcVEJXgYPTNzX8xBWAbJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The design is truly something. There are gold accents throughout for the Anker x Black Myth: Wukong moniker, an image of the Destined One, and even the control knob on the side, all of which stand out against the mostly black-and-gray chassis. Even the front panel has an interesting yet subtle golden pattern that fades into black as it approaches the display, and all the labels in front are also golden.</p><p>Anker takes this collaboration to another level by including a selection of screen savers for the display, all inspired by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.

Samsung just did what it does best and threw us a three-panel curveball, officially unveiling its Galaxy Z TriFold today(Dec 1).</p><p>The company stated in its press release that this form factor was long overdue and showcases "engineering mastery with its most advanced  foldable technologies optimized for the unique demands of a multi-folding design." From the looks of it, the Galaxy Z TriFold is incredibly thin, competing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, featuring a large 10-inch display and two panels that fold inwards.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.58%;"><img id="bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="714" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Getting right into the specs of the device, the Galaxy Z TriFold showcases a 10-inch QXGA Dynamic AMOLED main screen when unfolded, which gets a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,600 nits of peak brightness. It also features a 6.5-inch cover screen that can get extremely bright with 2600 nits, making it highly visible even in direct sunlight. Considering its incredibly large screen, the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first phone to have "a standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-dex-review-isnt-replacement-your-laptop">Samsung DeX</a> available, meaning users can set up a full working environment on the go."</p><p>As for its dimensions, the Galaxy Z Trifold measures 3.9mm at its thinnest point (screen with the SIM tray), 4.2 mm (center screen), and 4.0 mm (screen with the side button), when unfolded. The device weighs only 309 grams and features Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the cover, a Titanium hinge, and an advanced armor aluminum frame.</p><p>Samsung has made two differently sized hinges that ensure a smoother folding experience, allowing the panels to close without leaving any gaps. It gets an IP48 rating, giving it resistance against freshwater immersion and solid objects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="yzrMkPU2ByHe5dgJ49hk9P" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:171,l:0,cw:4500,ch:2531,q:80/yzrMkPU2ByHe5dgJ49hk9P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When folded, the rear panel of the TriFold looks a lot like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showcasing a triple camera array, sitting atop a vertical pill-shaped island. It gets a massive 200 MP wide-angle sensor with 2x optical quality zoom, an ultra-wide 12 MP camera, and a 10 MP telephoto lens. The cover screen gets a 10MP selfie camera along with a 10MP under-display camera on the main screen, making it easier to click selfies even when the device is unfolded.</p><p>At its core, the Galaxy Z TriFold gets the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> (3 nm), a massive 5,600 mAh battery that supports super-fast Charging 2.0 (45 W), capable of reaching up to 50% charge in about 30 minutes.

Fast forward to today, and it remains one of the best options out there. But now, it's one of the best Cyber Monday Chromebook deals, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G"><strong>as it's $150 off</strong></a>.</p><p>Frankly, we're kind of surprised to see that this deal is still hanging around, as it was one of the first big Black Friday deals we saw. However, there are still a bunch of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Cyber Monday deals</a> going on, so it's awesome to see the Galaxy Chromebook Plus included.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="VCR79RjWNeApWsJnDjX3tY" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VCR79RjWNeApWsJnDjX3tY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$749.99</del> <strong>$549.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Do you want one of the best and thinnest Chromebooks that money can buy? What if we told you that there's a last minute Cyber Monday deal that saves you $150? If we've piqued your interest, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is still on sale for $150 off, but time's running out.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/garmin-instinct-crossover-amoled-gps-smartwatch-47-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-charcoal-with-charcoal-silicone-band-2025/JXF9YFF4XR/sku/6646681?">Samsung - $549.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="409e3f4d-e758-4c7b-9b33-519402dc988f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $749.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a Chromebook that's incredibly thin and lightweight, while still being able to enjoy a beautiful and massive 15.6-inch AMOLED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook that offers a bit more "oomph" in the horsepower department, or one that sports a convertible design.</p><p>Very few expected Samsung to jump back into the Chromebook mix, but it did so with a bang. This was the first Chromebook to be released with the Quick Insert key, giving you easy access to Gemini from practically anywhere. Not only that, but it understands the context of whatever window you're using, meaning that when pressed, the Quick Insert menu will show relevant and/related tasks.</p><p>The star of the show, for some at least, is the gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED touchscreen display. Outside of those who suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM</a>, Samsung's displays are some of the best out there, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> is no different.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-22.jpg" alt="Comparing the thickness between the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGwJinCDt8GHZCH2xckc8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For others, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is an intriguing option due to how thin and lightweight it is. It weighs just 2.58 pounds, and at the thinnest point measures in at a mere 11.8mm (0.46-inches.) Surprisingly, this is actually thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but of course, not the redesigned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/this-insane-cyber-monday-deal-is-probably-the-last-time-well-see-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-so-cheap-until-the-fold-8-arrives">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>As you'd expect, it's no slouch in the performance department either. It's powered by the Intel Core 3 100U chip, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage. However, this is the only configuration that Samsung offers, which is rather disappointing.</p><p>Nevertheless, with Cyber Monday winding to a close, it won't be long before this deal is gone again. So make sure you jump on the train before it runs out of steam.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-7">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google seems to be ringing in the holidays on a great note! It just silently dropped a teaser of the "Android Show: XR Edition" showcasing two Android bots wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR headset</a> and the rumoured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">XR smart glasses</a>.</p><p>The show is set to be livestreamed on December 8, where Google will talk all about the "Future of Android XR." During the show, the tech giant is expected to discuss  "all things XR across glasses, headsets, and everything in between." Which seems exciting since the Galaxy XR headset just launched in October, and now we may get a glimpse at the progress Google and Android have made on smartglasses—and we aren't complaining! The tease does showcase the bot wearing glasses with a tiny lens on one side.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3-OJxxW810" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Additionally, Google says that we will get to "Hear how with Gemini by your side, you can have a more conversational, contextual, and helpful experience," all within the 30-minute show. A dedicated teaser page was also spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/01/android-xr-show-dec-2025/">9to5Google</a>, which allows you to set a reminder for the show, asking enthusiasts to "Mark their calendars to learn about the latest XR innovations and experiences at The Android Show," much like the YouTube teaser, which also features a "notify me" button.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR </a>is already loaded with so much of Gemini, including Gemini Live, including the real-world search experience that comes with Circle to Search, and the immersive view in Google Maps that basically makes you feel that you're exploring a new touristy spot right from the comfort of your couch. Gemini also offers route suggestions and personalized information, or historical facts based on what you're looking at.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2U3BvOHuNXo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>While the future of XR is still a mystery, we'd definitely like to see the Memory feature that Google showed us at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">I/O earlier this year</a>, where Gemini will use the cameras on the XR devices to log the location of real-world items. You could later ask, "Hey Gemini, where did I leave my keys?" and it would show you where it last saw them.</p><p>So if you're as excited as we are about this end-of-the-year reveal, then go ahead and hit the "notify me" button to watch the action unfold in real time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want the best Qualcomm chips for AI and general performance, the OnePlus Pad 3 is your only option.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN" name="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Notes app - OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6H6maSEcHzfNXUeFKpWCQN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN" name="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" alt="ES-DE for Android on the OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpbtmNPDxyTrnCce7t58PN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q5ZgZk2NLhe89Hbfn9myLN" name="OnePlus Pad 3 with keyboard removed" alt="OnePlus Pad 3 with keyboard removed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5ZgZk2NLhe89Hbfn9myLN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qbYEMLXFUTb3edAzyByAMN" name="OnePlus Pad 3 and Pad 2" alt="OnePlus Pad 3 and Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbYEMLXFUTb3edAzyByAMN.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Better yet, it's more affordable than a Samsung tablet. It runs Android 16, and OxygenOS has come a long way, so it's very easy to use. There are also incredible multitasking features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">Open Canvas</a>, which lets you use up to five apps at once.</p><p>If I was in the market for an Android tablet this Cyber Monday, I'd go for the OnePlus Pad 3. It's much better than cheaper options while hitting a reasonable price point, which is something that Samsung's flagship tablets can't do.

I'm willing to bet you're all spent out at this point, BUT, if you've still got $17 left, hear me out.

For me, at least, the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S controllers are <em>very</em> easy to drop. I find them to be slightly slippery and just a tad uncomfortable for some games. Adding a hand strap quite literally fixes everything I dislike about the design, and not only significantly enhances comfort by balancing the weight across your whole hand, but it also makes throwing things in VR much easier.</p><p>That last part might sound silly until you realize just how often you have to toss things in VR games....</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c346403c-f3b1-4be2-9ca6-51ce26d5d3f4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="These extra minimalist grips for the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are a massive upgrade without adding bulk to your controllers.

These help all of that, and they make things easier to toss in VR, too!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're looking for a full controller cover to guard against bumps and scratches, or you use a charging dock to charge your controllers up. Docks aren't compatible with controller grips.</p><p>Of all the grips available for Quest controllers, these are my favorite because they're so dang minimalist. It simply replaces the battery door. There's no awkward installation like a full coverage controller grip usually needs, and the only time you have to pop these off is when you want to change the battery. In that case, there's no difference in procedure from the standard kit, making this a huge win.</p><p>If you want a full coverage controller grip, I'd recommend these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/design-Extended-Controller-Compatible-Oculus-Suitable/dp/B0DK4LG7T4/">Kiwi Design G4 Max grips</a>, although the extra material will cost you a bit more.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-22">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Don't give up! Scroll down to "Samsung trade-in," click "Yes, trade in," then click "No" next to it without entering a watch model. If you're like me, you'll see that the "Samsung Instant Credit" has updated to $150, and you'll scroll up to a $199 deal price!</p><p>That credit applies to other models, too, so you can get the Watch 8 44mm for $229 instead of $379, or the Watch 8 40mm LTE for $249 instead of $399! If the $150 credit doesn't show up for you, try refreshing the page or selecting other options, and see if the website decides to show this "exclusive" discount for you; if it doesn't, at least you can save $100, or more with a trade-in.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNxS2G8Htu9DPyvetR6euN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review" data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>We rank the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> of 2025. It's certainly the most comfortable, with the best integration for Galaxy phone owners and the longest software support through 2029. While I also recommend the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> as a more stylish alternative, its Cyber Monday deal is much smaller.</p><p>Our Galaxy Watch 8 reviewer appreciated that it's lightweight for sleep tracking and workouts, while still well-protected with sapphire glass and an MIL-STD-810H rating. It has fast performance with plenty of RAM, and while its battery life isn't the best, you probably won't want to spend a few hundred extra just to upgrade for the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Other retailers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch8-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-silver-2025/JJGRF3X43F"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8aa7ae67-52cf-4375-b7bc-44e98c7c47cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dFwawDhK2LrM7KbNczM7fQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dFwawDhK2LrM7KbNczM7fQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to prioritize affordability, but without losing hardware quality. You have a Samsung phone — the Galaxy Watch has a couple of exclusive features — and you want a design that's well-suited for sleep tracking, with unique stats like Antioxidant Index, Energy Score, and Vascular Load.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You dislike the unique squircle case design, you have a Pixel or OnePlus phone that'd work better with another smartwatch, or you're willing to pay extra for a Classic or Ultra.</p><p>You can also find some pretty massive discounts on Samsung's pricier models, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8-classic/buy/galaxy-watch8-classic-46mm-black-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l500nzkdxaa/"><strong>$200 off the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</strong></a>, making it cheaper than the original Galaxy Watch 8 price. I enjoyed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">reviewing the Watch 8 Classic</a> because of its rotating bezel for more exact controls, along with a more traditional style. But the Watch 8 is the better last-minute deal, simply because it's $100 cheaper and lightweight enough to fit any wrist size.</p><p>I don't know how long these hidden Samsung watch deals will last — or even if you'll see them — but I assume they'll go away once Cyber Monday ends tonight. So if you're at all interested in a smartwatch upgrade, now's the time!</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-deals-quick-links-7">Cyber Monday deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Beyond that, you'll find premium features on the best sets that a cheap pair of $50 earbuds just can't deliver. Here's what makes the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro worth buying</p><p><strong>The Price</strong>. I have to start here, and that's probably pretty important to you, too. These are normally $250, and today they are marked down to $150. Saving a hundo is sweet.</p><p><strong>Packed with features</strong>. Samsung has leveraged the tiny computer inside these buds to make them do so much more than just be a speaker. A new audio codec (if you have the right phone), head tracking spatial audio, Galaxy AI, seamless device switching, and more. A lot more.</p><p><strong>They fit great for most people</strong>. You will see some reviews from folks who can't seem to keep them inside their ears, but most people love the fit of these. Samsung redesigned that body and angle, and in my experience, it works great.</p><p><strong>Excellent ANC</strong>. Usually, when you keep adding features, you reach a point where the battery can't keep up. ANC is very power-hungry and is often the first thing to be scaled back. Not on these; even with everything else going on, the Buds 3 Pro have world-class ANC.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-buds-alone.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2tmbQWqBtYZjYeRixp3AdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is perfect, and there is one big flaw with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro: they were specifically built with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-through-cyber-monday-is-the-best-time-to-build-a-product-ecosystem">Galaxy ecosystem</a> in mind.</p><p>You might be thinking, "How is that a flaw?" and you're right. Flaw is a harsh word, but it can be a deal breaker. Unless you have a fairly new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phone</a>, you're going to be missing out a little.</p><p>Let me start by saying right up front: if you use an iPhone, don't buy these. They essentially are just another pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and if you want them to do more, you need to buy earbuds from Apple.</p><p>For everyone else, the list of what's missing without a new Galaxy phone is still mighty long. You won't get the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a> experience, and there's no head tracking. Some AI features, notably the real-time Interpreter, only function with a Galaxy phone. If you have something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> (which is how I use them), the quick pairing and seamless switching are awesome. Without a Galaxy phone, it's mediocre. ANC is still excellent, but it loses some of the adaptive qualities that put it over the top when used without a phone using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">Galaxy AI</a>. Finally, the SSC (Samsung Seamless Audio) high-res audio support - one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> available - <strong>only</strong> works when paired to a new Galaxy phone.</p><p>These work with any Android phone, and they still sound good and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">great ANC</a>, but the best way to use them is with a new phone from Samsung.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>What phone are you using? If you have something like a Galaxy S25 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, then <strong>hell yeah. It's a yes from me, dawg</strong>. If you aren't, then maybe you might want to check out some others before you plunk that money down.</p><p>I will mention that if the Galaxy S24 Ultra were my main phone, I would use these every day simply because they sound almost as good as a very expensive set of wired earbuds. For real. Unfortunately, with my Motorola Razr, they don't.</p><p>If you have an iPhone, spring for a pair of AirPods. If you have a Pixel, the Pixel Buds are calling you. The list goes on, and even companies like OnePlus offer earbuds that are good with all phones, but best when used with the same brand of products. It's simply how it is.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-27">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, it impressed us enough that it was one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">Best of MWC 2025</a> winners!</p><p>This small, foldable device can project a bright 100-lumen image by mirroring your phone. This can turn any moment into a movie night if there's no TV in sight. Just connect and go! According to Aurzen, there's no lag, and the projector can adjust the image based on the angle to avoid distortion.</p><p>And it doesn't just work for horizontal videos; it can also display vertical videos without black bars by turning it on its side. And because of its tri-fold design, you can angle it in many different ways, from straight on to straight up. There's also a separate magnetic mount that you can stick on nearly any surface, letting you get creative with your projector placement, or use the magnetic stand to prop it up and double your battery life for movie nights (both accessories sold separately or in a bundle).</p><p>What's great is that it supports smartphone connections, but you can also connect it to your PS5 or Nintendo Switch, granted you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aurzen.com/collections/zip-series-portable-projector/products/castplay-wireless-hdmi-transmitter">HDMI transmitter</a> (sold separately). This makes it a great backup in case you find yourself without a TV.</p><p>It's also extremely portable, weighing about as much as a large flagship smartphone but at half the size. So you can just stick it in your pocket if you don't have the carrying case.</p><p>Of course, there are downsides, such as a native 720p resolution (which supports 1080p upscaling), short battery life, and a lack of ports, but these are concessions that you can expect from such a portable yet powerful projector such as this.</p><p>If you're looking for a stocking stuffer, this would definitely make a great gift!</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-32">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon is currently offering 36% off the price of the latest Echo Dot.</strong></a></p><p>The Echo Dot comes with a smaller overall design than the regular Echo speaker, though it still boasts a pretty loud volume as a smart speaker. Like most smart speakers, the device offers instant access to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, seamlessly letting users cue up music on their favorite streaming services or control smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and more.</p><p>The Echo Dot also comes with a ring LED light on the bottom of the unit, unlike previous generations, which included a similar light near the top. It also has a 3.5mm headphone output, in case users want to plug the device into an external speaker, a TV, or another device. This deal is available for all three of the Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker colors, including Charcoal, Deep Sea Blue, and Glacier White.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LdeR7Dvz9zXRXv8xYGvWET" name="amazon-echo-dot-5th-gen-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeR7Dvz9zXRXv8xYGvWET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="766" height="766" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Echo Dot:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.99</del> <strong>$31.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Amazon Echo Dot just dropped 36% during <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025">Amazon's Cyber Monday sale</a>, meaning it's currently just $31. The smart speaker is not only smaller than the regular Amazon Echo, but it also comes with a price tag that's $50 cheaper—even before this Cyber Monday deal came along.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.99" data-dimension48="$49.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a small countertop option for accessing smart home devices, Alexa's voice assistant, or music streaming across devices; you're looking to spend around $30-$50 on a smart speaker, and you don't want to upgrade to the larger Amazon Echo.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd prefer to upgrade to the higher-powered Amazon Echo, or another device, such as the Echo Studio or Sonos One; you're looking for a smart home device with a screen or other interface, rather than one that's just a speaker; you're looking for a smart speaker with industry-leading audio quality.</p><p>Amazon's Echo Dot boasts a small overall design that's easy to fit on counters and desktops, or just about anywhere in your home. While the smaller build than the regular Echo device does compromise a little on audio quality, sporting just a single forward-firing 1.73-inch speaker. Still, you can connect it to a second Echo Dot if you prefer stereo audio, or if you want to customize the audio you can utilize the EQ settings in the Alexa app.</p><p>While it may not be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">best smart speaker</a> from an audio perspective, given the smaller speaker, it's truthfully not much different from the regular Echo model otherwise. And it's hard to go wrong with a price tag of just over $30, especially if you don't need anything too terribly loud or high-quality.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-deals-2025-quick-links-2">Cyber Monday deals 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While it primarily works within the Samsung and Google ecosystems, it does have support for a few third-party services, like Spotify. The Now Brief also taps into YouTube for video recommendations to satisfy your video and audio needs.

The update will apparently add prompts that ask users if they want to share their YouTube data with Samsung to improve recommendations.

We pretend otherwise because they're so useful, but plenty of people prefer luxury watches, or even a cheap watch from a discount department store. If you want a middle ground — a hybrid watch that tracks your health and shows basic notifications but still looks stylish — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-best-hybrid-smartwatch">ScanWatch Nova</a> is your best bet.</p><p>The ScanWatch 2 tracks your heart rate, sleep stages, breathing quality, nightly blood oxygen, and menstrual cycles like most smartwatches, but that just scratches the surface. It passively catches irregular heart rhythm like an Apple or Fitbit watch, and it continuously measures your skin temperature, even during the day, so you know immediately if you're showing signs of sickness or "overheating" for too long during workouts.</p><p>Most importantly, it does so with a traditional profile that won't look out of place in professional contexts, and with a battery that lasts up to 35 days per charge. It's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Monitor-Health-Smartwatch/dp/B0CHGVXVZM"><strong>$289 ($80 off) at Amazon</strong></a>, but you can <strong>save another $20</strong> by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/landing/black-friday"><strong>signing up for Withings's newsletter</strong></a>, then buying from Withings directly.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="95648a3a-9bb0-4d84-bd19-7428c88061df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Save $100 (27% off) on the ScanWatch 2 on Withings.com" data-dimension48="or: Save $100 (27% off) on the ScanWatch 2 on Withings.com" data-dimension25="$289.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Monitor-Health-Smartwatch/dp/B0CHGVXVZM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Ccr27XqQ8VZsysvcavnbGH" name="withings-scanwatch-2" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ccr27XqQ8VZsysvcavnbGH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>or: Save $100 (27% off) on the </strong><a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/scanwatch-2/42w/shop" data-dimension112="95648a3a-9bb0-4d84-bd19-7428c88061df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="or: Save $100 (27% off) on the ScanWatch 2 on Withings.com" data-dimension48="or: Save $100 (27% off) on the ScanWatch 2 on Withings.com" data-dimension25="$289.95"><strong>ScanWatch 2 on Withings.com</strong></a></p><p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 is available in two sizes and five finishes — Black, Pearl White, Blue, Blue with Rose Gold, or Sand with Rose Gold — allowing you to tailor it to your personal style.

You already have a Withings scale and want to pair health insights with weight data.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want a smartwatch that doesn't skimp on features and includes a display that's much easier to read; or, you'd prefer a health-tracking tool that's even more subtle, like a Whoop band.</p><p>You can see how the OLED cutout blends in normally, but displays info clearly (though narrowly) when you receive a notification or use the crown to rotate through health options. I like the 42mm ScanWatch that Withings sent, but the 38mm finish is a better option for folks with narrow wrists because it weighs 18g less and looks more classically petite.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jgopwkvwb8AoSKe5XgMwre" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jgopwkvwb8AoSKe5XgMwre.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>An alternative for folks that usually drop Rolex-level money on a watch is the ScanWatch Nova, which features the same health and battery specs but adds a diver-style design with a rotating stainless steel bezel and anti-reflective sapphire glass.

The AI model is powerful, but the app itself can feel awkward and unfinished. Google seems to agree, as a company executive recently confirmed that a major “UX 2.0” update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> app is on the way.</p><p>Logan Kilpatrick, product lead for Google AI Studio, recently replied to a post on X saying the company is making a "huge investment" in what he calls "Gemini App UX 2.0." This suggests the AI platform’s look and feel could change a lot soon.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">huge investment happening in Gemini App UX 2.0 right now, hoping we win you over with this iteration :)<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1994505135448625446">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>This would be a big change for a service that’s always been strong underneath but can sometimes feel awkward to use. The redesign may aim to close that gap by giving users clearer entry points and a layout that finally matches the growing capabilities of Gemini’s newer models. That said, it remains unclear what changes Google is planning to introduce.</p><p>The revamped experience is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-tweaks-geminis-android-app-with-a-fresh-homepage-and-my-stuff-view">already surfacing on the Android app</a>, which quietly rolled out a refreshed homepage. Now, you now get a cleaner greeting banner, a darker background in dark mode, and a reorganized set of action chips arranged vertically for easier scanning.</p><p>Tools like “Create image,” “Deep Research,” and “Write anything” no longer feel buried. A new “My Stuff” section in the side menu gives you an easy way to revisit everything Gemini has produced — images, videos, long-form outputs, Canvas projects, and more. It’s the closest thing yet to a unified creative hub inside the app.</p><h2 id="native-macos-app-confirmed-2">Native macOS app confirmed</h2><p>Beyond a fresh coat of paint, Google is finally breaking a major barrier: Gemini is coming to macOS. Kilpatrick confirmed in another response that a native macOS client is in the works, a move that directly challenges other desktop-centric AI tools.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@joshwoodward and the team are working on it!<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1994921531504201914">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>This is a big step for productivity. Right now, if you use Gemini on a Mac, you have to use a browser. That means you can’t easily drag and drop files from your desktop or use deeper system features.</p><p>Besides making drag-and-drop easier, a native app could streamline creative tasks and give Mac users a stable option, avoiding the need to switch between Google services in Safari or Chrome. More importantly, it will match the seamless experience ChatGPT users have enjoyed for a while.</p><p>Gemini has always been powerful, but its usability has been the real issue. With competition heating up from OpenAI and Anthropic — both of which already offer polished, app-first experiences — Google seems to recognize that a scattered interface won’t cut it anymore.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the OP (original post), the user has a doorbell and two cameras; however, they're unable to see their live video feeds through the Google Home app. The user states that the green lights are on, indicating that the devices are hooked up properly. Notifications are reportedly hitting their phone as expected, and they're able to watch recorded clips.</p><p>The only problem is that the Home app is treating its connected devices as if they're offline. This only started happening "since I transferred the doorbell from Nest to Home," per the report. The report adds that this conflict between the app and their doorbell (in this example) is affecting their speaker, as guests ringing their doorbell don't cause the sound to play.</p><p>The user adds that this has been happening for a while, but they can't find a solution anywhere.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Apps-Account/Camera-offline-since-transferred-to-Google-Home/m-p/766600/highlight/true#M35099">user states</a> they've been having this issue ever since Google started migrating users from its old Nest app to the Home app. Their cameras "showed offline immediately after migrating, but I went through and hard reset everything, and they worked for a couple of days, but now they’re all showing offline again."

More than that, a Google representative has not responded yet to the ongoing community thread.</p><p>The timing of these Nest doorbell and camera issues with the Home app gaining more ground is impeccable. It was recently made known that a federal class action lawsuit was filed against Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-google-over-home-and-nest-hardware">due to the degrading and "malfunctioning" state</a> that has become Google's smart home devices. Specifically, those from Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, and Kaplan Gore, LLP are fighting for consumers who may possess a Google Nest Hub, Google Nest Hub Max, Google Nest Mini, or Google Nest Audio.</p><p>Per the argument, these devices have become less capable of handling/processing users' voice commands over the years. Darren Kaplan from Kaplan Gore stated, "However, rather than getting 'smarter' and better over time, these Google ‘smart’ home devices get worse at their core function..."</p><p>These reports (from users) started appearing more and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-resolves-issue-causing-nest-speakers-displays-to-fail-answering-basic-requests">early this year</a>, and Google has yet to provide an appropriate fix.

One of the best offers I've seen today is a mouthful: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-z-flip7"><strong>trade in an eligible device, regardless of condition, and add a line with the Experience Beyond plan and T-Mobile will hook you up</strong></a> with a free Galaxy Z Flip 7, Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G, AND the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Of course, nothing is ever <em>really </em>free with carrier deals, and you'll still need to pay for the service line of each device you claim. The "free" part comes from the retail value: all together, these devices would cost over $2,000. This Cyber Monday T-Mobile deal makes it so you aren't paying<em> </em>any of that.</p><p>Another nice part of the deal is that you don't have to claim all three devices to get them for free. Simply want the phone and the watch? You got it. Just the tablet? Done. The only requirement is that you grab the Z Flip 7 at minimum. After that, the choice is yours.</p><h2 id="the-ultimate-samsung-bundle-deal-at-t-mobile-2">The Ultimate Samsung Bundle deal at T-Mobile</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0a2f01d5-cab1-4454-aa0f-5ab8d4ecfd5d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile" data-dimension48="The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-z-flip7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:414px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.00%;"><img id="ZEKa7HijfJzypKQgWE7aPc" name="t-mobile-samsung-bundle-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZEKa7HijfJzypKQgWE7aPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="414" height="385" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-z-flip7" data-dimension112="0a2f01d5-cab1-4454-aa0f-5ab8d4ecfd5d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile" data-dimension48="The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile" data-dimension25=""><strong>Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Trade in an old or broken phone and add a line with the Experience Beyond and T-Mobile will give you a Galaxy Z Flip 7 deal for free.

A new GSMA database listing suggests that a mystery device, once thought to be the Galaxy Z Flip 8 FE, could actually be something else.</p><p>Rather than a more affordable clamshell, new evidence suggests this model is actually the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-two-galaxy-z-folds-in-2026-wide-fold">long-rumored “Wide” Galaxy Z Fold 8</a>. And this could be Samsung’s biggest change to its foldable lineup yet.</p><p>The confusion began when model number SM-F971 appeared last month. Since Samsung usually uses SM-F7xx numbers for Flip models, many thought this was the Flip 8 FE. But the details didn’t quite add up.</p><p>A new entry in the GSMA’s global database, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsungs-mysterious-galaxy-z-fold-model-surfaces-in-gsma-database/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>, tells a different story. SM-F971 sits alongside the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a> (SM-F976) as part of a dual-Fold strategy for 2026, rather than a budget Flip model. This shift in view comes from Samsung’s model naming patterns and several reports that the company has been testing a wider Fold.</p><h2 id="a-wider-z-fold-8-takes-shape-with-a-square-display-2">A wider Z Fold 8 takes shape with a square display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:558px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.81%;"><img id="LnTuVgtfDjd8yZkH2yHfCR" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-8-Wide" alt="GSMA listing revealing a phone likely to be the Galaxy Z Fold 8 Wide" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnTuVgtfDjd8yZkH2yHfCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="558" height="211" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is where the “Wide” Fold 8 enters the picture. Instead of the tall, narrow shape Samsung has used since the first Fold, the new version is said to use two 18:9 panels that open into a square 18:18 display. When closed, it would be wider and shorter than the current Fold.</p><p>Some early sources say Samsung hopes this design will compete with Apple’s rumored wider foldable. That could be why both Fold 8 models might launch at the same time.</p><p>The naming logic adds weight to the rumor. Samsung’s Flip line has never used the “F97x” tag, and FE devices have historically followed the same structure as their premium counterparts. A Flip FE wouldn’t suddenly adopt Fold-style numbering.</p><p>On the other hand, a new Fold model makes sense, especially if it’s meant to be sold alongside the regular Fold 8. This matches reports that Samsung has two Fold projects for 2026: the usual update and a new design to help the lineup stand out as competition grows.</p><p>For buyers, 2026 could bring two different Fold options: the usual book-style Fold 8 for those who like a phone-first design, and a wider, squarer Fold 8 “Wide” for people who want a mini-tablet that really works like one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A recent leak claimed Samsung might increase wired <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-series-may-finally-boost-charging-speeds-for-a-faster-user-experience">charging speeds to 60W</a>, and now another leak hints that improved wireless charging speeds are also on the way.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-8-5-super-fast-wireless-charging-apk-teardown-3620799/">Android Authority</a>, the source code of the new One UI 8.5 build contains references to "Super fast wireless charging." Earlier, the source code only mentioned "Wireless charging" and "Fast wireless charging," which correspond to 5-10W and 15W wireless charging respectively. The new "Super fast wireless charging" label has never appeared before.</p><p>This suggests Samsung is preparing a major wireless charging upgrade for the Galaxy S26 series. There's no mention of exact speeds yet, but we expect "Super fast wireless charging" to fall somewhere in the 20-25W range.</p><h2 id="a-long-overdue-bump-to-samsung-s-charging-speeds-2">A long overdue bump to Samsung's charging speeds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sreYeTQmDmzkNpN9VZ236V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-bottom-01" alt="A close-up of the bottom ports on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sreYeTQmDmzkNpN9VZ236V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has been preparing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 support on the S26 series</a> for a while. There's still no confirmation on whether the Galaxy S26 lineup will support Qi2 natively, but Samsung has been making moves in that direction.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">launched new Qi2 wireless chargers</a> in the U.S. earlier this year, while earlier leaks suggest the Galaxy S26 Ultra could support 25W wireless charging while the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus could reach 20W.</p><p>This upgrade would reportedly reduce charging times by up to 40%, but there's still no official confirmation from the brand. Details will likely arrive closer to launch or when Samsung officially unveils the series.</p><p>That said, even though these leaked speeds aren't "Super fast" compared to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12">OnePlus 15</a> and other flagships, that support up to 50W wireless charging, it would still be a huge upgrade for Samsung's flagship lineup.</p><h2 id="galaxy-s26-ultra-wallpapers-leak-ahead-of-launch-2">Galaxy S26 Ultra wallpapers leak ahead of launch</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

The deal is still around for Cyber Monday and it's a good one.</p><p>The Libra Colour usually is priced at $249.99, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FKobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0CZXWGK79%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6371637323596506687-20"><strong>it’s now on sale for $199.99</strong></a>. The e-reader comes with color ink, so you can see all of those beautiful book covers, and you can write and highlight in color. You can get the device in a gorgeous pearlescent white and a basic black. Personally I opted for the white (it's actually incredibly stunning in real life!)</p><p>Of course, with such a good deal, you'll want to pair your new e-reader with a few accessories that I think will make your reading experience even better. Check out some of the hand-picked add-ons I've curated for you! Happy shopping...and happy reading!!!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="47d59ddd-1709-4422-954a-b0d07bddb4e5">            <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FKobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0CZXWGK79%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8963166328425525356-20" data-model-name="Kobo Libra Colour" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RHqbs4FqAdgP4pskwTfL9k.jpg' alt="Kobo Libra Colour | Ereader | 7” Glare-Free Colour E Ink Kaleido™ 3 Display | Dark Mode Option | Audiobooks | Waterproof | White"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Kobo</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Kobo Libra Colour</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="21be73b4-ae85-494e-a441-9b22bb070e40">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GOVTVA-Double-Magnetic-Closure-Reader/dp/B0D7MNFXRY" data-model-name="Govtva Double Stand Case " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:99.93%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4M6C6p6eStqmZdP3jmj9K.jpg' alt="Govtva Double Stand Case for 7'' Kobo Libra Colour/libra 2 Cover With Auto Sleep&wake/double Hand Strap/magnetic Closure Fits Kobo Libra E-Reader (jungle Flower)"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>GOVTVA</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Govtva Double Stand Case </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="055e1c67-d759-4a6b-9c5d-06f4e55d3763">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GOVTVA-Clear-Libra-Colour-eReader/dp/B0D8ZSJY35" data-model-name="Govtva Slim Clear Case " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t3V2BfMhcUZUYz8MqLxKtW.jpg' alt="Govtva Slim Clear Case for 7" Kobo Libra Colour (2024) Ereader -

I've been using the watch for the past week or so while working on the review, and I do admit that it looks a lot better than before. Even the "Bronze/Sunburst" colorway is starting to grow on me a bit.</p><p>However, not everything is an improvement over the previous generation. Most notably, battery life takes a massive hit, as the new Crossover AMOLED is now rated for 14 days on a single charge. This is less than half the rated battery life of the original Instinct Crossover, and while it's still far more than many other smartwatches, it's something to keep in mind.</p><p>Beyond that, the Crossover AMOLED still lacks any touch controls, leaving you to navigate through menus and dismiss notifications using the built-in buttons. But hey, everything else about this is just as good as the other options in Garmin's vast array of premium smartwatches and fitness trackers.</p><p>Considering that it's not often we see discounts on Garmin wearables, this is one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/if-i-werent-a-smartwatch-hoarder-id-buy-these-black-friday-2025-deals">Cyber Monday smartwatch deal</a> you won't want to pass up.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-43">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>I've tried going without using a smartwatch, but I always come crawling back.

Not just that, but the analog watch hands have been designed in such a way that they stand out better when you need to check the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RipxLq5qEWMoo9p5MmrQb9" name="Garmin-Instinct-Crossover-AMOLED-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Instinct Crossover AMOLED watch with the flashlight active on a person's wrist at night" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RipxLq5qEWMoo9p5MmrQb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Crossover AMOLED also implements multi-band GPS, white & red LED lights, and "identical training tools" to Garmin's Instinct 3. I've been using the watch for the past week or so while working on the review, and I do admit that it looks a lot better than before. Even the "Bronze/Sunburst" colorway is starting to grow on me a bit.</p><p>However, not everything is an improvement over the previous generation. Most notably, battery life takes a massive hit, as the new Crossover AMOLED is now rated for 14 days on a single charge. This is less than half the rated battery life of the original Instinct Crossover, and while it's still far more than many other smartwatches, it's something to keep in mind.</p><p>Beyond that, the Crossover AMOLED still lacks any touch controls, leaving you to navigate through menus and dismiss notifications using the built-in buttons. But hey, everything else about this is just as good as the other options in Garmin's vast array of premium smartwatches and fitness trackers.</p><p>Considering that it's not often we see discounts on Garmin wearables, this is one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/if-i-werent-a-smartwatch-hoarder-id-buy-these-black-friday-2025-deals">Cyber Monday smartwatch deal</a> you won't want to pass up.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-44">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While most of these accessories provide improvements in comfort or immersion, a charging dock is pretty much useless.</p><p>That's because most docks don't support controller charging when using wrist straps or cases, and I don't know about you, but I don't use my Quest controllers without those things. So, instead of wasting your money on a charging dock that doesn't actually make charging more convenient, spend your money on these excellent accessories <strong>I've personally tested</strong>, all on sale for Cyber Monday.</p><p>I've organized these according to upgrade priority, so if you're just grabbing <em>one</em> item from this list, make it one of the headstrap replacements.

This means that a ton of retailers all across the web are dropping considerable discounts on tech, while others are simply extending their existing Black Friday price drops a little longer.</p><p>While we might get lucky with a few offers, many of the best deals are certain to expire at midnight tonight. When looking for a great offer to buy before the sales wrap up, keep an eye out for a "Cyber Monday deal" stamp on the product page. This will be a good indicator of whether or not the discount is set to expire this evening. And as always, if you're shopping at Amazon, use <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> for price history tracking. Sometimes a deal will look really good but will actually be a common occurrence. That's where price tracking comes in handy.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-57">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's replacing the Google Assistant on all Home and Nest devices released since 2016, albeit slowly. The Gemini for Home rollout is ongoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-official-early-access-with-smart-live-help-across-googles-devices">as part of an early access program</a>, and it's becoming available on a per-home basis.</p><p>Aside from bringing an upgraded assistant to Google Home and Nest devices, the Gemini rollout also adds 10 new voice options. Previously, Google Home users had to wait to gain Gemini for Home access to change to one of the new voices. However, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1pa0xv7/updated_force_gemini_for_home/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> uncovered, there's a simple hack that lets users change to a new voice while remaining on Google Assistant (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/30/gemini-home-assistant-voice-trick/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>It involves entering the following URL on the mobile Chrome browser:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>googlehome://assistant/voice/setup</code></pre><p>After entering the URL, a prompt will appear asking users if they want to <strong>Continue</strong> to open the Google Home app. Then, the entire onboarding experience for Gemini for Home appears, as if the user had gained access to Gemini. By following the prompts, users can change to one of the new voices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6hHQzYwCRWZbcBsRHDrbqZ" name="Gemini-For-Home-Voices" alt="Setting up Gemini for Home voices in the Chrome browser." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hHQzYwCRWZbcBsRHDrbqZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here are the new voices you'll be able to try, along with their descriptions:</p><ul><li><strong>Amaryllis:</strong> Bright, higher voice</li><li><strong>Bloom:</strong> Calm, mid-range voice</li><li><strong>Calathea:</strong> Australian accent, higher voice</li><li><strong>Croton:</strong> Smooth, deeper voice</li><li><strong>Fern:</strong> Warm, higher voice</li><li><strong>Magnolia: </strong>Calm, deeper voice</li><li><strong>Oxalis: </strong>Bright, mid-range voice</li><li><strong>Pothos:</strong> Engaging, mid-range voice</li><li><strong>Violet: </strong>British accent, mid-range voice</li><li><strong>Yarrow:</strong> Warm, deeper voice</li></ul><p>The onboarding experience behaves as if the user has completed the Gemini for Home transition, with Gemini replacing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>.

After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-launch-date-confirmed">confirming that the phone will debut on December 17</a>, OnePlus today revealed specs for the upcoming OnePlus 15R, along with additional details about the Pad Go 2 and Watch Lite.</p><p>OnePlus has confirmed the 15R will use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. This is the first time the chipset appears in a globally marketed phone. Qualcomm says the chip is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">a major leap over the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, delivering 36% faster CPU performance, 11% improved graphics performance, and up to 46% better AI chops.</p><p>The 15R will sport a 1.5K AMOLED screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, which is higher than what most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> offer. The display also has a pixel density of 450 PPI and can reach up to 1800 nits of brightness, so visuals should stay sharp and clear even in bright light. This makes it great for gaming, streaming, or everyday use.</p><h2 id="battery-life-that-could-leave-flagships-in-the-dust-2">Battery life that could leave flagships in the dust</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cWdv43Qb2d2C5LZz3HmuXS" name="oneplus-15r-official-promo" alt="black and green OnePlus 15R showing their rear panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cWdv43Qb2d2C5LZz3HmuXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus hasn’t shared battery details yet, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-could-outlast-nearly-every-android-phone-with-a-massive-battery-upgrade">rumors point to an 8000mAh battery</a>. Leaks also mention a dual-lens camera with a 50 MP main sensor. The phone is expected to have IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K ratings for durability, matching or exceeding those of many top flagship phones.</p><p>Beyond just raw numbers: the 15R will ship globally in Charcoal Black and a fresh Mint Breeze green. The design seems to favor a clean metal frame and a camera module mounted at a 45-degree angle in the corner, giving it a distinct visual identity unlike OnePlus’s earlier phones.</p><p>The December 17 launch also includes the OnePlus Pad Go 2, which brings 5G to the budget tablet line. It offers a 12.1-inch 2.8K display with an anti-glare finish and stylus support.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch Lite will launch with a key feature: dual-phone pairing. It can connect to two Android phones or to an Android and an iPhone at the same time, making it useful for people who use more than one device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Our three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">highest-rated smart glasses</a> are <em>all</em> on deep discount, and the RayNeo Air 3s Pro is <em>even cheaper</em> now than it was on Black Friday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Pro-Glasses-SteamDeck/dp/B0FJRXSNWK/"><strong>down to an impressive $234</strong></a>. But Xreal and Viture are also offering compelling sales that aren't to be trifled with!</p><p>Xreal One, Viture Luma Pro, and RayNeo Air 3s Pro all provide you with a massive wearable OLED display in a svelte glasses form factor, allowing you to plug them into your smartphone, Steam Deck, laptop, or several other devices. That gives you a personal, private screen that won't hurt your neck. But how do you choose between the three? Price isn't the only answer!</p><p>Whether you're looking for the best image quality, lowest price, or widest range of compatible products, I'm here to help you make the right choice <em>today</em>.</p><h2 id="best-overall-smart-display-glasses-2">Best overall smart display glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP" name="xreal-one-side-angle-lenses-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One has been our top choice since it launched earlier this year. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One review</a> will help you understand what makes it the best if you want all the details, but the skinny is that Xreal One glasses come with the industry's first-ever dedicated chipset, allowing it to do things no other pair of glasses can. They're also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC"><strong>down to $399</strong></a>, the lowest price we've seen yet; a full $100 off!</p><p>Paramount to that experience is the ability to "mount" the virtual screen to an imaginary wall in front of you. When you plug Xreal One into any compatible device, the virtual screen in front of you stays in place just as a physical TV or monitor would, so you can move your head or body around normally, and that monitor will stay in place.</p><p>All other smart glasses "pin" the display to your face, which means that even the slightest jitter will make that display jostle and shake, and could give some people sore eyes or motion sickness. Xreal One's powerful chipset keeps this from happening, and the glasses even feature a built-in monitor-like settings menu that lets you fine-tune the image and several other options. Again, something no other pair of smart glasses can do.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bd6374aa-83a8-4a19-9b76-3d041fe5ce2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Take $100 off the normal price and enjoy the power of Xreal One with its dedicated, industry-first X1 chipset.

This dock is only guaranteed to work with Viture's glasses, so it's best to pair Luma Pro with them. Plus, since Luma Pro has the best micro-OLED display on any smart display glasses to date, you'll be thrilled with the image quality here.</p><p>Viture also makes a massive ecosystem of products that work with its glasses, from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">incredible mobile controller</a> that makes your phone display massive, to a crazy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Multi-screen-Assistant-12GB-256GB/dp/B0DRVPMT4T?th=1">Android-powered wearable neckband computer</a> that natively pairs with your glasses and enables remote PS5 play, plus access to other streaming services and Android games.

Not only does family get together to celebrate and watch football, but it also means that Christmas is right around the corner. It also means we're bound to see some steep discounts on some of our favorite devices, like being able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL/"><strong>save $700 on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></a>.</p><p>Most of the time, we don't see very many discounts on Samsung flagship devices once pre-orders have ended.

What we got was the thinnest foldable on the market, and that includes devices released abroad like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>.</p><p>While Samsung went in-house with the Exynos 2500 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/whoa-the-years-best-galaxy-z-flip-7-black-friday-deal-just-dropped-from-a-very-unlikely-source">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the company stuck with Qualcomm for the Fold 7. As such, we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at the helm, which is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This top-spec model is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/galaxy-z-fold7-1tb-unlocked-sku-sm-f966udbfxaa/">on sale for $600 off</a> as part of the Black Friday festivities.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, not only did Samsung introduce a completely overhauled design, but we also got a long-overdue camera upgrade. Samsung finally ditched the 50MP wide-angle lens from years past in favor of a 200MP sensor. This is joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto sensor with a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>In fact, the 200MP camera is the same sensor that you'll find in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is an enormous upgrade. If you're interested in seeing how the Z Fold 7 performs, we compared it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-camera-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>In our review, we gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> a 4.5/5 star rating, making this an easy recommendation for anyone who is interested in picking up one of the best foldable phones.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-67">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5615807595891508749&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1299702941074104322-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-7409176726029051954&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-7508986579345782498&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-5382800771118243653&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-6188419669973889380/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-7290658344113693644&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1259408622221942527&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Cyber Monday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, the company now seems to be rolling out a new RCS feature in Google Messages that could let employers view messages on company-managed Pixel phones.</p><p>As noted by Google in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/rcs-archival/">blog post</a>, the company is rolling out a new "RCS message archival" feature for fully-managed Google Pixel devices. According to Google, this will help organizations meet "strict compliance" requirements for record-keeping and legal requests for employee communications.</p><p>In simple terms, this means that if you use a company-managed Pixel phone, your employer may be able to see the messages you send and receive.</p><h2 id="google-enables-rcs-messages-logging-on-work-phones-2">Google enables RCS messages logging on work phones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TjSdYW3V6gP48WTatWigo4" name="Google Messages" alt="Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TjSdYW3V6gP48WTatWigo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-rcs-chat-samsung-phones">RCS</a>, as we all know, is the new standard for end-to-end encrypted messaging on Android and also enables secure texting with iPhones. While this is great for users, it has made it harder for organizations to meet compliance rules, since encrypted messaging breaks the old carrier-level logging systems. Previously, companies relied on carriers to log messages, but that's no longer possible.</p><p>To work around this issue, Google has introduced support for third-party archival apps that can integrate directly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-update-adds-slick-new-link-and-youtube-video-previews">Google Messages</a> on work-managed devices.</p><p>When enabled on an organization-owned Pixel, the archival app is notified whenever an RCS message is received. It's also notified when a message is sent, received, edited, or deleted.</p><p>Google mentions that the archival app <strong>can read the message data</strong> and make it available to the IT department. However, the company notes that everything remains end-to-end encrypted and the archival app doesn't share data online or with Google since the entire process happens on-device.</p><p>Google says it has already added support for third-party vendors including Celltrust, Smarsh, and 3rd Eye, with more coming next year.</p><p>That said, this feature is <strong>limited to company-managed devices</strong> and won't affect personal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Even on work devices, the feature must be enabled by IT administrators, and when it's active, employees will see a clear notification indicating that archival is running.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uzgexaa/"><strong>directly from Samsung</strong></a>, and you'll get a clean <strong>$560 off </strong>PLUS <strong>a free 512GB upgrade</strong>. It quite literally doesn't get better than that, and you don't need to trade anything in or sign a contract to get it!</p><p>To put this deal in perspective, <strong>Amazon is offering the 256GB model for $899</strong>, meaning you'll not only pay $40 more for the phone than Samsung is selling it for, but you'll also be getting <strong>half</strong> the amount of storage. The same scenario plays out at Best Buy, Walmart, and elsewhere.</p><p>In other words, if you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> this year, get it straight from Samsung and stop looking elsewhere.

We were sure this Black Friday deal was dead, but Samsung was generous enough to offer it on Cyber Monday for one last hurrah before the holiday season kicks into full swing. As a reminder, this is $560 off the 512GB version, giving you extra storage with an extra discount. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer/dp/B0DP3GQ4QY?th=1">Amazon - $899 (256GB model)</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-unlocked-titanium-black/J3ZYG25JP5">Best Buy - $899 (256GB model)</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s938uakexaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1ea7e331-c71d-4ad3-8988-2970490a6790" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,419.99" data-dimension48="$1,419.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're looking for a powerful flagship phone with top-tier specs, six more years of software support left, a camera that can zoom like no other, and wide compatibility with Samsung's vast ecosystem of products.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> or don't like phones with a boxy design.</p><p>Buying direct from Samsung is often one of the best ways to get any Samsung product, and that goes doubly for phones. Not only does the company offer Black Friday's best discount, but it doubles the storage, offers exclusive colors, and even allows you to trade in your old phone or finance the device to make it easier to purchase.</p><p>I'd recommend buying unlocked through Samsung, as the carrier variants of the phone don't seem to offer any additional discounts over today's ludicrous sale. An unlocked phone typically resells for a higher value down the road, and also offers you the chance to easily switch carriers at any time without having to deal with their BS.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It has also been a user-favorite, since it's easy to start casting from your phone to the big screen while keeping playback controls on your phone.</p><p>However, with most streaming services now offering full-featured and complex apps, casting support has taken a back seat. Even Google hasn't focused much on Chromecast lately, and now it appears streaming services are pulling back as well, with Netflix reportedly removing Cast support on newer Google TV and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Chromecast devices</a>.</p><p>As spotted by users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ox7in3/rant_netflix_no_long_has_casting_support_you_must/">Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-casting-chromecast-google-tv-streamer-3620784/">Android Authority</a>), many have reported that the Cast button in the Netflix app has disappeared when trying to stream to Chromecast devices.

I switched to Reolink instead and found it to be much better in just about every way, and there's a new entrant that's aiming to be an alternative. I use dozens of Baseus products throughout the house, and I have a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-S1-Pro-Sunlight-Tracking-Expandable/dp/B0D12DN7LP">S1 Pro cameras</a> that are positioned outdoors.</p><p>Baseus has a new S2 camera, and it has a few extras: it shoots 4K footage, and it doesn't rely on a base station — you can just slot in a MicroSD slot and record footage to the camera, accessing it from anywhere. The best feature is the integrated solar panel that allows the camera's internal battery to recharge itself. The result is that you'll never have to worry about charging the camera, and that alone is a huge bonus. The S2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Security-Cameras-Wireless-Outdoor/dp/B0FDB48N8J">now available for just $89</a>, making it an even better recommendation.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b3133824-d4ae-41c1-b359-fa2680b77c4e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The S2 does a good job with motion detection, and the built-in solar panel automatically charges the battery.

Having a tiny solar panel integrated means you don't really need to plug this thing in, and it records clear 4K footage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need Google Home integration.</p><p>The S2 is extremely easy to set up and use, and I didn't have any problems in this area. The integration of a solar panel makes using it that much easier, and the panel rotates automatically based on the positioning of the sun. It allows the built-in battery to recharge automatically, and it's good enough that you don't have to charge the camera even after months of use.</p><p>The camera has a decent sensor that records 4K footage, and you can store it locally by slotting in a MicroSD slot. I would've liked to see Google Home integration, as that's basically the only feature missing on this camera — otherwise, it does a great job. At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Security-Cameras-Wireless-Outdoor/dp/B0FDB48N8J">just $89</a>, it's a pretty good value as well right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I have several Nexode GaN chargers and power banks on hand around the house, and it's safe to say that the brand has proven to be reliable.</p><p>That's why I was excited when UGREEN said it was introducing Qi 2.2 MagFlow chargers that go up to 25W. Look, I wasn't really keen on Qi 2 charging until the Pixel 10 Pro XL showed up, but in the last three months, I used wireless chargers more than any other time in the last decade. It's just convenient to be able to do so, and with the standard now going up to 25W, it isn't an excruciating wait until a phone is charged.</p><p>Anyway, I've been using UGREEN's MagFlow chargers for the better part of three months now, and they're terrific. There are several models; I got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Wireless-Certified-Charging-Travel-Friendly/dp/B0DZX46DJ3">charging mat that costs $29</a>, and a 10,000mAh power bank with a built-in cable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Charging-Magnetic/dp/B0F37VLJQW">that's now down to $59</a>. But the ones I used the most are the 3-in-1 MagFlow foldable charging stand — which is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Foldable-Wireless-Ultra-Compact-Pocket-Size/dp/B0DZX533Y1">available for $89 as part of Cyber Monday</a> — and a 3-in-1 MagFlow charging station that sits next to my desk, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-W711-Desktop-Wireless-Charger/dp/B0DQKHPPBJ">which costs $93</a>.</p><p>Both charging stands let you charge a phone at 25W over the Qi 2.2 protocol, along with other accessories like earbuds, and the Apple Watch. It's this last addition that made the foldable charging stand a mainstay in my travel bag; it's just easy to be able to charge three devices at once, and I don't have to bring my Apple Watch charging cable around.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ca2d6312-f523-4c56-9be6-952157c4cfd7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get this if you need a travel-friendly Qi 2 charging accessory.

the one I used the most. It isn't hard to see why; the design makes it easy to take anywhere, and when folded, it is smaller than a phone. I like the design as well; it's elegant, and the build quality is fantastic.</p><p>The Qi 2 mat is located at the top, and you get the Apple Watch charging puck at the bottom alongside another mat that charges accessories at 5W. The charging stand needs 45W of power, and it has the ability to charge phones at up to 25W over Qi 2.2, buds at 5W, and the Apple Watch at 5W. I used it with my Apple Watch Series 11, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, and other Android phones, and it has been terrific.</p><p>With Cyber Monday bringing the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Foldable-Wireless-Ultra-Compact-Pocket-Size/dp/B0DZX533Y1">3-in-1 foldable charging stand down to $89</a>, now is the best time to pick it up. I was hesitant to recommend it at launch as it debuted at $139, but that is no longer an issue — but you will need to act now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like what TerraMaster is doing with NAS servers in general; the brand polished its software last year, delivering a clean interface with plenty of useful features. At the same time, it refreshed its design, with new models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f4-424-max-review">F4-424 Max</a> coming with a sleek design and better ventilation.</p><p>Where the brand really stands out is with its all-SSD enclosures such as the F8 SSD and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">F8 SSD Plus</a>, and they let you make the switch to M.2 storage with minimum hassle. Now, TerraMaster took the idea of the F4 SSD and turned it into just a storage drive, resulting in the D4 SSD. This is just an SSD enclosure that can house four 8TB M.2 2280 drives, giving you 32TB of storage.</p><p>The D4 SSD doesn't have any internal hardware, so you can't use it as a NAS. However, if you need to extend the storage of your Windows or macOS notebook or just want an all-SSD external storage drive that you can connect via USB-C, the D4 SSD is a pretty great choice. And right now, the D4 SSD is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-D4-SSD-NVMe-Enclosure/dp/B0F8BFGXK9">down to $239 for Cyber Monday</a>, which is $60 off its usual selling price of $299.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="76627e7b-d978-43ae-89b6-2a4ac927e1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="If you need an SSD enclosure that looks good and has all the bandwidth you need, the D4 SSD should be your go-to choice." data-dimension48="If you need an SSD enclosure that looks good and has all the bandwidth you need, the D4 SSD should be your go-to choice." data-dimension25="$239.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-D4-SSD-NVMe-Enclosure/dp/B0F8BFGXK9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.97%;"><img id="tbhLSWsmbycPUB7mmBDuV7" name="TerraMaster D4 SSD" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tbhLSWsmbycPUB7mmBDuV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="772" height="656" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>If you need an SSD enclosure that looks good and has all the bandwidth you need, the D4 SSD should be your go-to choice. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-D4-SSD-NVMe-Enclosure/dp/B0F8BFGXK9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="76627e7b-d978-43ae-89b6-2a4ac927e1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="If you need an SSD enclosure that looks good and has all the bandwidth you need, the D4 SSD should be your go-to choice." data-dimension48="If you need an SSD enclosure that looks good and has all the bandwidth you need, the D4 SSD should be your go-to choice." data-dimension25="$239.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a robust SSD enclosure. The D4 SSD needs external power, and it can easily slot in four M.2 SSDs. It connects over just about any USB standard: USB 3.0, USB 3.1, USB 3.2, USB 4, and Thunderbolt 3/4/5. Regardless of what device you connect it to, you will be able to take advantage of this enclosure.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a portable SSD storage drive. As it needs to be plugged in, the D4 SSD isn't portable.</p><p>The D4 SSD looks nearly identical to the F4 SSD, and what I like the most about it is that there's active cooling — which is a must-have in an SSD enclosure. It's easy to slot in SSDs into the device, and it has good passive airflow thanks to the vents located up top. You get a built-in fan, but it isn't loud, so if you have this positioned on a desk, it's not going to annoy you.</p><p>The D4 SSD has the ability to house four NVMe drives, going up to 8TB each. That means you get 32TB of addressable storage, and that is higher than what's possible with most products in this category. The only issue is that the D4 SSD isn't portable; it needs to be connected to a wall outlet, so you can't just throw it in a bag and take it around.</p><p>Connectivity is where the D4 SSD truly shines, with the USB-C port integrating all USB standards, including USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and USB 4.0. It also gets Thunderbolt 5, Thunderbolt 4, and Thunderbolt 3, so you can be guaranteed that you can use this thing with just about any device. With a 40Gbps bandwidth, you can easily move data to and from the device, and it is an ideal choice if you need a fast external drive to store videos — that's how I used the D4 SSD over the last six months.</p><p>Obviously, the bandwidth is reliant on the drives you slot in, and I used the D4 SSD with WD's excellent SN770 Gen 4 SSDs, and it proved to be a great choice. If you want to extend the storage of your workstation and need an all-SSD solution, the D4 SSD gets my recommendation. With the deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-D4-SSD-NVMe-Enclosure/dp/B0F8BFGXK9">bringing it down to $239</a>, now is as good a time as any to buy the enclosure.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Among the reasons is the presence of physical buttons, something that's not super common on even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. I'm not a fan of capacitive buttons, so this is a huge plus for me. In addition to standalone volume buttons, the 'b' buttons can be customized for switching audio modes or triggering your AI assistant.</p><p>Also, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a>, these are built for exercise and other physical activity, making them some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best fitness earbuds</a> we've tested. The earhooks ensure that they fit extremely well while you're on a run, and you get five eartip sizes so you can get a good seal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="n9dTVwyHh78Ec3hyDMGKTV" name="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-volume-rocker.JPG" alt="Powerbeats Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n9dTVwyHh78Ec3hyDMGKTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had the Powerbeats Pro 2 for a few days now, but so far I'm thoroughly enjoying them. Audio sounds fantastic, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/tech-talk-what-is-anc-and-how-does-it-work">ANC</a> is better than I expected. I also like the transparency mode, as it's easy to activate and makes voices very clear, so I don't have ot take out my earbuds when speaking to others.</p><p>The battery also lasts a long time, and the charging case adds up to 45 hours of battery life. Oh, and did I mention that it can monitor your heart rate and connect to other apps/workout equipment? That's right, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have built-in heart rate sensors for better workout tracking, adding even more value to an already-impressive pair of earbuds.</p><p>I use Android, so the Powerbeats Pro's functionality is somewhat limited, but I still find them a joy to use. However, if you're an iPhone user, there are even more reasons to enjoy them. One of my iPhone-toting friends told me that they preferred these to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">Apple's AirPods Pro,</a> and I already convinced another friend to purchase them since she does a lot of physical activity.</p><p>The only thing I don't like about these earbuds is the fact that the charging case is so large. I'd hate to carry these around without a bag or purse to put them in.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-72">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's wireless earbuds haven't always impressed me, but the brand's wireless over-hear headphones are arguably the best-value options on the market. I already told you about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/cmf-headphone-pro-best-budget-anc-over-ear-deal">$79 deal for the CMF Headphone Pro</a> — which is <em>somehow</em> still live on Amazon after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>. However, if you want to pay a bit more for a pair of headphones with way better sound and ANC, you should be looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing Headphone 1</a>.</p><p>I thought the Nothing Headphone 1's $299 price point was aggressive when the headphones first came out. They're good enough to rival headphones like the Sonos Ace, Sony WH-1000XM6, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2, and AirPods Max, while being considerable cheaper. That's why it's shocking that Nothing cut an extra $60 off Headphone 1 for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday</a>, bringing the headphones down to just $239 if you move fast.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d04c9283-f7ac-4fe9-af9c-b0409044b87b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Walmart - $239" data-dimension48="Walmart - $239" data-dimension25="$239" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Headphone-Cancelling-Headphones-KEF-Tuned/dp/B0F66XD5LF/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3PU44EwYbpbBWdBP4Bu9o4" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-Black" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3PU44EwYbpbBWdBP4Bu9o4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Nothing blew into the over-ear headphone scene with Headphone 1, a wireless ANC offering with audio tuning from KEF. It'll last up to 80 hours with ANC off, and has an eight-band EQ in the Nothing X companion app for audio personalization. Plus, it features Nothing's stunning transparent design. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nothing-headphone-1-black/16560723708" target="_blank" data-dimension112="d04c9283-f7ac-4fe9-af9c-b0409044b87b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Walmart - $239" data-dimension48="Walmart - $239" data-dimension25="$239">Walmart - $239</a> | <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/headphone-1?variant=46734988738712" target="_blank">Nothing - $239</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Headphone-Cancelling-Headphones-KEF-Tuned/dp/B0F66XD5LF/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d04c9283-f7ac-4fe9-af9c-b0409044b87b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Walmart - $239" data-dimension48="Walmart - $239" data-dimension25="$239">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a stylish pair of over-ear headphones that stand out; you like a bass-heavy sound profile with a great EQ; you want tactile buttons for simple control.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> the 3.5mm jack requires battery power for analog connection; sound might need some tuning out of the box.</p><h2 id="what-i-like-about-nothing-s-headphone-1-2">What I like about Nothing's Headphone 1</h2><p>Every good pair of headphones offers great sound, but there's something special about the Nothing Headphone 1. Surprisingly, it's not that the out-of-the-box sound signature is excellent. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-headphone-1-one-of-the-best-audio-products-of-2025">My colleague Harish loves it,</a> but I'd slightly prefer a more balanced profile. That leads to the best part about the Headphone 1 — they're incredibly easy to personalize with a detailed eight-band EQ in the Nothing X app.</p><p>You can quickly pick a few preset EQ options to immediately change the sound, or adjust each of the eight EQ bands separately with precise control. I can turn the "more treble" preset on to instantly make the Headphone 1 sound exactly how I want, with balance between the lows and highs.</p><p>The entire experience is backed by a custom 40mm dynamic driver enclosed with 8.9mm of polyurethane to limit distortion.</p><p>Then, there are the Headphone 1's intangibles and design, which you can appreciate regardless of whether you're deep in the Nothing ecosystem. You get comfortable, soft ear cushions, an aluminum shell, and a clear plastic covering that reveals a crafted transparent design. If you have a Nothing phone already, it'll match like no other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-11" alt="Wearing the Nothing Headphone 1 while holding up the Nothing Phone 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/awEcSoSpMb8jFPtxNEjGxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nothing Headphone 1 feels comfortable and light, although its official 329-gram weight is technically on the heavier side. It goes to show how well-distributed the weight is across the headband and pads. Additionally, there is support for hi-res audio codecs like LDAC and 35-hour battery life with ANC on.</p><p>Throw it all together, and Headphone 1 are a steal even at full price.

Smart shopping saves you money, but it's also a way to build your own kit of gear that "just works."</p><p>You don't have to use the same brand for everything, but you might want to.</p><h2 id="why-you-might-want-the-whole-ecosystem-2">Why you might want the whole ecosystem</h2><p>We all know that you can use any phone, any laptop, any tablet, and so on, and things can work together to make life a little bit easier. But there's often a benefit to buying products from the same company.</p><p>Some, like Apple's products, have features that only work with other stuff from the same company. If you want to use Siri, HomeKit, or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rcs-vs-sms-vs-imessage-whats-difference">iMessage</a>, you need an Apple product. Period. It feels kind of like a tech jail, I know. It also allows the company behind it all to do more.</p><p>Take iMessage as an example. Because it only works with Apple products, it can work with <em>all of your Apple products</em>. You can get the same messages on your phone, your tablet, and even your laptop because they were all built with that exact purpose in mind.</p><p>Apple's the first "offender" that may come to mind, but it's not alone here. Samsung, Google, and Amazon - the big players in the tech gadget and gizmo scene - each offer something that either works best with the same brand or only works with the same brand. It's been that way for a while, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:967px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="QnsHZqUGxpxcr6Nc9sntwk" name="pixelbook.JPG" alt="Google Pixelbook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnsHZqUGxpxcr6Nc9sntwk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="967" height="543" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm torn on how I feel about all this, and you might be too. Google famously builds services and features that are designed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">work on every screen</a>, and that's handy. But Google's products often feel lacking when it comes to the competition, and not everything from the company is built for other products to use. Maybe you want to read your SMS messages on your watch, even though they were sent to the number used for your phone. Or you want the kind of synchronicity you get between a Galaxy S25 and a Galaxy Book.</p><p>The only way to guarantee that you'll have that, and whatever comes in the future, is to buy "all Samsung" or "all Apple".</p><p>That's not necessarily a bad thing. I doubt anyone would complain if they had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/i-dont-think-tablets-can-get-any-better-than-the-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab</a>, and a pretty and thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">Galaxy Book</a> in their bag to use — ditto for a big stack of " Apple i-products" or a satchel full of Pixel gear. It's good stuff that works best together.</p><p>The problem arises when you didn't think of it in advance (like me) and have a Motorola phone, an Acer Chromebook, an Apple iPad, a Pixel watch, and an Amazon TV. Everything still works, just not as well as it all could. I love my phone and everything else, but I won't lie and say I don't see things from other companies that I wish I had.</p><p>This is only going to expand, too. Now that every company is throwing as many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-in-motion-the-road-to-ai-and-the-future-of-mobile">AI products </a>at us as possible, they need to find a way to stand out; you know, just like Google does with the AI features that only work on a Pixel. Expect to see something similar from every company with the means to make it happen; we already know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ai-os-what-it-could-or-should-be">Nothing has something up its sleeve,</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazon-is-about-to-drop-vega-os-on-fire-tv-sooner-than-expected">Amazon isn't shifting to a new OS</a> for fun.</p><p>If you care about making the most of your tech gear, sales season is a big help. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/still-havent-settled-on-a-cyber-monday-phone-deal-this-is-the-one-id-buy">Cyber Monday</a> means you'll find gadgets from every company at super low prices. All you need to do is decide which way you want to go.</p><p>If I were going to go all in with one brand and squeeze every feature I could out of an ecosystem, I'd be looking at two specific products: a Pixel 10 Pro and an iPhone Air. Not because I think these products are better than all the others, but because they could be the foundation for something that works great together and offers something I want: access to everything Gemini or all my messages on everything I own.</p><p>When the next big sale comes along, I'd look for other products from the same company. Soon I would have the products I use most - a phone, a wearable, and a laptop - designed to work best when used as a group.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3469px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ruxqkP4xESvmADZCsm8UxN" name="samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025" alt="Galaxy Unpacked banner in New York City" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ruxqkP4xESvmADZCsm8UxN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3469" height="1952" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not suggesting that anyone should do this, and you chase whatever dream you have.

It's unclear what it will actually be named or when exactly it will release, but Samsung has already began teasing the upcoming foldable. One thing we've come to expect, though, is that the Galaxy Z TriFold will be expensive. Some rumors have pointed to the Galaxy Z TriFold starting at $3,000, but a new leak could offer a more promising outlook for interested buyers.</p><p>In a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.naver.com/yeux1122/224091169522" target="_blank">Naver</a>, Korean blogger yeux1122 claimed the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will cost about 3.6 million won in South Korea (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-tri-fold-foldable-new-price-leak-3620378/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). While currency conversions aren't an exact way to determine regional pricing, 3.6 million won equals about $2,446. Previously, the Galaxy Z TriFold was tipped to start at 4 million won, or roughly $2,718.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="jyVxK7eoRGdwgMqW5iUYs7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-trifold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold leaks again" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jyVxK7eoRGdwgMqW5iUYs7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SBS News)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If accurate, this leak suggests the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold might be priced around $2,500 in the U.S. Earlier rumors predicted the Galaxy Z TriFold could cost $3,000 or more, which would be quite the sticker shock. For perspective, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 starts at $2,000. The rumored $2,500 price point for the Galaxy Z TriFold would add a 25% premium over the Fold 7, whereas the possible $3,000 price point represents a 50% increase.</p><p>Of course, $2,500 is still a lot of money for a smartphone, but it doesn't sound as outlandish. That's especially true when you consider the Galaxy Z TriFold is intended to be a multipurpose device that could open up to reveal a 10-inch display panel for multitasking, entertainment, and productivity. Another reference point for tri-fold pricing is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, which isn't sold in the U.S., but would go for around $3,600 if it did.</p><h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-become-official-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold become official?</h2><p>We might not have to wait much longer for official details on the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifolding-phone-could-launch-dec-2025">unveil its newest foldable as soon as Dec. 5</a>, and that's when we'll learn official pricing and availability info. For now, we'll have to consider these dueling pricing leaks with a bit of caution. Either could end up being true, but foldable fans will probably hope for the $2,500 Galaxy Z TriFold to become a reality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The answer is simple, really: it's just a well-rounded machine. This is the case with many of Lenovo's other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2025">Chromebooks</a>, regardless of how cheap, or expensive, they can get.</p><p>With the Slim 3 in particular, you're getting a 14-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution which makes for a nice and crisp screen. While this model in particular doesn't feature a touchscreen, that's not really a bother since you can't flip the screen back and use it as a tablet anyways.</p><p>As for performance, we have the MediaTek Kompanio 520 at the helm, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. This is usually the point where I would tell you to stay away, but Lenovo found magic in a bottle here. No, you won't be able to have a slew of app windows and Chrome tabs open at the same time, but it's great for lighter browsing.</p><p>What seals the deal for me is the battery life. Lenovo rates the Slim 3 Chromebook to last for more than 13 hours, and that's even with a 1080p display. A lot of times, I'll see a cheap Chromebook rated to last that long, only to find out that it's using a 720p screen, which isn't exactly ideal.</p><h2 id="cyber-monday-2025-quick-links-97">Cyber Monday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Cyber Monday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Cyber Monday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The user said that as soon as they opened the sharing menu to send a file, the Wi-Fi disconnected. And when they try to reconnect while the menu is open, the network list shows their network, but they won't connect to it.</p><p>According to several reports so far, this issue stems from the new Quick Share extension update (1.0.815689706). According to another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1p3320u/wifi_drooping_issues_after_installing_quick_share/">user on Reddit</a>, their Pixel 10 Pro XL began malfunctioning immediately after the Quick Share extension update. After a quick troubleshooting of the extension, they were able to confirm that the Wi-Fi issue stemmed from this update alone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-side-01" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uVPvRdGgC9SE7kcFMPTVa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What could likely be causing this issue, according to Gemini, is that the standard Wi-Fi hardware (like in the Pixel) is usually built for Wi-Fi Direct (a standard protocol). But now with this new update, Google could be forcing this hardware to mimic <strong>AWDL</strong> (a proprietary Apple protocol), which could be causing the network to get glitchy and drop out.</p><p>While Google hasn't yet officially addressed the issue, some temporary workarounds are being passed around that could help fix this issue. Pixel 10 users have two options to choose from: You can either choose to get rid of this extension until a fix arrives, by heading to <strong>Settings > Apps > See all apps</strong>, locating the "Quick Share extension," and selecting "Uninstall updates."</p><p>Or, if you urgently need to send a file to an Apple device, you can temporarily bypass this by turning off the Wi-Fi manually before opening the Quick Share menu; this forces the transfer to happen via Bluetooth or mobile data, though you may need to restart your phone afterward to connect back to your Wi-Fi.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issue, and we'll update this article once we have more information.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google has stealthily slashed access limits for its popular Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro tools, adjusting free-tier users' daily prompts amid soaring demand, leaving many to navigate new restrictions without prior warning in a rapidly changing digital landscape.</p><p>Since its debut, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> used to let you make five prompts a day, but now Google only promises “basic access,” meaning the limits can change based on demand. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a> also cut the number of free image creations from three to two per day. Google didn’t make a big announcement about these changes; they just showed up on the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16275805" target="_blank">support page</a>, first noticed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/27/gemini-3-pro-free-limits/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>More people are using Gemini 3 Pro than Google probably expected. The model offers better reasoning, more features, and clearer visuals thanks to Nano Banana Pro’s improved rendering engine.</p><p>This high demand puts a lot of strain on Google’s servers, especially since access is free. To avoid problems, Google is quietly reducing free access so the platform keeps working well for everyone.</p><p>The move also nudges heavier users — people who rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> for research, writing, or content creation — toward paid upgrades like Google's $20/month AI Pro Plan if they want stable performance and consistent access to the top-tier model.</p><h2 id="forced-downgrade-2">Forced downgrade</h2><p>Under these new limits, free users aren’t locked out entirely, but hitting the cap now pushes them back to Google’s Fast model.</p><p>NotebookLM is also running into some capacity issues, as per Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/1993387297081827346" target="_blank">post on X</a>, so a few of its smarter tools are getting dialed back for now. Free users can’t access Infographics or Slide Decks at the moment, and even Pro subscribers are seeing new limits to help keep the service stable for everyone.</p><p>For casual users, these new limits might not be a problem. If you only ask a question or two each day, you may never reach the cap. But people who use Gemini 3 Pro for daily work will notice the restrictions right away.</p><p>The situation is even more frustrating because there’s no clear indicator of how many prompts remain — the system simply switches models when it decides you’ve had enough for the day.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>A key perk of buying a phone, watch, or tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">through T-Mobile</a> is the ability to spread device payments over monthly installment plans and earn promotional credits in the process. Notably, while competitors increased the lengths of their installment plans to 36 months, T-Mobile's installments — officially called equipment installment plans (EIPs) — remained at 24 months and 0% interest. Now, it looks like T-Mobile is finally following in its competitors' footsteps, and is launching 36-month installment plans  for certain products.</p><p>This doesn't come as a major surprise, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> mistakenly added 36-month installment plans to its website in June 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2025/06/t-mobile-might-be-switching-to-36-month-installments/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>. Those quickly disappeared and the 24-month terms remained until this weekend, when T-Mobile rolled out 36-month installment plans for smartwatches and tablets. Customers now only have the option of paying for their device in full or choosing a T-Mobile installment plan with a term length of three years.</p><p>The updated terms heavily incentives T-Mobile subscribers to remain with the carrier for the length of the installment plan, and avoid upgrading their devices earlier. Like many carriers, T-Mobile entices users to sign up for installment plans by offering credits and promotions that lower the overall cost of a new device. Those "get a new phone on us" deals only apply when you sign up for an installment plan.</p><p>Signing up for a T-Mobile installment plan technically doesn't lock you into paying for your phone service for the full three years. However,  those promotional device credits are paid out on a monthly basis. That means if you cancel service or need to upgrade your device early, you'll be on the hook for the remaining installment plan balance. In other words, people who buy tablets and smartwatches through T-Mobile installment plans can only upgrade every three years now, as opposed to two, if they want to get all their promotional credits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ" name="t-mobile-postpaid-magenta-on-s20.jpg" alt="T-Mobile Magenta plan information on an S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The change is yet another occurrence where T-Mobile is caught using tactics it previously mocked competing carriers for employing. Just earlier this month, T-Mobile's consumer group president acknowledged how 36-month installment plans limit upgrades and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-switch-carriers-att-t-mobile-verizon-sprint">carrier-switching</a> at the Wells Fargo Summit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/t-mobile-36-months-installments-eips-tablets-watches_id176095" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>).</p><div><blockquote><p>Remember, there was, you know, two of our competitors had, you know, introduced financing constructs over 36 months. That probably artificially suppressed some of the upgrade activity, some of the switching activity in the marketplace.</p><p>John Freier, President T-Mobile Consumer Group</p></blockquote></div><p>The big question is whether T-Mobile's longer installment plans will eventually extend to smartphones. For now, the 36-month term lengths only apply to tablets and smartwatches. If applied to smartphone plans in the future, T-Mobile would lose yet another differentiating factor between it and competitors like AT&T and Verizon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Typically, Samsung's device colors offer their distinct coloring on the back panel, leaving the frame with a lighter, almost metal hue. What Ice Universe suggests is that Samsung will change its darkest hue by wrapping the coloring over its edges, especially around its display.</p><p>The tipster states, "This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame." However, it seems consumers might be in for a slight visual anomaly if this happens.</p><p>The post on X states, "overall visual bezel is inevitably wider," because of the black edges around the display. The bezels are the black border around a display, a distinct marker that separates the display from its edges. If that <em>and </em>the frame is black, it might give the illusion that the S26 Ultr has massive bezels, when that (might not) be the case.</p><p>User comments on X have gone separate ways, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/emn_mora/status/1994011013981548727?s=20">some users praising</a> this potential, while others claim we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joemama_0609/status/1993877598196388200?s=20">headed for scratch central</a>. Another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1993865319237210232?s=20">theonecid</a>, chimed in with a mock-up rendering of what a true Jet Black Galaxy S26 Ultra could look like. The frame is a little glossy, not quite as matte as what the series currently offers. It remains to be seen what Samsung truly does with the colors next year.</p><h2 id="looking-to-26-2">Looking to '26</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This time, the Galaxy S26 Ultra black version features a black frame, not the lighter silver, so the overall visual bezel is inevitably wider.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1993859554291896566">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-leak">had some renders</a> for the Galaxy S26 Ultra leak before, though these were more about the possible design changes Samsung could implement. It's currently rumored that the S26 Ultra may adopt a more Galaxy Z Fold 7-style approach by adding that little island beneath its vertically lined cameras. This would, as you'd expect, give a bit of a camera bump, which the S25 Ultra lacks, aside from the camera protrusions.</p><p>Everything else, such as button placements, remains relatively the same in those leaks.</p><p>A more recent whispering from November claims that the S26 Ultra may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultras-new-design-could-change-how-selfies-are-taken">change how users take selfies</a>. The selfie camera itself isn't rumored to change (big surprise), but what is potentially changing is the size of the lens cutout. Rumors claim the size could increase to 4mm, meaning users could have a slightly wider FOV (field of view) for their selfies.</p> ]]></dc:content>
