Live and learn, right? </p><p>As of this morning, if you buy the Meta Quest 3S 128GB during the holiday sale <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/meta-quest-3s-128gb-the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-bundle-dive-into-virtual-reality-white/J3LHRV8HL7"><strong>Best Buy will give you $50 off the price along with a free copy of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, three months of Meta Horizon Plus, AND a free $50 gift card</strong></a> to spend on anything you'd like. All things said and done, you're looking at $144 of total savings. Considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> was already the most approachable headset on the market, this deal presents an incredible opportunity for anyone who's ready to dip their toes into VR gaming.

Now that you have $50 of free Best Buy cash to spend, why not level up your new VR headset with some <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3S accessories</a>?</p><p>Meta's own Elite Strap is a popular choice, adding extra comfort and adjustability with up to two hours of extra battery life on a single charge. Days before Black Friday, Best Buy is dropping $26 off the price of the strap. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/quest-elite-strap-with-battery-works-with-meta-quest-3-3s-up-to-2-extra-hours-playtime/J3LHRV8Q7H/sku/6570194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1940cbf9-738c-4b95-a985-81ea10faac07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest Elite Strap with Battery: $129.99" data-dimension48="Meta Quest Elite Strap with Battery: $129.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Of course, I'm still eagerly waiting for a Black Friday discount on the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, but this deal is the next best thing. The affordable Meta Quest 3S boasts the same graphical processing power as its more-expensive big sibling, plus you get slightly better battery life, an improved facial interface for added comfort, and some upgraded low light tracking capabilities. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> also share the same Snapdragon chipset and 8GB of RAM, and you'll have access to the same library of games. </p><p>The regular Meta Quest 3 is still better than the Quest 3S in a few areas, namely resolution and FOV. The standard model also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack (which the Quest 3S lacks), and the Quest 3's pancake lenses generally offer a more next-gen experience than the 3S' Fresnel lens design. </p><p>You could compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs the Quest 3</a> until you're blue in the face, but in my opinion, it all comes down to price. If you're new to VR gaming or shopping for someone else this holiday season, I'd argue that the Quest 3S offers much more bang for the buck. Add on $144 of savings and purchasing the affordable headset becomes a no-brainer. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 and older models prompt you to set up life-saving safety and emergency features. Since you probably skipped that step to start playing with your new smartwatch, you need help setting up these features <em>now</em>, so that your Watch 4 can signal for help during a crisis, even in cellular dead zones.</p><p>You can update your emergency and medical info in two places. On your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>, swipe down from the main watch face, tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>, and scroll down to the <strong>Safety & Emergency menu</strong>. Or in the Pixel Watch mobile app, if your smartwatch is synced via Bluetooth, you'll find the same Safety & Emergency menu under <strong>Settings</strong> on the main app page.</p><p>Some Pixel Watch 4 features are automated; others require manual setup ahead of time, like Safety Check. This how-to guide runs through the Watch 4's surprisingly robust list of safety features that'll give you and your loved ones peace of mind — or potentially save your life.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-customize-emergency-sos-on-the-pixel-watch-4"><span>Set up and customize Emergency SOS on the Pixel Watch 4</span></h3><ol class="recipe-instruction-list" class="recipe-instruction-list" start="1"><li>On your Watch 4 (or older Pixel Watch model), open your <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll to <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>, and tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. If it isn't already, toggle the feature on.</li><li>Tap <strong>Ways to start SOS</strong>. By default, you must press the crown five times, then touch and hold the screen for three seconds. You can instead have the Watch 4 <strong>Automatically call</strong>; after the five button presses, it'll call 911 after a five-second delay.<ol><li>If you choose the latter option, decide whether to toggle <strong>Play a sound</strong> on or off; it's a loud chiming noise to warn you that it's about to call, with an option to cancel on the display.</li></ol></li><li>Lastly, choose <strong>Who to call for help</strong>. By default, Emergency SOS dials <strong>Emergency services</strong>, but you can instead choose a personal contact by tapping <strong>Manage contacts</strong> and choosing an option from your saved contacts.</li></ol><p>Switching to a personal contact makes Emergency SOS less "official." You have a quick shortcut to contact family members for help, with no fee for an ambulance or escalation to police, but there's no guarantee that they'll <em>answer</em> your call or respond quickly like 911 would.</p><p>I recommend leaving 911 as the default option. You can rely upon the <strong>Personal Safety</strong> app to contact family members.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-choose-what-information-is-shared-in-an-emergency"><span>Choose what information is shared in an emergency</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tRt3GY5SdEV8eBd5FKZDbT" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-personal-safety-app" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 showing the Personal Safety app, with Emergency Sharing and Safety Check options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRt3GY5SdEV8eBd5FKZDbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ol class="recipe-instruction-list" class="recipe-instruction-list" start="1"><li>Press the <strong>crown</strong> and select the <strong>Personal Safety</strong> app.</li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Emergency info access</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Share during emergency call</strong> to allow "Emergency Location Service" to share your GPS location and Medical Info with emergency responders.</li><li>Back in the main app view, tap <strong>Emergency contacts</strong> to manage your contacts; tap <strong>Add contact</strong> to add more or the trash can icon to remove contacts.</li><li>In the main app view, tap <strong>Medical Info</strong> and then <strong>Edit on phone</strong>.</li><li>On your connected device, you can add your <strong>date of birth, blood type, height, weight, allergies, pregnancy status, medications, address, organ donor status, and any other medical notes</strong>.

In fact, you can't enable Qi2 even by using a case. Only standard Qi wireless charging is supported.</p></article></section><h2 id="the-oneplus-15-settled-for-a-larger-battery-over-qi2-charging-2">The OnePlus 15 settled for a larger battery over Qi2 charging</h2><p>Battery life was clearly one of the top priorities when designing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>, and it shows. The massive 7,300mAh capacity commands a lot of space in the phone and since OnePlus didn't want it to feel like a brick in your pocket, it decided to ditch Qi2 charging. Rudolf Xu, senior product marketing manager at OnePlus, told Android Central that adding magnets in the phone would have made it too heavy and that they needed the space for the battery.</p><p>What's really surprising, though, is that the OnePlus 15 isn't even "Qi2 ready," which means you can't enable Qi2 charging even with a case. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series doesn't have built-in magnetic charging either, but it is Qi2-ready, which means you can do 15W wireless magnetic charging using the right case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC" name="oneplus-15-never-settle" alt="OnePlus's Never Settle logo on a OnePlus 15's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is this going to be a huge deal-breaker for most buyers? Probably not. The OnePlus 15 can charge at 50W wirelessly, which beats even the Qi2 25W standard, but you'll have to buy OnePlus' special wireless charger separately to enable this. There's also a ridiculously fast 120W wired charging speed (80W in the U.S.), and that charging brick comes in the box. Fast magnetic charging would have been nice to have, which would have made the OnePlus 15 work well with many existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> in the market.</p><p>While the OnePlus 15 scores big points on power and battery life, some other aspects have taken a back seat in order to keep the pricing nearly the same as the 13. The display has a slightly lower resolution than before, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera performance</a> doesn't break any new ground.

These deal prices may or may not last to Black Friday, but we can guarantee they won't fall any <em>lower</em> by November 28. So there's no reason to wait!</p><p>You'll find some major discounts like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-f%C4%93nix%C2%AE-Multisport-Long-Lasting-Built/dp/B0DD5PTPT8"><strong>$250 off the Fenix 8</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Performance-Smartwatch-Technology-Flashlight/dp/B0BYFBB2GQ"><strong>$450 off the Epix Pro (Gen 2)</strong></a>, if you want steel style and the newest features like a mic/ speaker, flashlight, and newer sensors.

Specifically, you're a self-guided runner who wants help improving your VO2 Max and hitting race PRs, and who cares more about their running watch feeling comfortable than looking "stylish."</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You're willing to trade away a week of battery life and certain premium features, downgrading to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1T9J4Y"><strong>Forerunner 265 for $299 (also $150 off)</strong></a>; or, you're willing to spend even <em>more</em> to get the newer fifth-generation health sensors, flashlight, mic/ speaker, and other perks available with a Forerunner 970 or Fenix 8.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oR7XWWutB7dhRjtyTZx3uG" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-training-effect.jpeg" alt="A post-run screen showing aerobic and anaerobic training effect on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oR7XWWutB7dhRjtyTZx3uG.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-vs-265">Forerunner 965 vs. 265</a> guide will break down the specific differences between the two, if you're feeling tempted to spend even less. When it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a>, you'll find plenty of options that can help you hit a PR, even without a deal; buying the Forerunner 965 is about letting yourself splurge on a watch that'll last you for years of training and give you insights you won't find anywhere else.</p><p>I do love my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, primarily for its twice-as-bright AMOLED display and new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-970-running-tolerance-tool-too-useful-to-be-premium-feature">running tolerance</a> metric that judges how many miles per week your body can handle. But since Garmin hasn't discounted it and isn't likely to do so until 2026, the Forerunner 965 is the best premium running watch that won't break the bank.</p><p>The other "premium" Garmin watch that's relatively affordable is the Epix Pro (Gen 2) 42mm at $449, with the modern perks and steel body that the 965 lacks. But its display is 1.2 inches instead of 1.4, it only hits 10 days of battery life instead of 23, and it's slightly more uncomfortable; the bigger models last longer, but they also cost more and weigh <em>significantly</em> more. And I think a lot of Garmin fans will prefer comfortable workouts to steel style.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to Google, you can expect at least 24 hours of battery life in regular use, and up to 84 hours when using Extreme Battery Saver. </p></article></section><h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-battery-life-2">What you need to know about the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold battery life</h2><p>As is the case with most phones, the actual length of time that your phone's battery will last is dependent on how you use it. So if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold resides on your desk or in a bag for most of the day, even with notifications left enabled, the phone will easily last for a day or two. On the flip side, if you have an affinity for using Google's latest foldable for everything from gaming to catching up on your favorite show, expect that number to drop pretty dramatically.</p><p>Of course, there are also other variables at play here, such as the apps that you use on a daily basis, in addition to things like whether the phone's connected to Wi-Fi all day, or if you're running beta software. However, it's also worth pointing out that no matter what you do, you'll likely experience somewhat poor battery life for the first week or two. This is because your phone is learning how you use it in order to provide tailored optimizations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VCf2vReryTS9cFi53N6EUD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-impressions-6" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold on Pixelsnap charger with screen open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VCf2vReryTS9cFi53N6EUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for "real world" results, we tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> for our review, resulting in some rather obvious findings. For one, the battery drained at a rate of about 15% per hour when using the inner display, which dropped to just below 10% per hour when only using the Cover Screen.</p><p>Extrapolating out the results of the test, we found that the 10 Pro Fold would last for "about 8 hours with only the inner display, or a little more than 11 with the cover screen." While these aren't the most impressive results, it's still quite a bit better than what you would find when comparing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's battery life to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p><p>But what about when the juice runs out, or you're getting low, and you need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-charging-speed">recharge the Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>? Thankfully, Google upgraded the charging experience, as the Pixel 10 Pro Fold supports up to 39W fast wired charging. As such, Google claims the phone will gain about 50% in 30 minutes "when using a 30W USB-C charger." However, this number can be improved even further, if you use Google's 45W charger.</p><p>The good news doesn't stop there, as wireless charging has also been greatly improved on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This is thanks, at least in part, to the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 support</a>, which doubles the wireless charging rate from 7.5W to 15W.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b320027c-2c1e-4b8c-bf0f-1c6cb18344de">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The most durable foldable</strong></em></p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't change much in the way of design compared to its predecessor, but it's packed with a larger battery, improved hinge, and is the first foldable to feature an IP68 rating.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It's available in the Gemini app starting today, powering a new app interface that is AI-generated in real-time to create custom UI elements. The app also adds the Gemini Agent, an experimental tool that can handle multi-step tasks for you without leaving the Gemini app.</p><p>It's the evolution of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>, a research prototype Chrome extension that tested using an AI agent to browse on a user's behalf. Everything Google learned from Project Mariner, plus Gemini 3 smarts, was used to create the Gemini Agent. The feature taps into Google Workspace apps and tools like Deep Research and Canvas to take care of complex requests. Paired with live web browsing support, the Gemini Agent is Google's "next step toward a true generalist agent."</p><p>Google provides a few examples of how you might use the Gemini Agent, like to manage Calendar events, create reminders, or organize your Gmail inbox. Although the Gemini Agent can complete actions on your behalf, it'll ask you for confirmation before making important changes, like completing a purchase or deleting an email.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RjrnCRfD7QEu4J3NYnZSs5" name="Gemini-Agent-1" alt="Gemini Agent in action in a Google demo video." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RjrnCRfD7QEu4J3NYnZSs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini 3 isn't just an agentic powerhouse, it's also great at vibe coding — the process of describing an interface or application to an AI agent that then codes it for the user.

Google says more Gemini 3 versions will be released "soon" as the company builds out its next-generation suite of AI models.</p><h2 id="gemini-3-reclaims-the-top-spot-on-the-lmarena-and-webdev-arena-leaderboards-2">Gemini 3 reclaims the top spot on the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ" name="gemini_3_lm_arena_leaderboard (1)" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Gemini 2.5 models</a>, released in March 2025, performed well on top AI benchmarks for months before losing ground to xAI and Anthropic models of late. Gemini 3 Pro flips that trend, as the AI model leads both the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards immediately following its launch. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, the new model significantly outperforms it on every major AI benchmark.</p><p>Notably, Gemini 3 Pro tops the LMArena leaderboard with a score of 1,501 points, dethroning Grok 4.1 Thinking, which earned a score of 1,483 points. For perspective, the Gemini 2.5 Pro model slotted in at third place with 1,452 points before Gemini 3 Pro's release. In other benchmarks, like Humanity's Last Exam, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5% without tool use — a result that demonstrates PhD-level reasoning, according to Google.</p><p>For the average user, Gemini 3 crucially "brings a new level of depth and nuance to every interaction." AI models tend to have a people-pleasing nature to them. They tell users what they want to hear, not what is actually true. Gemini 3 Pro responses are "smart, concise, and direct" by comparison, aiming to dispel the notion that AI models can't tell users what they need to hear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R" name="gemini_3_webdev_arena_leaderboard" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For website creation and generative user-interface design, Gemini 3 is "the best vibe coding and agentic coding model" Google says it has ever built.

The result is a Gemini 3 Pro model that can build playable 3D video games from scratch, create websites, or fulfill your vibe-coding needs.</p><p>For better performance, there's Gemini 3 Deep Think, improving results on Humanity's Last Exam to 41% without tool use.

The reason is that Cloudflare, a key internet infrastructure provider powering many of the biggest websites and platforms, has experienced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/cloudflare-is-down-crippling-x-chatgpt-and-more-in-widespread-outage">major outage</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare is one of the most reliable infrastructure providers, and its Content Delivery Network has long ensured that websites are replicated across multiple servers worldwide, providing fast loading times for users everywhere.</p><p>Yet, its central role in powering some of our favorite apps, websites, and services also makes it a key bottleneck when things go wrong, as it has this morning. Here’s what happened, the websites affected, and Cloudflare’s somewhat spotty history in the face of these exact attacks.</p><h2 id="why-were-so-many-websites-down-today-2">Why were so many websites down today?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1537px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.29%;"><img id="iJVzD6rCbefsAYKJYrgZyn" name="Cloudflare-outage-stats-november-18-downdetector" alt="Cloudflare outage stats for November 18 as displayed on Downdetector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iJVzD6rCbefsAYKJYrgZyn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1537" height="650" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cloudflare’s central role in powering the internet was thrust into the limelight around 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time this morning, November 18, as much of the internet suddenly stopped working.</p><p>I first noticed this issue on the social media site X (you may remember it as Twitter), and quickly realized it was a large outage when websites like Downdetector and several small blogs, which also rely on Cloudflare, demonstrated that this affected all websites, large and small — all stopped working.</p><p>It quickly became apparent that Cloudflare was having a major problem, and the company confirmed a global issue with widespread 500 errors. In web development parlance, this means an Internal Server Error, or a failure of the web server to fulfill a request. It’s generic by design, which also makes it challenging to fix, and outages lasted longer than a couple of hours this morning.</p><h2 id="cloudflare-has-taken-down-the-internet-before-2">Cloudflare has taken down the internet before</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.43%;"><img id="Y8mVN3ddJRKV7NwiLUQ5M9" name="x-twitter-outage-stats-november-18-downdetector" alt="X (Twitter) outage stats for November 18 as displayed on Downdetector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8mVN3ddJRKV7NwiLUQ5M9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1546" height="656" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the time of writing — 9:15 am Eastern Time — there’s little information about the root cause behind these issues.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-aisuru-botnet-used-500-000-ips-in-15-tbps-azure-ddos-attack/"><u>Bleeping Computer</u></a> suggests that this could be related to a 15 Tbps DDoS attack on Microsoft Azure; in other words, 500,000 IP addresses flooded Cloudflare in a targeted attack to bring down the platform, and much of the internet with it. However, it’s worth noting that, at the time of writing, Bleeping Computer is offline due to the Cloudflare outage, although platforms like X, Downdetector, and ChatGPT have all returned.</p><p>It’s not the first time that this has happened to Cloudflare, with notable outages dating back several years to 2019. Past outages have included major services like Amazon, Google, and Facebook for a few hours in 2019, an outage that affected even more sites than today's in 2023, and the current large outage that also impacted popular platforms such as Spotify, Canva, and League of Legends.</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-your-favorite-websites-2">What this means for your favorite websites</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify icon on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4072" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are several ways you’ll see this manifest itself throughout today, with some more obvious than others. First, many websites will display a splash screen and not load at all, as seen in the Bleeping Computer splash screen above.</p><p>However, Cloudflare provides more than just simple Content Delivery Networks and offers additional products, such as checkbox and captcha services, to prevent bot-like behavior. As I’ve seen today, Cloudflare’s checkbox feature is active on many websites, meaning sign-ins would have failed because the checkbox or captcha couldn't load.</p><p>Lastly, even as Cloudflare returns to full service, some websites may still have unresolved issues. Although it should clear itself automatically eventually, some websites — especially those updated less frequently — may have extended caching schedules that could affect when all services begin working.</p><h2 id="this-outage-highlights-a-key-flaw-in-the-internet-2">This outage highlights a key flaw in the internet</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1530px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.42%;"><img id="vfEp8Z5AY4vj5LvuZBLRQ5" name="OpenAI-outage-stats-november-18-downdetector" alt="Open AI & ChatGPT outage stats for November 18 as displayed on Downdetector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfEp8Z5AY4vj5LvuZBLRQ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1530" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We all know the internet isn’t perfect, but today’s outage follows a recent one for Amazon Web Services, which has proven that far too much of the internet relies on just a few key infrastructure providers. As such, an outage like today's can quickly affect a large number of internet users in both expected and unexpected ways.</p><p>Cloudflare provides a layer between the user and the server to cache website content, but it requires routing your traffic through their servers. Outages like today show a key flaw in this plan, especially as Cloudflare’s own reporting tools — including its Service Status page — haven’t been updated and show no reported problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1552px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.33%;"><img id="yicRCt6J5VbQNeR8v6ggKC" name="spotify-outage-stats-november-18-downdetector" alt="Spotify outage stats for November 18 as displayed on Downdetector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yicRCt6J5VbQNeR8v6ggKC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1552" height="657" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been developing websites for over 20 years, and Cloudflare is undoubtedly a key infrastructure provider on the internet.

You’d meticulously list out your to-dos in Tasks, only to have your Calendar show a deceptively "open" day. That frustrating disconnect is officially over, thanks to Calendar's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/11/block-time-for-tasks-google-calendar.html" target="_blank">latest update</a>.</p><p>The new feature does not just enable you to set a deadline for a task and hope you remember to do it later. You can now pick any open slot in your calendar, tap “Task,” fill in the details, and assign how long you want to work on it.</p><h2 id="protect-your-productivity-2">Protect your productivity</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1237px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.35%;"><img id="uhmeRPjych2BQkkphyMeNo" name="time-blocking-for-tasks-on-google-calendar" alt="blocking off time for tasks on Google Calendar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uhmeRPjych2BQkkphyMeNo.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1237" height="796" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Calendar has also added options to control visibility, turn on Do Not Disturb, and automatically decline meetings during that window so no one can hijack your productivity time. If you’ve ever scheduled a bogus meeting with yourself just to prevent someone from grabbing that time, this feature finally replaces that workaround.</p><p>Unlike before, the task doesn’t vanish into an event, either. This time, it stays in your Tasks list and reminders still fire, while you get all the structure of Calendar without losing the simplicity of the Tasks app.</p><p>This update rolled out starting November 6 for Rapid Release domains, with a slower release beginning December 1 for everyone else. It’s available to all Google Workspace tiers, Workspace Individual subscribers, and regular Gmail accounts.</p><p>There are a few limitations, though. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-rolls-out-its-long-overdue-deadline-feature-but-its-still-half-baked">Tasks now supports adding a due date</a>, it does not allow you to set a precise time, which feels slightly out of place given the new scheduling flexibility.</p><p>That said, if you're the kind of person who relies on “focus time” or third-party planners, this update is certainly an overdue fix rather than a game-changing upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The reason was Cloudflare, a company that supplies key network infrastructure for many websites. So when it chokes, the digital world stops breathing.</p><p>Visitors trying to load everything from X to the film reviewing site Letterboxd were greeted with the universally dreaded "internal server error on Cloudflare's network."</p><p>Cloudflare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that this was a global issue with “widespread 500 errors.” To make matters worse, the company’s own reporting tools and API also stopped working, so the team trying to fix the problem lost access to their usual resources.</p><p>The casualties roster was huge, proving just how deeply Cloudflare is embedded in our daily lives. Not only did social platforms go down, but AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT also stopped working. Creative professionals could not use Canva, and popular online games such as League of Legends were also offline.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:846px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.24%;"><img id="SyXkDxhHjDCyz7vzSMxFU5" name="Downdetector-down" alt="downdetector website is down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXkDxhHjDCyz7vzSMxFU5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="846" height="332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Downdetector)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most ironic parts of this outage was that services meant to track internet problems, such as Downdetector, were also affected.

Google's in-house weather forecasting contributes to Search, Gemini, Maps, and of course, the Pixel Weather app. The company spent the past few years using emerging AI technologies to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">being quicker and more efficient</a>. Now, it has a new WeatherNext 2 forecasting model that already powers weather data in multiple Google apps and services, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Google is calling it the company's "most advanced and efficient forecasting model." It's now eight-times faster at generating weather forecasts and has a resolution time of up to one hour. Like the WeatherNext 1 model it replaces, WeatherNext 2 generates four six-hour weather forecasts daily, with lead times of up to 15 days for future predictions.</p><p>While WeatherNext 1 models are remaining available for reference and research purposes, WeatherNext 2 is the future for Google weather forecasting. It surpasses the original on 99.9% of variables, according to Google, including temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitation, humidity, and pressure.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQwqoEm_xis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>WeatherNext 2 can quickly and efficiently predict weather scenarios from a single starting point, Google says.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S26 series is waging a war on weight and bulk, aiming to land a decisive body blow against the iPhone 17 line. A fresh leak from the notoriously accurate tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1989972214662508687" target="_blank">@UniverseIce on X</a> reveals the S26 lineup is universally lighter and slimmer than its direct Apple competition.</p><p>According to the leak, the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> is said to weigh 164g and measure roughly 6.9mm thick. The S26 Plus is around 191g and 7.3mm thick. The S26 Ultra reportedly weighs about 214g and is 7.9mm thick.</p><p>For comparison, the iPhone 17 weighs about 177g and measures 7.95mm thick for the base model, while the Pro Max version weighs roughly 231g and measures 8.75 mm. So if the leaks are correct, Samsung is pushing for lighter and thinner flagships across the S26 series.</p><p>For consumers, putting less heft in your hand can translate into better feel and ergonomics, especially in this flagship era when phones are getting bigger and heavier.</p><h2 id="the-base-model-is-the-new-featherweight-2">The base model is the new featherweight</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.46%;"><img id="88SAGVspJYdh3jfubbqVnT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-weight-specs" alt="weight comparison of the Galaxy S26 lineup versus the iPhone 17" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88SAGVspJYdh3jfubbqVnT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2240" height="1444" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base S26, if its supposed weight and thickness are accurate, would be lighter and thinner than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android phones</a> right now, especially compared to the iPhone or even the previous Galaxy S25 lineup. At 164g, it's only 1 gram heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>The Plus model sits in the middle ground, and the S26 Ultra still feels premium but is noticeably slimmer/lighter than the previous S25 Ultra (which weighed around 218g and measured about 8.2mm).</p><p>However, the weights and thicknesses are not official — they come from a chart shared by tipsters. Changes could happen. For example, Android Headlines previously reported that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-prototype-reportedly-keeps-qi2-magnets-at-the-expense-of-thickness">base S26 would be 7.24mm thick</a>, and thus, Samsung may have made tweaks.</p><p>The big question is what Samsung may have given up to achieve this slim design. Usually, making a phone thinner can affect battery life and camera size. A lighter or thinner phone might mean trade-offs in battery capacity, cooling, or camera modules. Hopefully, these changes will not lead to a smaller battery or fewer features in Samsung's next flagship phones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OnePlus somehow managed to sabotage its own product, and outside of a big battery, there isn't much going on with the device.</p><p>That's why I think you should get the Find X9 instead. I used the Find X9 alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and the smaller phone is fantastic. In fact, other than a few changes to the camera system, the phone is nearly identical to the Find X9 Pro, and it gets Hasselblad tuning. You may think I'm overestimating the importance of Hasselblad, but it genuinely makes a difference, and I like the color tuning this generation.</p><p>Best of all, the Find X9 just made its debut in India, with the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/oppo-find-x9-titanium-grey-256-gb/p/itma96fe4cab1395?pid=MOBHGZZ8SAMGGJHR">available for ₹74,999</a> ($846). That's ₹2,000 higher than what you pay for the OnePlus 15 in India — ₹72,999 ($824) — but you're getting a better phone, and OPPO has quite the list of incentives this time, including a 180-day defect guarantee. Should you notice any hardware issues with your phone within six months, you'll get a new phone — no questions asked.</p><p>The Find X9 has a smaller 6.59-inch panel, and you get a better in-hand feel. The design isn't distinctive, but it looks good enough, and I like it better than the OnePlus 15. You also get IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, and Gorilla Glass 7i on the front glass.</p><p>Although the 7,050mAh battery is a little smaller, I still got a day and a half between charges, and it has 80W as standard. The MediaTek Dimensity 9500 is able to hold its own against Qualcomm, and if anything, it doesn't tend to overheat during extended gaming sessions, so you're coming out ahead.</p><p>The cameras are where you'll notice the biggest difference; the Find X9 gets a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, 50MP 3x zoom lens, and 50MP wide-angle module. It consistently takes better photos than the OnePlus 15, and the new Lumo imaging engine does a terrific job in low-light scenarios.</p><p>Having used both devices, I can say with some confidence that the Find X9 is the better choice, and I'm excited to see the phone go on sale in India.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The result is that the OnePlus 15 doesn't look like any other OnePlus phone, and the cameras aren't as good as last year. You miss out on all the Hasselblad extras as well. The AMOLED panel may not be as high a resolution, but it absolutely doesn't make a difference in daily use. The only thing the OnePlus 15 gets right is battery life; thanks to a much bigger 7,300mAh battery, the phone lasts up to two days. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Huge battery lasts two days with medium use</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Great internals</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Good AMOLED panel</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Design doesn't stand out as much as last year</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>I don't like the cameras</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Misses out on Hasselblad integration</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_versus" data-id="8cd32872-73ca-4e8c-ae34-719e4c9ab375">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ts9g2aqxd2fdnYNz9WHKVU.jpg' alt="OnePlus 13 in Midnight Ocean cropped square product render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 13</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still the best all-rounder</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 13 is what I'd buy right now; the phone has a better design, great cameras with Hasselblad tuning, powerful internals that show no signs of slowing down, and reliable battery life.

It's just a generic slab of a phone, and I don't get how we got this design to follow the OnePlus 13.

Yes, the button has better configurability, but I don't want that — I need a way to reliably change between ring and vibrate modes, and a toggle was the ideal way to do that.</p><p>Anyway, both phones get IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, and the OnePlus 15 switches to an ultrasonic in-screen module.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-panel-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13: Panel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4MLxRGBvKkhpPutfdiaYxg" name="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4MLxRGBvKkhpPutfdiaYxg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5139" height="2895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot has been said about how the AMOLED panel on the OnePlus 15 is a downgrade because of the lower 1.5K resolution.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-used-a-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-powered-gaming-phone-and-im-convinced-qualcomm-has-the-fastest-mobile-chipset-theres-just-one-glaring-issue">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> runs even hotter than the Snapdragon 8 Elite in my testing, and the only way to control the thermals is to throttle the chipset aggressively, which the OnePlus 15 does.</p><p>It gets noticeably hotter as well, exceeding 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) in my testing, and there's plenty of throttling during extended gaming sessions. The heat extends to the back and even the mid-frame, making it uncomfortable to hold the device reliably. So while you get better framerates in select titles, there's also a greater potential to overheat.</p><p>And although the OnePlus 13 launched a year ago, I don't see any issues with the hardware at all — it holds up just as well. It also tends to overheat, but it isn't quite as extreme as the OnePlus 15, and it handles demanding games with ease.</p><p>The only category where the OnePlus 15 has a definite edge is the battery life. Thanks to a massive 7,300mAh battery, the phone manages to last up to two days on a full charge — the only other device that did a better job was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>.

That isn't the case with the OnePlus 15; the phone has a trio of 50MP cameras, but they have smaller sensors than the OnePlus 13, and that just doesn't make sense to me.</p><p>What's just as annoying is that the OnePlus 15 misses out on Hasselblad tuning. This is something that I enjoy using on OnePlus phones, and while I get devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> not having it, but for the OnePlus 15 to also miss out is just an egregious omission.

Unlike Samsung's phones, you don't get any new software features on the OnePlus 15, and the UI itself is nearly identical to that of iOS 26.</p><p>I don't get why the interface isn't called ColorOS, because it is identical to what you see on the Find X9 and X9 Pro — the only difference is the name. The UI has good fluidity, and I like the new design, even if there isn't much in the way of originality left. Nothing much has changed when it comes to software updates either, with both phones slated to get four Android OS updates and six years of security updates.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="V7FBwaqmWGWepL22qMp96h" name="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V7FBwaqmWGWepL22qMp96h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll make this easy: if you live in North America, you should get the OnePlus 15. There's a clear shortage of good phones in the region, with just the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 serving as viable alternatives to the OnePlus 15.</p><p>There's also the fact that the OnePlus 13 costs the same as the OnePlus 15 in the U.S., so you're not really shelling out anything extra to get the newer phone. I'd still consider waiting to see if the OnePlus 13 goes on sale, because in that scenario, it is a better phone. Other than that, the OnePlus 15 is what I'd suggest.</p><p>In every other country, the OnePlus 13 continues to be the better choice; it doesn't cost as much, while still delivering a better camera system, sleeker design that's great to hold, and terrific internals. If anything, the only thing you're missing out by not getting the OnePlus 15 is the battery life, but it isn't like the OnePlus 13 is a slouch in this regard — my unit still manages to last a day and a half.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="30774343-a52c-427b-bc18-62ad9153bc06">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Battery beast</strong></em></p><p>It should be clear by now that I don't like the phone.

On the bright side, buying a phone through your wireless provider could get you an extremely cheap (or even free) device if you play your cards right. Just be sure to read through the fine print before you commit.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-best-time-of-year-to-buy-a-new-phone-2">What's the best time of year to buy a new phone?</h2><p>The best time to buy a new phone would be around the holidays or during major sale events, such as Amazon Prime Day. It's also a good idea to look for preorder deals when a new phone is first announced, particularly if you're looking for a trade-in opportunity or a discount through your wireless carrier. As a general rule of thumb, keep an eye out for major sale events around Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and back-to-school season, alongside holidays like the 4th of July and Memorial Day in the United States.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The big sale event will be followed by Cyber Monday on December 1st, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to save big on Android tech.</p><h2 id="what-meta-quest-deals-can-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Meta Quest deals can I expect during Black Friday?</h2><p>As you can see from the deals above, the Meta Quest 3S is already getting discounted for Black Friday. Quest accessories are also seeing a ton of early discounts, and while the Quest 3 hasn't received its price drop yet, I'm sure we'll witness some money-saving opportunities as we approach the big day. Needless to say, I'll be updating this guide with new deals as they go live.</p><h2 id="should-i-buy-a-meta-quest-now-or-wait-for-black-friday-2">Should I buy a Meta Quest now or wait for Black Friday?</h2><p>If you're interested in buying the Meta Quest 3S, I'd say with a good degree of certainty that you can already take advantage of the deals above without worrying about FOMO. It's quite unlikely that the price will drop any further on the affordable VR headset.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>if you're interested in buying the regular Quest 3 this holiday season, I'd wait to see if any other deals go live.</strong> After all, the headset is already selling at full price, so you have nothing to lose if Black Friday disappoints us.</p><h2 id="which-meta-quest-headset-is-best-for-beginners-2">Which Meta Quest headset is best for beginners?</h2><p>If you're new to VR gaming, the Meta Quest 3S is a dream come true. Typically priced around $200-$300, the approachable headset boasts nearly all the same specs as the standard Quest 3, including the powerful XR2 Gen 2 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and a crystal-clear display, and it's arguably even more powerful than its more-expensive counterpart. You even get access to all the same games. Sure, we could discuss the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs Meta Quest 3</a> debate all day, but if you're buying your first-ever VR headset, I would strongly recommend saving some money and going with the Quest 3S this Black Friday.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem — prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out.</p><p>To me, Meta makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses.</p><h2 id="ordering-custom-meta-lenses-2">Ordering custom Meta lenses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HuXmSyJwTfuvPV96VUXYRn" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-1" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HuXmSyJwTfuvPV96VUXYRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">the Oakley Meta HSTN</a> didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses.</p><p>I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">After months of research</a>, I placed my first order with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lensology.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lensology</a>, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in "click and fit" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the "Warm Gray" colorway.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2Zas8zbnU7PjBUQAsecyfc" name="Wearing-HSTN-Lensology-Lenses" alt="Wearing the Oakley Meta HSTN with custom Amber transition lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Zas8zbnU7PjBUQAsecyfc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them.</p><p>I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-7" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> and stumbled upon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.svedoptical.com" target="_blank">SVED Optical</a>. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard.</p><p>The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable.</p><p>SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses.</p><h2 id="installation-and-fit-2">Installation and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NB5AsiHxmhNaACVhMApgan" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-4" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NB5AsiHxmhNaACVhMApgan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days.</p><p>When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame.</p><p>I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JxqCn7aKAtepvc78Pu85Mn" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-2" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JxqCn7aKAtepvc78Pu85Mn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf4YWcqGmEw">instructional video on YouTube</a>, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames.</p><p>If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push <em>really</em> hard — you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process.</p><h2 id="absolutely-worth-it-2">Absolutely worth it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AhtXwtC6ELZw437soQ7Aym" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-6" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhtXwtC6ELZw437soQ7Aym.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk.</p><p>I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go.</p><p>Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-meta-smart-glasses-should-you-buy">Meta glasses are a game-changer</a>, and everyone should get to experience them.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d9611a29-7efc-4fda-b9ec-0f50259f5958">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AWVUakHn9pGv2BoZuVrfdB.jpg' alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with black frames and Road PRIZM lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta Vanguard</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best AI glasses</strong></em></p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera.

Essentially, it's a Nintendo Switch that you wear. You can cast your feed to any TV, smartphone, or tablet so everyone in the room can see what you're doing, and it doesn't need another console, PC, or wires to work. You download games from the Meta Horizon store directly onto the headset and everything runs on the headset.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S is a more affordable version of the Meta Quest 3, offering the same powerful processing power as that more expensive headset and giving you full access to Quest 3-exclusive VR and mixed reality games. It features full-color passthrough vision, so you see the room around you even when wearing the headset, helping to avoid the "isolating" feel some VR headsets have.</p><p><strong>Why do you need it:</strong></p><p>This particular deal is the lowest price we've <strong>ever</strong> seen for the Meta Quest 3S, a full $50 less than the next-best price. Not only that, but Costco's inclusion of one year of Meta Horizon Plus — normally $60 a year — means you get full access to nearly 30 games from the moment you power the headset on for the first time. Plus, since that catalog of games swaps out regularly, you'll always have something new to play without having to spend any money for the next <em>year</em>.</p><p><strong>Why it's better than other products:</strong></p><p>The Meta Quest 3S offers unique types of games when compared to traditional consoles like a Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox. While there are plenty of AAA games that core gamers will enjoy — Batman Arkham Shadow, Metro Awakening, the Arizona Sunshine series, and Assassin's Creed Nexus VR are a few examples — lots of fresh new brands have cropped up that help definine the VR experience in unique ways.</p><p>Since this is a portable gaming console, you don't need anything else to play games on it. Just charge the battery up like a smartphone, pop it on your head, and enjoy impressively immersive games that'll get your body moving in new ways.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Global tablet shipments have grown by an estimated 5.1%, with Lenovo seeing the most growth at 23%, followed by Huawei (11.5%), and "Others" (9.6%).</p><p>Apple and Samsung remain at the top of the leaderboards when it comes to overall market share.

As for why this trend has been continuing, it's really a multitude of reasons.</p><p>In the report, Himani Mukka, Omdia Research Manager says: "<em>Consumer demand has been driven by factors such as frequent new product launches, government subsidies, increased appetite for kids’ and gaming tablets, competitive pricing, promotional campaigns, and seasonal back-to-school buying, which varies across regions depending on academic calendars.</em>"</p><p>It's surprising to see that there hasn't been a singular driving force behind the continued growth in tablets. However, the same can't be said for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, which saw an increase in global shipments by 3.1%.</p><p>Of the companies listed in the report, only Lenovo and ASUS shipped more units over the course of the past year. Acer saw the steepest drop, with its annual growth down almost 35% and more than a 10% drop in market share, with Dell (-23%) and HP (-15.3%) also seeing substantial losses over the same time frame.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1519px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.03%;"><img id="qY8HPYp5M4YhyegvxftrRa" name="worldwide-chromebook-shipments-q3-2025-omdia" alt="Worldwide Chromebook shipments for Q3 2025 according to Omdia" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qY8HPYp5M4YhyegvxftrRa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1519" height="1079" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Omdia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike tablets, there is one major reason why Chromebooks saw a rise in popularity, and it's because of Japan's GIGA 2.0 initiative. This project aims to ensure that every student in "compulsory education" is provided with a tablet or computer, and what better way to do so than with a Chromebook.</p><p>This came at the right time for the Chromebook market, as there was an almost 25% drop in global market share in North America. However, this could quickly change according to Kieren Jessop, Research Manager at Omdia, as they "expect education funding in the US to increasingly come from state or local rather than federal sources, which could provide a steady boost to Chromebook shipments in the region."</p><p>It will be interesting to see how these numbers look this time next year.

It's a telescopic controller that turns your phone into a gaming powerhouse and much more.

The entire thing is translucent green and themed to match the original Halo Special Edition Xbox. It's uniquely Xbox in a way we haven't seen from the brand in recent years. By comparison, the black and white colorways of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are uninspiring.</p><p>If you want to relive Xbox's golden age, you can do so with the Backbone Pro Xbox Edition. It sports full-size ALPS thumbsticks, laser-etched textured grips, and crucially, Hall Effect triggers. That's a major durability win, as it ensures the Backbone Pro will remain sharp and accurate even after years of gameplay. Beyond that, there are rear buttons and an Xbox button that jumps you into the Xbox app on Android.</p><p>The mobile game controller can do a lot more than just power your Android gameplay. It supports a feature called FlowState in the Backbone app that enables automatic device switching. A single button press can move your Backbone Pro Xbox Edition between your Android phone, PC, and TV.</p><h2 id="turn-your-android-phone-into-an-xbox-2">Turn your Android phone into an Xbox</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-10" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4636" height="2608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Backbone Pro on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is more than just a console brand in 2025. Almost anything that can run Xbox Game Pass and utilize Xbox Cloud Gaming is now an Xbox, and that includes your Android phone. With the Backbone Pro Xbox Edition, your phone can look the part, too. It includes a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>Aside from the clever color, Backbone Pro Xbox Edition has neat tech inside, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> support for long battery life.

It's widely available on version 16.45 of the Gemini app for Android, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/14/gemini-android-homepage-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, but the changes haven't made their way to the iOS app or web client yet. Android Central confirmed the new appearance and user-interface is available in the Gemini app on its devices following a server-side push.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> homepage now features a bluish-gray background on light mode, and a fully-black background on dark mode. There's still a greeting, but it reads "Hi" rather than "Hello." Additionally, the greeting asks "Where should we start" below it, and appears in white or black font (for dark and light mode) instead of blue. Gemini's suggestions are now arranged in a left-aligned list.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV" name="Gemini-App-Redesign-Nov-2025" alt="The various Gemini app screens tweaked in a Nov 2025 redesign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The chat interface also receives a minor refresh, with a new conversation button taking the place of the old Google account switcher. Users can still change their Google account in other places in the Gemini app, like the homepage, side menu, or in the My Stuff page.</p><p>You can also access the Pin, Rename, or Delete buttons straight from the conversation UI by tapping the chat name. This will reveal a dropdown menu with the three buttons. Previously, they were included in the side menu.</p><h2 id="the-gemini-app-now-offers-a-my-stuff-section-for-user-content-2">The Gemini app now offers a 'My Stuff' section for user content</h2><p>The hamburger menu adds a "My Stuff" section alongside the existing "Gems" and "Chats" collections. My Stuff stores images, videos, and Canvas creations separate of your Gemini chats for easy access. By tapping content in My Stuff, you'll be transported into the Gemini conversation used to generate the image, video, or Canvas with AI.</p><p>Google seems to be prioritizing content generation in the Gemini app with recent updates. It can create photos and videos using the Imagen and Veo models in the Gemini app, and these capabilities are suggested uses on the Gemini homepage. More recently, the company added "Ingredients to Video" support in the Gemini app, which allows users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos">generate videos from reference images</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>YouTube Music users have long been frustrated by the lack of an option to search within a playlist, but the platform looks to be introducing a feature that finally fixes that shortcoming.</p><p>As per a user post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1oyh5n7/no_way_playlist_search_is_finally_here/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, and first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-playlist-search-3616240/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, version 8.45.3 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> on iOS includes a new "Find in playlist" option within the overflow menu. The user claims to be located in India.</p><p>Essentially, you’ll be able to open a playlist, tap the three-dot menu, and then type to locate songs inside large playlists using the new option. Until now, if you had hundreds of tracks in a playlist, you’d just have to scroll or hope you remembered roughly where the song was. This update addresses that pain point.</p><h2 id="android-left-out-for-now-2">Android left out (for now)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.39%;"><img id="qPPhMhQwcHXR9K6G59cDqK" name="Youtube-music-playlist-search-option" alt="Find in playlist option in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPPhMhQwcHXR9K6G59cDqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xerus9915 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However — and this is a big caveat— it’s not yet widely available, according to comments on the Reddit post. Android users in particular seem left out for now. It is, therefore, safe to assume that this is part of an A/B test.</p><p>For power users who maintain big playlists, this is a big usability win. The update moves YouTube Music closer to feature parity with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">leading music streaming apps</a> like Spotify by tackling a long-standing complaint. On Spotify, you can swipe down on any playlist screen to reveal the "Find in playlist" search bar at the top.</p><p>The absence of the same feature on YouTube Music until now had been a frequent gripe, so it's nice to see Google finally paying attention to user feedback — this kind of quality-of-life improvement matters.</p><p>The rollout appears to be extremely limited. Even among those who have the same app version (8.45.3), many still don’t see the feature. It seems sneakily enabled for selected accounts, which means you could update and still not get it yet.</p><p>Some functionality may still be missing: for example, the reports say radios saved in the Library may not support the search feature yet.</p><p>While the search feature is not fully out yet, it’s a meaningful step forward nonetheless. For now, you might have to sit tight and wait for your account to get the option. When it finally hits your region and your device, your playlist-browsing life will feel a little smoother.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When you’re in the task details screen, you’ll find a new “Add deadline” field above the usual date/time slot.</p><p>However, you can’t set a specific time for your deadline, as Android Police founder Artem Russakovskii notes. So, even with this change, the rollout feels like a half-step toward full task-management capability. Additionally, the deadline date does not appear on the main task list, making it tough to spot which tasks are actually on the clock.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Tasks now supports deadlines.But for some reason you can only set the date, not time.

Even so, this is a significant change for an app that’s mostly been seen as a basic checklist rather than a full task manager.</p><p>For users who need to assign a date to a task, the new deadline feature is straightforward: open, edit, select a date, and save. However, for those managing larger projects, the app still lacks precise scheduling, priority settings, subtasks, and an overview of all deadlines. So while it’s a win for simple planning, it still leaves power users wanting more.</p><p>Nevertheless, this update shows Google finally listening to users who want more than a basic checklist app. Turning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tasks">Google Tasks</a> into something that understands deadlines instantly makes it more useful and nudges it closer to a real task manager instead of just a place to jot down lists. It’s a smart move, too — Google is adding features that actually matter without blowing up the app or redesigning everything just for the sake of change.</p><p>If Tasks is your go-to app for staying organized, this upgrade is a breath of fresh air. But if you're looking for full-featured task management with hour-based deadlines and detailed tracking, you’ll need to look elsewhere.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When you tap this chip, the Play Store apparently displays screenshots, reviews, and details specific to the immersive format, giving you a preview of exactly how an app behaves when you strap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">headset</a>.</p><p>This update also extends to the browsing experience: under both the Apps and Games tabs, the “Other devices” filter now includes a dedicated XR headset section, making it easier to discover apps designed for mixed reality and VR environments.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.70%;"><img id="xKsPBkqV3mMnoVU49gHXiC" name="XR-headset-section-Play-Store" alt="XR headset section in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xKsPBkqV3mMnoVU49gHXiC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="396" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.94%;"><img id="sQM4F2zzUy8cJqcEKehZiC" name="XR-headset-section-Play-Store" alt="XR headset section in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sQM4F2zzUy8cJqcEKehZiC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="392" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This change comes at the right time, as Android is moving into XR hardware. Google and Samsung’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR headset</a> is a key part of that push, and Google is trying to avoid a situation where the hardware launches before the content ecosystem is ready. With Google organizing the Play Store around XR, consumers won’t have to hunt for compatible apps one by one.</p><h2 id="ecosystem-expansion-2">Ecosystem expansion</h2><p>Google's ambitions stretch well past a single partner. Google’s clearly making sure Android apps work smoothly across the wider XR landscape. You can see that in platforms like Valve’s Steam Frame VR, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">which is expected to run Android apps</a> and is speeding up XR content support with its own developer kit program. So, improving the Play Store’s XR features now helps Android stay important as more companies join the mixed-reality market.</p><p>From the user's perspective, this simplifies everything. If you’re considering buying an Android-powered headset, or already planning to pick up the Galaxy XR when it hits store shelves, the Play Store’s new layout makes it clear which apps are built for immersive use. The revamp gives you a cleaner preview experience, better context from other XR users, and an easier way to browse apps designed specifically for spatial environments.</p><p>For Google, this is a smart first step. Building the content structure early makes things easier for both developers and users later on, so Android will have a strong ecosystem ready before XR hardware becomes mainstream.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, Samsung could be opting for a flatter, more refined stem and a more minimal look for the Buds 4 Pro.</p><p>Additionally, we’re seeing that the icons in One UI 8.5 and leaked renders hint that the regular Buds 4 will adopt this new design language too.</p><p>The charging case might have a new shape as well.

Quite a few of Meta's products are set to be holiday favorites, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest headsets</a> to Ray-Ban and Oakley Meta smart glasses. Ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Meta sent a $100 off promotion code to existing customers, allowing them to save on "select Meta devices."</p><p>The emails went out on Thursday, Nov. 13, and seemed to be widespread. Multiple Meta device owners at Android Central received the promotion, only to find that the promo codes were "no longer valid" after clicking the Meta Store link in the email. A Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1owbhd5/anyone_else_get_this/" target="_blank">thread</a> on the Ray-Ban Meta subreddit with nearly 200 comments revealed the invalid promo codes were sent out to many Meta customers.</p><p>Complicating matters was the fact that some Meta customers were able to redeem the $100 off promo code successfully. The vast majority of recipients weren't able to use the code, though. As it turns out, Meta quietly explained what went wrong with the $100 off promotion in an update to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/legal/promotion-terms/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq1Ck-FG9ksr5g7EhSy3pJTaRLwXiPiK28qBKQw441KuSOpJc" target="_blank">promotion terms webpage</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1002px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:129.54%;"><img id="GXVXpNFEAamrpyJu2UBpDa" name="Meta-Discount-price-Error" alt="The erroneous Meta promo code sent out via email this week." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXVXpNFEAamrpyJu2UBpDa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1002" height="1298" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Near the bottom of the page, Meta addressed the situation in the <strong>Exclusive Temporary Price Drop </strong>section. "An email offering $100 off Meta.com was sent to certain users in error," the page explains. "Thank you for being a valued member of the Meta community."</p><p>The notice ends a few days of confusion regarding whether the email offers weren't working as the result of a bug, store error, or general mistake. In reality, it was a bit of both — the $100 off coupon is valid for some users, but was sent to many more users in error. The promotion originally slated to last through Dec. 31, 2025 was thus invalidated for the users who weren't supposed to receive discount codes.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1owbhd5/anyone_else_get_this">Anyone else get this?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta">r/RaybanMeta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Those who were eligible for the offer can save $100 when purchasing a Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 3S, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HTSN</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> using the code.

There are a few ways to save a few bucks on Meta smart glasses in the meantime. Meta is currently running a "Give 30, Get 30" promo where users can save $30 on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, Meta Quest hardware, and more by using a referral link. The person that referred you will also get $30 in credits to use for themselves at the Meta Store. This promo was sent out to existing Meta customers via email in November, and you can technically use it for yourself by making a purchase signed out or by using another account.</p><p>Another way to save big on Meta glasses is by purchasing them at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.backcountry.com/search?s=u&q=meta" target="_blank">Backcountry</a>. The retailer will give you 20% off any full-price item when you sign up for email/text communications, and shockingly, Ray-Ban and Oakley Meta glasses are included. For example, you can save $100 on brand-new Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses using the Backcountry offer.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The earlier compact waveform has been replaced by an arc that vibrates with speech.

While the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to have a very limited release outside of the brand's home market, it's slated to come to the U.S. Samsung seems to be making the necessary preparations to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold stateside, like firmware testing for U.S. models.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-trifold-usa-launch-firmware-testing/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports Samsung is currently testing firmware for another Galaxy Z TriFold model. Previously, it uncovered firmware testing for the carrier-locked variant of the Galaxy Z TriFold, which has a <strong>SM-F968U</strong> model number.</p><p>Now, the site reveals a new Galaxy Z TriFold model, <strong>SM-F968U1</strong>, is undergoing firmware testing as well. This is the unlocked Galaxy Z TriFold version that will be sold directly from Samsung and its retail partners. It all but confirms Samsung plans to sell the Galaxy Z TriFold in the U.S. both through retail channels and cellular carriers.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"> pic.twitter.com/MLRXg3a74U<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983022046738297275">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The report notes that it's a bit late in the expected release cycle for Samsung to begin testing firmware for a new phone model. Rumors point to the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold launching before the end of this year. The exact date floating around is Dec. 5, which is less than a month away. Despite the late testing, this is a sign the Galaxy Z TriFold is indeed nearing a U.S. release.</p><h2 id="what-else-do-we-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-2">What else do we know about the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-trifold-specs-details">recent leak</a> pulled the curtain on the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, confirming that will be the public name for the device (even though it only actually folds twice).

With it, users can provide Veo 3.1 reference images that will "control the characters, objects, and style."

The two devices launched with Android 15 in late 2024 and early 2025, respectively, and were some of the final major flagships still waiting to get an upgrade. Google released the Android 16 in June 2025, and said it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">spent time working with third-party OEMs</a> beforehand to help deliver future Android upgrades quickly.</p><p>After a five-month-long wait, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> users are starting to receive the Android 16 update. It comes with a version number of <strong>36.0810.1810.43</strong> for both phones, and each update should be around 1GB in size. The Asus ROG Phone 9 update includes more fixes and improvements, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zentalk.asus.com/t5/release-notes/251112-rog-phone-9-ww-36-0810-1810-43-android-16/ba-p/495184" target="_blank">release notes</a>, which makes sense considering it's the older device.</p><p>Asus warns users that some third-party apps aren't compatible with Android 16 yet, and recommends they back up their device before applying the update. It also explains the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> update is rolling out in batches, based on device serial number, so it might take a few days for all Asus ROG Phone 9 and Zenfone 12 Ultra users to receive it.</p><h2 id="asus-rog-phone-9-update-changelog-2">Asus ROG Phone 9 update changelog</h2><ul><li>Please back up your data before upgrading to Android 16.</li><li>Upgraded system to Android 16.</li><li>Adjusted the system navigation settings.

A new smart ring brand has entered the wearable space, and it’s not interested in your heart rate. Called the Stream Ring, this device, launched by a team of former Meta employees, is built for one primary purpose: capturing your voice notes and interacting with AI, instantly.</p><p>The folks behind this new wearable are Mina Fahmi, a former product manager at CTRL-labs, and Kirak Hong, a former technical lead manager at Facebook Reality Labs. The two founded Sandbar, and they're pitching the Stream Ring as a “mouse for voice” because it’s designed around voice capture and AI interaction rather than tracking your every heartbeat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/05/former-meta-employees-launch-stream-a-smart-ring-that-takes-voice-notes-and-controls-music/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> reports.</p><p>Fahmi and Hong recognized that while your phone is great, it’s not always fast enough to capture a fleeting thought.

Sandbar notes that the ring is not always eavesdropping, but always ready when you are.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:705px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.04%;"><img id="J8zqZmHQLcmdPvmH4uBGMD" name="Stream-smart-ring-all-colors" alt="silver and gold versions of the Stream ring stacked against each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8zqZmHQLcmdPvmH4uBGMD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="705" height="529" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sandbar)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Worn on your index finger on your dominant hand, Stream houses a mic and a touchpad on the flat surface.

While the industry is dominated by products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> and various fitness trackers that treat your finger like a vital-sign monitoring station, Stream consciously rejects that path. It has no heart rate monitor and zero intention of counting your steps or analyzing your deep sleep stages.</p><p>While others count your pulse and sleep phases, the Stream Ring listens when you want to talk and captures what matters in the moment. That distinction alone may appeal to a certain crowd: creators, professionals, folks tired of being tracked every second.</p><p>Set to start shipping next summer, the Stream Ring is betting that accessibility and singular focus on immediate utility will win over users tired of health-tracking features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

YouTube TV and Disney's prior carriage deal ended Oct. 30, 2025, and the sides began publicly advocating for a new agreement even before it expired.

Yes, the launch brought us the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> series, but Apple also introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-17-vs-google-pixel-10" target="_blank">iPhone 17</a>, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>No, it's not the excellent display, nor the fantastic battery life. And it's certainly not the dual camera, although it's arguably better than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> despite lacking a third camera. Rather, it's the 256GB starting storage, which is what makes the iPhone 17 likely the best phone for many people this year.</p><p>The biggest change with the storage is actually three-fold, and all are strong reasons that I hope Google and Samsung quickly follow suit and copy Apple. One of them is also the core reason the iPhone 17 is likely even better than the more expensive Pixel 10 Pro.

But will a wider field of view compensate for the lack of real advancements in front-facing imaging?</p><p>The latest rumored change is a larger front-facing camera cutout, possibly about 4mm wide, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987865298242818269" target="_blank">@UniverseIce on X</a>. If true, this would be the largest Infinity-O hole ever on a Samsung Ultra model, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-have-the-widest-infinity-o-camera-cutout-yet/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> points out.</p><p>As per the leaker, the change is supposedly meant to accommodate a wider field of view, increasing from about 80 degrees on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to roughly 85 degrees. In theory, that means you’ll be able to fit even more into your selfies or group shots without stretching your arm as far.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.91%;"><img id="TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-front-camera-cutout" alt="side by side comparison of the front camera cutout on the Galaxy S25 Ultra (right) and S26 Ultra (left)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="659" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the actual front camera hardware might not see any real upgrades. The resolution and sensor could stay the same as before, meaning you’ll get a wider frame but not necessarily a better image overall.</p><p>This change shows a curious change to Samsung’s design approach. For years, Samsung has made its punch-hole cameras smaller to create a more immersive display. Now, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might be moving in the opposite direction.</p><h2 id="rear-camera-tweaks-2">Rear camera tweaks</h2><p>For the rear cameras, Samsung seems to be making small improvements instead of big changes. The S26 Ultra is said to retain the same 200MP main camera and 50MP ultra-wide lens as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>The telephoto system might change a bit, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">3x telephoto lens</a> possibly using a new 12MP ISOCELL S5K3LD sensor instead of the older IMX754, as per the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1986626916661731732" target="_blank">tipster</a>. While this sounds like an upgrade, the new sensor is actually smaller at 1/3.94" compared to 1/3.52", which could slightly reduce how much light it captures.</p><p>The 5x periscope zoom could get a wider aperture, changing from f/3.4 to f/2.9, which should help with low-light photos. There are also rumors about a new APV video codec that might make videos more efficient and higher quality, but this is still unconfirmed.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987135260321325060" target="_blank">earlier rumor</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra may look slimmer and include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, but the larger Infinity-O cutout will likely be more noticeable. Samsung usually prefers symmetry and minimalism in its designs, so some people might see this larger punch-hole as a negative move.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the main rumored design change for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The main rumored change is a larger front-facing camera cutout (also known as an Infinity-O hole) on the display, which is expected to be around 4mm wide.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

This pivotal shift marks a long-awaited enhancement in Samsung’s charging capabilities since 2017.</p><p>Previous leaks have revealed that Samsung will finally give the top-tier Galaxy S26 Ultra a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">significant charging upgrade</a>, bumping the wired charging speed from 45W to 60W. While this still won't match the blazing speeds of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> or Chinese flagships like the Xiaomi 17 Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Oppo Find X9 Pro</a>, it's still a welcome improvement.

This would mark the first time in nearly six years that Samsung has upgraded wireless charging speeds, which would certainly be a welcome change.</p><p>It's not yet known whether the phones will support Qi2 charging speeds (which offer up to 25W maximum) or include a built-in magnetic ring similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. However, given Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">introduced its own MagSafe-style chargers</a>, it's likely we'll see both Qi2 magnets and faster charging supported.</p><p>Plenty has leaked about the Galaxy S26 series in recent weeks. The lineup was initially rumored for a February 2026 launch, but a recent leak suggests it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-series-might-arrive-jan-2025">arrive in late January instead</a>.

OnePlus skipped a number for a <em>number</em> of reasons, so while the name is a bit strange, there are some definitive upgrades to be aware of.</p><p>But the OnePlus 15 also isn't an upgrade in every area. It's got worse camera sensors — although our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">OnePlus 15 camera review</a> proves that OnePlus's new camera software makes up for that — and many people aren't crazy about the clearly iPhone-inspired changes to the hardware and operating system.</p><p>Thankfully, OnePlus makes up for this in other areas. The battery life is beyond stellar and is easily the best among any flagship phone in existence today. Charging is faster than ever, a feat that's made even better by the inclusion of a charger in the box, and performance is literally chart-topping, especially if you're a mobile gamer. Is this the right phone for you? Let's look at what makes it better and worse than the competition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

If these three categories are important to you, buy the OnePlus 15. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15 review</a> points out just how much better each of these categories is than the competition, and it's not even close.</p><p>You'll get at least 2 full days on a single charge, owing to a massive 7,300mAh battery that's about 50% larger than most smartphone batteries. Because OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">is using electric car battery tech</a>, the phone actually weighs less than the competition despite the battery's size. And when you have to charge it, the packed-in charger will give you a <em>full</em> charge in under 45 minutes, again, despite the larger size.</p><p>All of that is packed into an even stronger frame that boasts IP66, IP68, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, and IP69K ratings. Most phones just have IP68, which is great for everyday life, but OnePlus is protecting its phones against everything you could possibly do, even including high heat and water jets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">Only Honor offers anything even close</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ai56bJTPyEDhAwbaYamqKN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ai56bJTPyEDhAwbaYamqKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display on the OnePlus 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">is the best I've ever tested</a>. It's a brilliant 165Hz OLED that sports tons of wonderful eye care features that annihilate anything Google or Samsung are doing today. While the Pixel 10 Pro family gets brighter by a few hundred nits, the OnePlus 15 is just a tad brighter than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, all without nasty low-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> that hurts my eyes.</p><p>Since the display runs at up to 165Hz, OnePlus has partnered with a handful of popular game developers to ensure that popular titles like Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG run at 165Hz with no stuttering or frame drops. OnePlus also implemented a new dedicated touch response chip that ensures the action follows your finger movements faster than any phone, and in my testing, that's definitely the case.</p><p>And while the camera isn't faster than the OnePlus 13, the front and primary sensors deliver better quality than that phone in any light. That's saying quite a bit, given how good the OnePlus 13's main camera sensor was. The OnePlus 15 also includes better video recording, including 4k120 video and full LOG and RAW options.</p><h2 id="what-s-worse-2">What's worse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="J5CqnRhHYVuPJuJZ9364RN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J5CqnRhHYVuPJuJZ9364RN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus made some radical design changes with the OnePlus 15 that have become a point of contention among fans. While some laud the new "clean design" language, many others — including myself — are sick of seeing Android phones bow to Apple's overly flat and boxy design language. OnePlus had an excellent thing going with the OnePlus 13's ergonomics, and this phone is anything but ergonomic.</p><p>If you put a case on your phone, you may not care as much, but there's no doubt that a lot of what made OnePlus phones look unique is gone with the OnePlus 15. One of the worst losses is the Alert Slider, a wholly unique three-way toggle switch that has graced nearly every major OnePlus phone since the OnePlus 2.</p><p>OnePlus got ripped a new one when it removed the Alert Slider on the OnePlus 10T, but this time around, it replaced the Alert Slider with a "Plus Key" that's semi-customizable. Why the company couldn't just add a Plus Key above or below the Alert Slider is confounding, but by removing a fan favorite feature, the company has irritated long-time followers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-05" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My initial impressions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">OxygenOS 16</a> on the OnePlus 13 were quite positive, but my excitement for the latest OnePlus operating system update has waned since then. I've run across a number of annoying bugs that weren't present in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, and while OnePlus has added more features to its theme engine, it's still overly difficult to find, buried in settings instead of being on the home screen.</p><p>OnePlus also opted to default to several iOS-style UI options on the OnePlus 15, yet again annoying fans who didn't ask for an iPhone clone. You can change these options, thankfully, but there was no reason for OnePlus to make these alternate designs the default other than to blindly copy iOS.</p><p>It's also worth noting the areas where the OnePlus 15's camera is worse than the OnePlus 13. Low-light capture takes longer for all sensors, and while the front and main lenses are better in most cases, the telephoto and ultrawide sensors were downgraded. Since there's no Hasselblad branding, the popular XPAN mode is also gone.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-2">Should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vXNjaAyjF6Xp6ynihZ2vEe" name="oneplus-15-sand-storm-back-04" alt="The back of the Sand Storm OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXNjaAyjF6Xp6ynihZ2vEe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At $899, this phone still offers a better value than comparable models by Samsung and Google, including better battery life, faster charging, a better display, a more durable build, and faster performance. Ironically, OnePlus no longer has the edge on a more comfortable design with the latest changes, as each of these companies now uses a boring iPhone-like boxy design on its latest models.</p><p>OnePlus offers four OS updates and six years of security updates, which is short of the seven that both Samsung and Google offer. I won't call this "worse" even though the numbers are lower because I don't think it negatively affects any meaningful percentage of users, but it's something to keep in mind if you hold on to phones for more than 7 years.</p><p>Spending $999 on the model with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage still saves you around $300 compared to Google and Samsung, and gives you access to more storage and even better multitasking capabilities. While I would have liked to see better camera sensors and less iOS-inspired OS design, it's hard to argue with saving hundreds of bucks while still getting so many advantages over the competition.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="134fbe85-41db-4620-9dd3-62c4d6ca49f5">            <a href="http://oneplus.com/us/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cEpTdp6SfKko9Yx8EA8kKk.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>OnePlus</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Despite it's generic design, the OnePlus 15 is one of the best phones you can buy today.

It supports Zigbee, Thread, and, most importantly, Matter, which is quickly becoming the glue that ties together different brands’ smart devices.</p><h2 id="smarter-proactive-automations-2">Smarter, proactive automations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="YNv7ypJJ6TZtwUURbbw36R" name="Aeotec-Smart-Home-Hub-2" alt="Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 with a TV in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YNv7ypJJ6TZtwUURbbw36R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>SmartThings already works with thousands of products, and adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> support makes it even easier to use different brands together. Samsung is also adding smarter automation features, such as climate control that adjusts based on who is home, better monitoring for leaks and smoke, and air-quality sensors that help your home respond to daily changes.</p><p>It’s the kind of hub meant to sit at the center of a home filled with smart bulbs, sensors, switches, appliances—you name it—and quietly coordinate everything without needing your constant attention.</p><p>The Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartthings/hub/aeotec-smart-home-hub-2-sku-207025/" target="_blank">priced at $120</a>, making it a mid-range upgrade that seems fair for the new features. However, unlike its predecessor, this new version has dropped Z-Wave support. If you were banking on this hub managing your older Z-Wave devices, you’ll need a separate dongle or gateway.</p><p>Still, for most people interested in newer Matter and Thread devices, the Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 shows Samsung’s effort to become a bigger part of the growing smart home market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is catching up to Apple in terms of ecosystem features and integration, but it still has work to do. There are many Apple ecosystem features that currently have no equivalent on Android, like NameDrop — an NFC-based contact sharing tool. However, that might be changing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contact-gesture-exchange-apk-teardown-3615939/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> uncovered the early workings of a Contact Exchange feature that could make for easy contact sharing in a future Android update.</p><p>Android Authority first spotted code referring to NFC data sharing in version 25.44.32 of the Google Play Services beta. The code included nods to "Gesture Exchange," "ContactExchangeActivity," and "ndef." The latter term is probably a shortened version of NFC Data Exchange format, according to the report.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="gestureexchange_ndef_aid_description">Gesture Exchange</string><string name="gestureexchange_ndef_service_description">Gesture Exchange</string></code></pre><p>A newer version of Google Play Services, v25.46.31, allowed tinkerer AssembleDebug to activate what could be Android's upcoming contact sharing interface. While these are clear signs Google is working on an easier way to share contact cards on Android, much like NameDrop, we don't yet know what the feature will be called. Or, if it relies entirely on NFC.</p><h2 id="what-could-android-s-namedrop-alternative-look-like-2">What could Android's NameDrop alternative look like?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGWDcoTkdNLtye2kkSm4GH" name="Contant-Sharing-Android" alt="The early contact sharing feature in Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGWDcoTkdNLtye2kkSm4GH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For context, Apple added NameDrop with iOS 17, so it's been available on iPhones for a few years now. Users create Contact Posters — which Google already brought to Android in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-material-3-expressive-redesign-rolls-out">Calling Cards</a> — with their name and a picture.</p><p>When they hold the top of their iPhone to another, they have the option to share their Contact Poster and contact information. The gesture can also be used to start SharePlay for communal movie-watching or game-playing.</p><p>The upcoming Android equivalent is less flashy at the moment, but that could change before the feature might release. It has fields for a photo, name, phone number, and email. There are checkboxes that let users select exactly what contact fields will be shared with another person. You also see a <strong>Receive only</strong> option that'll share nothing with the other person.</p><p>After successfully using Contact Exchange, Android shows a screen confirming receipt and the contact details. From there, Android users could save the contact details transferred wirelessly to their phone and Google account.</p><p>It's unclear when, or if, Contact Exchange might publicly release for Android users. Considering Google already borrowed iOS 17's other flagship feature, Contact Posters, it wouldn't be surprising to see it take inspiration from NameDrop as well.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While it's still a round watch face, the chamfered edges on the bottom are largely gone, replaced by cleaner, flatter sides. This is likely due to the inclusion of the flashlight tucked into the top of the watch. There are also fewer, smaller buttons on one side of the watch, which makes it look less like a sports watch and gives it more mainstream appeal.</p><p>Owners of the Venu 3 will notice that the Venu 4 is noticeably thicker and heavier. I find that the weight is fairly manageable, but after a while, the heavy stainless steel case begins to feel somewhat uncomfortable, to the point where I have to take the watch off.</p><p>The side and weight are mostly a problem when wearing the watch in bed. I already don't care to wear smartwatches when I sleep, but the Venu 4 is particularly uncomfortable at night, and I find the weight quite noticeable.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WyW7xtNLf2SBT6XKwm5STR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-18" alt="Garmin Venu 4 and Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WyW7xtNLf2SBT6XKwm5STR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="a7GtLzbYjZc4DV5TTWnVLR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-16" alt="Garmin Venu 4 and Venu 3 upside down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7GtLzbYjZc4DV5TTWnVLR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iTBpibvjvgFKeDhWin7ofQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-15" alt="Garmin Venu 4 next to the Venu 3 face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTBpibvjvgFKeDhWin7ofQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hYyPX5oqwKSx2wx7abYbMQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-20" alt="Garmin Venu 4 next to the Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYyPX5oqwKSx2wx7abYbMQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4069px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="csAH29kGYALvpVGZfTGKBQ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-17" alt="Garmin Venu 4 and Venu 3 thickness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/csAH29kGYALvpVGZfTGKBQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4069" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The 45mm model I'm using has a rather sizeable 1.4-inch display with a 454 x 454 resolution.

The watch undercuts the Venu 4 by roughly $100 but is packed with impressive features like a 1.3-inch AMOLED touch display with sapphire glass, 41 hours of dual-band GPS, and a 24-day battery life overall. That said, you won't get the same perks as those found on Garmin, such as a flashlight, daily workout suggestions, better music apps, contactless payments, and arguably a better display.</p><p>On the smartwatch side, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a>. This is roughly the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">original Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, just with additional storage. However, it features a more rugged design, offers excellent battery life, and comes with Wear OS for access to a wide range of apps and seamless connectivity to your smartphone. However, battery life still falls short compared to the Venu 4, and Garmin's focus on fitness first over smarts may be what you're looking for, especially if you can get it for $100 less than the Galaxy Watch.</p><p>Finally, the Forerunner 570 may be another Garmin watch you're considering. These two watches are very similar in terms of feature set and price. The Forerunner is more focused on runners, complete with more buttons for easy navigation. Meanwhile, the Venu 4 is a more all-rounder for any fitness</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-venu-4-should-you-buy-it"><span>Garmin Venu 4: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3784px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Urfr6hwyN7HHuBm34aVXoZ" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-1" alt="Garmin Venu 4 on barbell plates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Urfr6hwyN7HHuBm34aVXoZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3784" height="2129" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You're a fitness enthusiast, such as a runner, weightlifter, or even someone wanting to start their fitness journey.</li><li>You want a stylish fitness watch with long battery life and a bright display.</li><li>You want a Garmin watch but don't want to spend Forerunner 970 amounts of money.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You like to use your smartwatch to track your sleep.</li><li>You want a smartwatch that syncs well with your smartphone.</li><li>You're beginning your fitness journey and want an affordable fitness watch to start.</li></ul><p>While the Venu 4 doesn't appear significantly different from its predecessor at first glance, that doesn't make it any less of a solid fitness smartwatch.

It's also a rather heavy watch, but if you can get past that, sleep tracking features are great, and many of the new features make the Venu 4 feel like a much more comprehensive health and fitness companion than its predecessor.</p><p>A Forerunner may be better suited for runners, but the Venu 4 feels like the everyman's watch. It's perfect for people like me who are focused on weightlifting and/or are casual to intermediate gym-goers willing to spend a little more to track their progress.

Carriers dangle these shiny new devices, promising the latest tech with seemingly no upfront cost, especially during times like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday's deal-a-thon</a>. It's an enticing proposition, the equivalent of finding a twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk. But, as with most things that seem too good to be true, a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. Because, behind that promise of "free," or ultra-cheap often lies a maze of fine print, long-term commitments, and cleverly disguised costs.</p><h2 id="a-trip-down-memory-lane-2">A trip down memory lane</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.00%;"><img id="8HDuDsfmbtBuYboiqqNQTV" name="thumb_550_verizon-htc-thunderbolt-vznav.jpg" alt="HTC Thunderbolt VZNavigator" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8HDuDsfmbtBuYboiqqNQTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="550" height="385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>To truly understand the current landscape, let's take a small historical detour.</p><p>Back when smartphones were first becoming a thing, cellular carriers (at least in North America) were all in with a multi-year contract. Phones were "subsidized," their upfront cost significantly reduced, in exchange for your loyalty and a hefty monthly payment. We were, in essence, slowly paying off the phone through inflated service fees.</p><p>Then came the smartphone boom, and it changed everything. These pocket computers came with premium price tags. Carriers, sensing the shift, introduced installment plans, allowing customers to pay off the device over time. And then, the "free" phone re-emerged, cleverly disguised as monthly bill credits as a reward for sticking around for the long haul. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/protect-your-trade-in-from-thieves">Trade-ins</a> became a prominent feature, allowing users to offset the cost of a new device by turning in their old one.</p><p>Today, the game has intensified. We're in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">5G era</a>, and flagship phones are more expensive than ever. The "free" phone offer persists, often requiring lengthy payment plans (up to 36 months!), enrollment in premium unlimited data plans, and a trade-in of your current device. Some carriers even offer to pay off your existing contract if you switch, as a way to grease the wheels.</p><p>You can find a deal for a free or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">extremely cheap phone</a> from even MVNOs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> just sent me an email telling me how they want to reward my loyalty by selling me a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series phone with $500 or more in coupons.</p><p>It seems like one weird way to make money, doesn't it?</p><h2 id="the-nitty-gritty-how-this-actually-works-2">The nitty gritty: how this actually works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU" name="Moto-G-2026-colors" alt="Moto G 2026 colors next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKwAjrcuiW4RbYgzhz3SVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's dissect the mechanics of these free and uber-cheap phone offers, and see how a carrier can give stuff away and still make money.</p><p><strong>The bill credit tango:</strong> This is the heart of the "free" phone illusion. You technically <em>purchase</em> the phone on an installment plan, committing to monthly payments. However, the carrier then applies a corresponding monthly credit to your bill, effectively "canceling out" the phone's cost... <em><strong>as long as you remain a customer</strong></em>. The moment you decide to leave, those credits vanish, and you're responsible for the remaining balance. It's designed to keep you captive.</p><p><strong>Trade-in tech-trade-offs:</strong> Handing over your old phone is often a big part of these deals. The "credit" you receive depends heavily on the phone's condition, and you're essentially relinquishing any future value it might hold.</p><p><strong>Plan changes and price hikes:</strong> These phone deals are often contingent on subscribing to a premium, unlimited data plan. While unlimited data might seem appealing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">are you <em>actually</em> using it</a>? You might find yourself paying significantly more each month for a service you don't fully utilize.</p><p><strong>Surprise!:</strong> Don't be fooled into thinking you'll walk away without spending a dime. Sales tax on the <em>full retail price</em> of the phone, activation fees, and upgrade fees are all common additions that aren't exactly cheap.</p><p><strong>The handcuffs:</strong> Your new phone is often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-i-know-whether-my-phone-unlocked">locked to the carrier's network</a> until it's fully paid off. This means you can't simply pop in a SIM card from another provider if you find yourself in an area with poor coverage.</p><h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-hidden-pros-cons-of-saving-money-this-way-2">The good, the bad, and the hidden: Pros & cons of saving money this way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVxhdHofgz3oQ5uB86kJE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before you give in to the temptation, weigh the potential benefits against the inherent risks. There are pros and cons to every phone and every deal.</p><p><strong>Why You Might Say YES! (The Pros):</strong></p><p>✔️ You get a new device without a substantial upfront investment.</p><p>✔️ Potentially gain access to better network coverage and faster internet speeds.</p><p>✔️ Unlock access to bundled perks, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/t-mobile-free-apple-tv-plus-magenta-max">streaming service subscriptions</a>.</p><p>✔️ Switching carriers often means your existing contract is bought out.</p><p>✔️ You upgrade to the latest and greatest without an immediate, significant financial hit.</p><p><strong>The Reality Check (The Cons & Controversies):</strong></p><p>✖️ It's not truly "free"; the cost is simply distributed over an extended period.</p><p>✖️ A long-term commitment (24-36 months) restricts your flexibility.</p><p>✖️ You may have to subscribe to a more expensive plan to qualify.</p><p>✖️ Trade-in requirements can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sell-your-android-device">undervalue your old device</a>.</p><p>✖️ Hidden fees can unexpectedly inflate the overall cost.</p><p>✖️ Carrier lock-in can restrict your device's functionality on other networks.</p><p>Before you jump on one of these deals, take the time to think about how it will work for you. A few things make a difference, and most of the time we don't even think about them until it's too late.</p><p>The biggest is to assess your data consumption accurately. Avoid paying for unused data, as the deal will never be worth it when you're already paying a premium for something you never use. Think of the monthly bill from the carrier as a payment for the phone.</p><p>Determine any early termination fees or remaining device balances with your current carrier if you plan to switch for a great deal.

The experience was something I'll never forget, and even though practically every modern piece of electronics today has some sort of haptic response in it, the joy of feeling the action in a game hasn't waned.</p><p>That's why you need to pick up the next-generation Woojer Vest 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""><strong>which is $50 off</strong></a> right now on an early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> special. The Vest 4 just came out a few weeks ago (it's not even a month old!) and upgrades the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/woojer-haptic-vest-3">Woojer Vest 3</a> experience with a new lighter, slimmer and more breathable construction that makes wearing the vest while gaming much more comfortable.</p><p>Not only that, but it debuted at just $349, a huge improvement over the $499 price of the Vest 3. That's made even better by this sale, which brings it down to $299.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9361c59d-6805-40da-b996-b5c24dd9586c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Woojer's next-generation haptic vest is here, and it's lighter, more comfortable, and sleeker than ever.

It's a way to experience <em>full body</em> rumble from your games, music, movies, or anything else in your life that makes sound. Woojer's patented technology intelligently turns sound into haptic feedback, and it does so without mixing in the noises you don't want.</p><p>Assume you're playing an online game like Call of Duty or even a VR game like Forefront and want to feel the shooting and explosions, but not the voices of the other players. Woojer <em>already</em> automatically cancels out things like voices and music while gaming because it understands that gamers want to feel effects, not ambient music or other players' voices.</p><p>Conversely, if you're playing a game like Lumines Arise on your Steam Deck, the pumping bass of the music will perfectly vibrate into your <em>inner soul</em> thanks to the Woojer Vest 4. It's impressively immersive and brings a whole new dimension to all your entertainment. I use it every time I play a VR multiplayer game like Breachers or Forefront, but it's also excellent for non-VR games when you really want to get in on the action.</p><h2 id="how-does-a-haptic-vest-work-2">How does a haptic vest work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj" name="woojer-series-3-app-main-screen" alt="The Woojer app with a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're using a Woojer Vest 4, Woojer Body Strap, or one of Woojer's older products, they all work the same way. You load the Woojer app onto your smartphone and then turn on your Woojer vest. The app automatically connects to your Vest or Body Strap and gives you full control over the volume, haptic intensity, mode, and more.</p><p>From here, you'll either plug a pair of wired headphones into the Woojer unit or pair Bluetooth headphones <strong>to the Woojer</strong> via the app, matching the vibration perfectly in sync with the sound. Lastly, you'll plug your source into the Woojer unit — I most commonly connect my Meta Quest 3 or Steam Deck via the included 3.5mm audio cable — to feed sound into the Vest or Body Strap. You can also use Bluetooth to wirelessly stream your music to the vest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n8LAeNEzqvnq6ueWhS5Jd4" name="woojer-body-strap-4-with-steam-deck" alt="A Woojer Body Strap 4 next to a Steam Deck playing Lumines Arise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8LAeNEzqvnq6ueWhS5Jd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's it! There's no other configuration needed unless you want to select a specific mode or change settings in the Woojer app. It's impressively simple and is far easier than how older haptic vests and straps used to work. I enjoy this most for gaming, but they're also great for really feeling the beat in your music or turning an average at-home movie into a theater-like experience with full body rumble.</p><p>If a full vest is too much for you, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/woojer-high-fidelity-haptic-body-strap-4-for-vr-games-music-movies-and-wellness/apd/ad429979/gaming-gaming-accessories">Woojer Body Strap 4</a> is also available (pictured above next to the Steam Deck) and offers a single point of rumble that can be placed on your chest, stomach, back, or even your leg, if you prefer.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-22">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Whether you love it or hate it, it's in everyone's face and isn't about to go away.</p><p>This one's a little different, though, because Yahoo and YouGov recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/article/poll-most-americans-think-ai-will-destroy-humanity-someday-212132958.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank">released the results of a survey</a> in which most Americans responded that AI will surpass the ability of normal folks and maybe even one day destroy us all.</p><p>Oh boy. Now we're talking!</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Unfortunately, I wasn't surveyed and couldn't find any credible claims from anyone who was. Maybe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-gemini-ai-image-generation-faults">AI hallucinated</a> the poll? Probably not. In any case, the poll responses are informative and downright amazing:</p><ul><li>According to the poll, 61% of Americans say it’s somewhat or very likely that “AI will continue to improve, but it will never surpass human intelligence.”</li><li>Additionally, 64% of Americans say it’s somewhat or very likely that “AI will be able to perform any intellectual task a human can.”</li><li>Of those surveyed, 60% of Americans say it’s somewhat or very likely that “AI will become so intellectually advanced that it will help us solve complex problems like curing cancer and stopping climate change.”</li><li>Additionally, 63% of Americans say it’s somewhat or very likely that “AI will become so intellectually advanced that humans won’t be able to control it anymore.”</li><li>Finally, 53% of Americans say it’s somewhat or very likely that “AI will destroy humanity.”</li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji" name="google-io-ai-google-gemini-action-intelligence" alt="Gemini Action Intelligence at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My takeaways from all of this might not be as enlightening. The first thing that comes to mind is a significant aspect of the broader "AI problem": regular people don't fully understand it, and the companies presenting it to us want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas" target="_blank">make us believe</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas"> it's magical</a>.</p><p>I've said this before, and I'll say it again: <strong>machinery is not intelligent</strong>. People who make it look that way are, though. It's all code, and the only thinking and learning being done is by the folks programming it. When my Nvidia processor can truly learn, maybe I'll get better at playing Rainbow 6.</p><p>Having said all that, I would have responded mostly the same way as the majority here, though. 😲AI will keep advancing and eventually be a help with things like the fight against cancer. It will also become something even more terrible than it is now and could potentially lead humanity down the path of extinction, just like the Dodo, and it's all because of us.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pZoNjXPX6izDXqhWpBhoDD" name="Gemini-Robot-1" alt="Robot arms picking up objects with Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZoNjXPX6izDXqhWpBhoDD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People seem to have a knack for wrecking everything. AI is already making a lot of that easier because everyone has access to it, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-using-gemini-to-keep-latest-online-scammers-in-check">scammers</a>, thieves, and other types of human pond scum that will do anything and not care how it affects others. This is what's going to bite us in the ass, and if it doesn't kill us all, it will change everything.</p><p>Part of the reason is that we want to believe what we see, hear, or read. Maybe there is no Jerry, and I'm just an AI written by a middle-aged woman in a Boston apartment. That sounds like a drug-induced dream, but unless you are right here and can physically interact with me, you can't be sure.

You should because you <em><strong>have</strong></em> believed nonsense churned out by AI at least once. So have I, so has everyone. I don't mean AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-enable-spell-check-on-chromebooks">Chrome's spellchecker</a>, which makes you think I have a mastery of the English language, but rather 100% inauthentic nonsense on the web designed to provoke a specific response.</p><p>If you have an agenda, you can let AI push push push it for you without much effort, thanks to social media and other online interaction. It only needs to work a little bit to sway public opinion or trick you into spending money.</p><p>This is how AI has the potential to bring about the fall of humanity. There won't be any T-9000 Terminator-class killbots rampaging across the landscape (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAUj4nc9M3k" target="_blank">or maybe they will?</a>). Instead, society could turn into a dystopian nightmare where the only folks who seem sane are like your Luddite uncle who thinks all this is just hogwash.</p><p>And we will welcome it, under the guise of curing cancer or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">making our lives easier</a>.
