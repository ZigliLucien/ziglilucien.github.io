<ul><li>Samsung rumors suggest the company is interested in upgrading the selfie camera of its Galaxy S25 FE.</li><li>The device could sport a 12MP selfie camera, which is suspected to deliver "better quality" photos, as it has been stuck with 10MP for a few generations.</li><li>Older rumors claim the S25 FE could launch in the "second half" of 2025 with MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 powerhouse.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's another member of the Galaxy S25 era that we're waiting for, and this new rumor states it might come with an upgrade.</p><p>Rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25-fe/">Galaxy Club</a> (Dutch) suggest Samsung could bring a long-awaited upgrade to its expected Galaxy S25 FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-fe-gets-an-upgraded-selfie-camera-after-two-years/">SamMobile</a>). The "FE" part of this series stands for "Fan Edition," and things are kept pretty tame compared to Samsung's flagships. However, the publication's sources suggest the S25 FE will upgrade its selfie camera to 12MP.</p><p>With that, the safest piece of speculation is that consumers will be able to take "better selfies," as the post also notes.</p><p>Additionally, this rumor seemingly places the Galaxy S25 FE's selfie camera on the same level as its flagship counterparts. However, the publication is hesitant to speak on its true quality because, remember, FE is more budget-oriented.</p>
<h2 id="the-trail-so-far-2">The trail so far</h2>

<p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 lineup features a 12MP camera. Looking at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-cameras">our review of the base S25's</a>, there's not really much to write home about. The device's front camera does its job, offering a decent selfie experience, but it's nothing major. If the Galaxy S25 FE is to follow this trail, perhaps we already know what we're in for. However, the upgrade is nice, considering Samsung hasn't improved its FE's selfie camera for a couple of generations.</p><p>On the other hand, we're still unclear about its rear camera system. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">S24 FE</a> features a triple array with a 50MP primary, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. There's always hope for some improvement here, maybe with its telephoto, but don't hold your breath about it. Samsung typically keeps these things the same for a while before changing.</p><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s25-fe-might-pack-a-pleasant-hardware-twist">rumors claim</a> Samsung could hunt down MediaTek for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC for the S25 FE. Supposedly, the Korean OEM had originally wanted its in-house Ecynos chip inside, but sudden production issues have forced it into an alternative. MediaTek's chip is strong; however, and is the company's answer to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Rumors claim Samsung could launch the Galaxy S25 FE in the "second half" of 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly switching gears, and chasing a different type of battery material known as "SUS CAN."</li><li>This material is designed to increase battery capacity, meaning future phones, like the Galaxy S26, could have "significantly" bigger capacities.</li><li>Old rumors claimed Samsung would chase silicon-carbon batteries; however, any upgrade would be nice as we've been stuck in 2019 with the same old, same old.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New information has allegedly come to light about Samsung's upgraded battery tech in its next wave of Galaxy phones.</p><p>The latest report arrives courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/tN3xAqF6Sg">The Elec</a> (Korean), which claims Samsung might've changed its mind about its (hopeful) battery tech upgrade (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1922928235974885882">Jukanlosreve</a>). This isn't "bad," technically, as the report says Samsung might look toward a different material, known as "SUS CAN." As the post notes, the purpose of this material swap is to finally provide stronger, longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>The tipster highlights the change could facilitate a "significant increase in battery capacity."</p><p>The publication's sources allege the SUS CAN is a "stainless steel" material that's currently in development by Samsung SDI. It's also worth mentioning that this same tech is inside Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max. This material change has two key focuses: boost energy density and improve Galaxy's charging speeds. Both of these areas would be welcome upgrades for Samsung's Galaxy phone line, which has become pretty stagnant.</p><p>More importantly, there's a chance we could see this battery tech arrive on the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p>
<h2 id="any-battery-upgrade-is-welcome-2">Any battery upgrade is welcome</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Korean media reports that Samsung plans to adopt a new technology in its next-generation model that could significantly increase battery capacity.According to the report, the technology involves a stainless steel material being developed by Samsung SDI, commonly referred to in…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1922928235974885882">May 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Additionally, sources claim SUS CAN could also reduce battery swelling. Speaking plainly, this would, ideally, increase the longevity of the battery, as one that swells is a telltale sign that it's time to chuck it.</p><p>Rumors that Samsung's future batteries could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">finally catch up to the competition</a> started earlier in February. That report came from FNNews (Korean), which alleged Samsung was chasing silicon-carbon batteries. We've seen this tech in a few places, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">like Honor's Magic 7 Pro</a>, which provides better durability and faster charging. Like the current rumors, those from February stated we may see this tech in "future Galaxy phones."</p><p>There's also speculation that Samsung's batteries could debut anywhere from 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh. There's nothing concrete about what sort of charging speeds Samsung could strive for, but hey, we can dream of something more than 45W.</p><p>If 45W grinds your gears, it's because Samsung has provided that same charging strength on its Ultra model for the past three generations. Essentially, we're all still vibing back in 2019. Samsung did work in a little magic with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> battery, bringing slightly faster charging, but it's clearly not cutting it.</p>

Instead, that shiny new key on your Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro is actually for the Essential Space, a brand new AI hub from Nothing. It's like an AI-powered memory for all your smartphone needs, housing photos, screenshots, notes, and voice memos in a singular place.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> have a lot of competition in the midrange smartphone market, Essential Space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">could be the differentiating factor</a>. If you're curious how to use Essential Space or how it might fit into your daily life, this guide will tell you everything there is to know about it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-essential-space-2">What is Essential space?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B" name="Essential-Key-Summarize" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Essential Space is a new software feature Nothing introduced on the Phone 3a series that collects notes, screenshots, photos, and voice memos of your choosing. Then, it uses AI to summarize and analyze the information provided, creating action items. For example, if you upload a coupon to Essential Space, you might get a smartphone reminder to use it before it's about to expire.</p><p>For the most part, you interact with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-3a-pro-essential-key-update-3-1">Essential Space</a> using the Essential Key — the shiny dedicated button on the right side of your Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA" name="Essential-Key-Stacked" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can organize your thoughts with Collections, which are effectively folders that can be used to sort everything in your Essential Space. For now, there's no way to create a new note directly within the Essential Space — everything starts by pressing the Essential Key and taking a screenshot, photo, or recording a voice memo.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-save-photos-and-screenshots-to-essential-space-2">How to save photos and screenshots to Essential Space</h2>
<p>You can capture and save screenshots to Essential Space in seconds using the Essential Key. It's easier than using the standard Android shortcut, since you only need to press one button instead of two. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. Quickly <strong>click the Essential Key</strong> to take a screenshot.</p><p>2. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your screenshot and any notes to Essential Space.</p>

<p>In a post-launch OTA update, Nothing added the ability to capture photos with the Essential Key, which are saved to the Essential Space. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Camera app</strong>.</p><p>2. <strong>Quickly press the Essential Key</strong> to snap a photo.</p><p>3. Optionally use the <strong>text bar or voice icon</strong> to add a note.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>yellow arrow button </strong>to save your photo and any notes to Essential Space.</p>

<p>After that, you'll be able to access and analyze your photos, screenshots, and attached notes in the Essential Space — we'll cover how to do that later on.</p>

<p>Essential Space might be best viewed as a combination of a few different app ideas, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> and Pixel Recorder. For instance, you can save voice recordings to the Essential Space where they'll be transcribed and analyzed, just like you could on a Pixel. Here's how to do it on your Nothing phone:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Long-press the Essential Key </strong>to start a voice recording.</p><p>2.<strong> Keep the Essential Key pressed </strong>to continue recording,</p><p>3. <strong>Let go of the Essential Key</strong> to stop and save the recording.</p>

<p>You can then find your saved, transcribed recordings in the Essential Space app.</p>

<p>After you've captured photos, screenshots, and notes with Essential Space, you'll want to go back and view them. To do so, you can double-click the Essential Key from anywhere to open the app. You can also find it in your app drawer. Here are all the tips and tricks you'll need to know to manage your Essential Space:</p>
<p>1. Double-click the Essential Key to open Essential Space.</p><p>2. You'll see recent and suggested items at the top of the Essential Space homepage.</p><p>3.

<p>Every smartphone brand is trying to pave its own path with AI, and Nothing's version of that is the Essential Space. It can't replace your notes app, but it can be a better way of organizing your photos, screenshots, and voice recordings than having them scattered across multiple apps.</p><p>Plus, Nothing has already expressed willingness to update and grow Essential Space's feature set, so it could improve further over time. It's a key benefit of purchasing a Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro, especially in the U.S., where cellular support is otherwise limited.</p>

<ul><li>Sony announced its new WH-1000XM6 headphones that take a strong focus on the noise-cancellation aspect of audio.</li><li>The company says its stretchable ear cups should limit fatigue over long periods of use, but they also enhance the noise-cancellation aspect of the device.</li><li>The headphones feature 12 microphones that work to automatically adjust your sound, so users remain immersed in audio without disruption.</li><li>The WH-1000XM6 is available today (May 15) in black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue for $449 ($599 CAD).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony's latest wireless headphones are here, and they've arrived with a mechanism that makes their transportation a whole lot easier.</p><p>In a press release (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-introduces-the-best-noise-cancellation-with-the-wh-1000xm6-headphones-302456593.html">PR Newswire</a>), Sony highlighted the launch of its WH-1000XM6 headphones. The company mentions a few key aspects about the device, most notably its "premium sound." According to Sony, its latest headphones were created alongside the music industry's top recording studios, like Sterling Sound, Battery Studios, and Coast Mastering.</p><p>Regarding the device, Randy Merrill, mastering engineer from Sterling Sound, said the headphones "transport me to a different world with their excellent bass, frequency response, soundstage and detail and truthfully represent the sounds of the recordings that we work so hard to make."</p><p>Internally, the headphones are powered by Sony's HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3. The processor is said to achieve speeds that are "seven times faster" than its previous edition. Moreover, the WH-1000XM6 features 12 microphones (not a typo). Sony says this helps bring about a leap in noise-cancelling performance, as each mic adjusts your device for more immersive listening in noisy scenarios.</p><p>The headphone's Auto Ambient Sound mode will adjust your audio to the sound around you, so you don't miss a beat. Sony says you can use its Sound Connect app to adjust these settings manually or let the headphones do it themselves.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1657px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XX7R3USgnnA8Dn7Z33o9yD" name="sony-wh-1000xm6-noise-cancelling-on-a-table" alt="A pair of Sony's newest headphones in white sitting on in a music studio against a soundboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XX7R3USgnnA8Dn7Z33o9yD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1657" height="932" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to Sony's design, the WH-1000XM6 feature a folding mechanism, which the post states its "durable." The fold makes the headphones a little smaller and more manageable inside bags or airplane pocket, per Sony. Consumers can also find these headphones with a new compact case with a magnetic lock.</p><p>The headphones themselves feature an "elegant, soft fit wider headband featuring synthetic leather ensuring a pressure-free fit." Sony highlights the ear cups, stating they have been outfitted with a stretchable material that shouldn't give consumers too much fatigue over long periods of use.</p><p>Additionally, there is a responsive touch panel and controls that let users quickly swap between the following modes: noise cancellation, ambient sound, and mute mic.</p>

<p>Sony says its usage of "high rigidity carbon fiber composite material" and a new voice coil helps to bring out every note in your music. The post states voices should be clearer with more defined instrumentals. The headphones even support Edge-AI, which is said to return the full potential of sound that could've been lost during compression.</p><p>Feature-wise, the WH-1000XM6 delivers Quick Access and Scene-based Listening. Each can connect to your Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music account.</p><p>The noise-cancelling headphones let users continue with their tunes even when plugged in (USB) for a charge. However, the headphones are said to last "up to" 30 hours on a full charge with their noise cancellation active. Sony states users can get roughly three hours of power in just three minutes.</p><p>As the WH-1000XM6 headphones launch today (May 15), Sony says you might see its ad campaign with the GRAMMY Award-nominated Post Malone. The artist states, "These new noise-cancelling headphones make you feel completely inside the music."</p><p>Sony's newest headphones are available in black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue for $449 ($599 CAD). Consumers can look for them on Amazon, Best Buy, or Sony.com and other retailers.</p>

<p>As detective games, Shattered and Ghost Town couldn't be more different. In one, you play a paranormal detective with the power to seal away ghosts that can't seem to let go of this world. In the other, you're stuck in a mysterious mental facility, slowly losing your mind as you try to unravel the mystery of what brought you there.</p><p>Ghost Town is a fully immersive VR game made by the folks behind The Room VR, one of the most critically acclaimed games on the Meta Quest platform. Meanwhile, Shattered takes full advantage of the mixed reality capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, transforming your room into an interactive space that morphs along with the story.</p><p>Both games tell an incredible story that'll have you wondering what's next, not wanting to take the headset off until the mysteries have finally been solved. I haven't been this enamored with a detective game since that first Phoenix Wright release on the Nintendo DS eons ago. It's been incredible to don the detective hat once again and give myself a little taste of what being a modern-day Sherlock Holmes might feel like.</p>

<h2 id="entering-ghost-town-2">Entering Ghost Town</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/052hBB-f_EY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You are Edith Penrose, a paranormal detective who is finally getting her act together in life and becoming a success, just as your brother goes missing. But he didn't go missing in any traditional sense of the word. Rather, the event plays out in a haunted theater as the two of you are trying to exorcise the ghost of the show's lead actress, who was inadvertently murdered during opening night by a faulty prop knife.</p><p>The storytelling, animations, and voice acting are beyond what you would typically expect from a VR game. That's not to say that there are no VR games that feature these qualities, quite the opposite, considering titles like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> exist, but I've come to expect that most VR games will always have a bit of an indie, understated flair to them.</p><p>This level of quality holds true throughout the entirety of the game's experience. The graphics are among the best I've ever seen on the Quest 3 and look more like a PC game, with very few exceptions. The environmental detail is superb, and while not <em>everything</em> in the environments is interactive, the available interactions are all done supremely well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your roommate aglow with light from an ethereal stained glass window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5FEf42jx9qDZWXLSVfg67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Levers you pull and knobs you turn have a palpable weight to them. The environment feels like it actually exists all around you, even if this is just a fantasy story. The same feeling was also present in the studio's prior work, The Room VR, so while it's not surprising to see it carry over to another game, it still feels like a breath of fresh air in an era when even the biggest name games ship with ridiculously stupid bugs and other design problems.</p><p>Beyond just excellent base mechanics and environmental details, the game's puzzles, story, and settings are all incredibly well thought out and frightfully intriguing. I found myself thinking about the game hours after the end of a play session. It's a feeling I find happens most often with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> because of their unique spatial quality.</p><p>Solving the puzzles felt challenging and rewarding because the developers don't hold your hand, but they do leave enough hints in the area to help you understand what you're supposed to do and where you go next.  This quality is not often present in games, as it is very difficult to design environments so that the player has a general understanding of what they're supposed to do without having floating arrows or deliberate text telling players exactly what to do next.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-01" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing the complex machinery underneath the lighthouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9nFEadzLNaNoVGn9pVR67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can still request a hint via a cleverly devised notebook system when you get stuck. Hints are found in the pull-out tab on the bottom of the notebook, but these hints don't feel too obvious, and there was never a time when I felt like I needed the developers to directly tell me what to do next.</p><p>Players familiar with The Room series will feel right at home with the puzzles here. While there is generally more narrative attached to the puzzles than some of the ones that series has, the general feel of most puzzles is right in line with what I expect from this developer's pedigree. These aren't obscure, sometimes obtuse puzzles, as I feel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/riven-meta-quest-3-impressions">the Myst series</a> can suffer from. Rather, the puzzles feel in line with the story and the setting, no matter where you are in the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77" name="ghost-town-meta-quest-screenshot-03" alt="A screenshot from Ghost Town captured on a Meta Quest 3 showing your apartment building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZQdnUFgcYonQsJiHxbz77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love how many different locales you'll go through in this game and how many characters you'll talk to, as well. Solving the “puzzle” of how to turn on the stage lights in an antiquated theater is a great example of how practical many of the games' puzzles are versus other titles that might throw you into a world filled with a collection of weird puzzles that don't make any sense in the greater context.</p><p>So far, Ghost Town is my meta quest game of the year. We might only be in May and have plenty to look forward to before the end of the year, but something this high quality only comes along every once in a while. It's a game I highly recommend to all Meta Quest players, especially since there's a free demo you can try before committing to the price.</p>

<p>I've played a ton of incredible mixed reality games since the Meta Quest 3 came out in 2023, but few nail the execution as well as Shattered. Like all mixed reality games, Shattered places virtual objects around the room you're physically standing in. Suddenly, you'll find a new door or window on your wall and, of course, you're immediately compelled to see what's behind it.</p><p>That's when things start to get really trippy. Just like in games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">The Last Stand or Spatial Ops</a>, these windows and doors are portals to another world. The door you just opened might lead to your sister's apartment, or the office you swore you left at 5 o'clock.</p><p>These portals aren't just relegated to windows or doors, though. Sometimes, they're holes in the wall, or maybe a hatch on the floor that you'll have to unlock and peer down through. The first time you open the hatch and look through your physical floor into a completely different room is a thing of true amazement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna" name="shattered-meta-quest-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official mixed reality screenshot of Shattered taken on a Meta Quest 3 showing a memory playing out in a "portal" on a wall" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSdM6ePwanx7gsmoYH3Zna.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlaySide Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that portal isn't one you can walk through, only one you can see through. As such, you'll have to use your mind's powers to clone the room's objects by aiming at them and placing them in your physical space. In a way, it's like solving an escape room from the outside-in, and every new room feels fresh in a way that's physically impossible in real life.</p><p>As you make your way through each of the game's case files, which will take you around 4 hours to complete in total, objects will start to pile up in your room. While you can remove these objects when you're done with them, I enjoyed leaving as many as possible to remind myself what I'd solved up until this point.</p><p>The story is told in memory fragments that you'll grab and place around you, assembling each piece in your space like a Hollywood movie. It's an incredible feeling that's unmatched on the platform, and it's a game that simply wouldn't make sense outside of a mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>Google is redesigning how Wear OS will look on Pixel Watches. On the surface, Material 3 Expressive simply makes the UI more flashy and colorful. But I also believe it's a bit of a course correction to make the Pixel Watch 4 more appealing to core Pixel users.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">Android Show I/O edition</a> revealed what to expect from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> later this year. Scrolled content will "trace the curvature" of the rounded Pixel Watch display for smoother transitions, shrinking or expanding to match the available space.</p><p>They'll be better "responsive feedback" when tapping options, and your watch face theme will affect the colors throughout the UI.</p>

<p>Looks aside, Google promised "more engaging" Tiles with "quick access to information or actions," along with "space-efficient" notification buttons that convey more information. And, of course, Gemini will replace Assistant as your go-to Pixel Watch helper.</p><p>We'll see how much of a true smarts upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can offer on smartwatch hardware. But this update will align Pixel Watches closer with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. And as much as I personally loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Watch 3</a> for focusing so heavily on Fitbit, that route wouldn't work with Google's core audience in the long run.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-app-drawer" alt="The Wear OS 5 app drawer on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked my Android Central colleagues a few weeks back if they preferred stock Wear OS or One UI Watch on Galaxy Watches. It kicked off a fiery debate, and while several of us fell on the Pixel Watch side, our arguments were more about vibes than anything else. The One UI crowd had specifics.</p><p>Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, prefers One UI Watch "because it better mimics the UI on a smartphone," letting you swipe up or down to access apps or quick settings from any screen, or customize those quick settings. Stock Wear OS "feels oddly limited" while One UI Watch "feels more like Android."</p><p>Our contributor Brady Snyder called the Pixel Watch UI "unusable, more like a kid's toy or a Fitbit," saying it doesn't fully commit to either the smartwatch or fitness watch camp. He believes One UI "scales down to a smartwatch form factor" much better, and it displays fitness and health metrics in a more "engaging" way than stock Wear OS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Derrek declaring his side "correct," the debate is still fully subjective. But it's also true that there's a lot of style and feature continuity between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-one-ui-6-watch">One UI 6 Watch</a>, and the rumor is that the next version will bring familiar tools like the Now Bar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Stock Wear OS doesn't really feel like an extension of your Pixel phone software in the same way. Aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">cool watch faces</a>, there isn't much room for customization, as the interface is very minimalist, straightforward, and tailored. That will appeal to some people, but maybe not the core Android audience.</p>

But it's also true that its old audience loved Fitbits, in part, because they lasted a week per charge and had a simple interface. And many of these fans had iPhones.</p><p>No matter how much smarter Google makes Fitbit, those old fans aren't likely to pivot to a Pixel Watch that's not especially rugged, long-lasting, or affordable.</p><p>(Side note: I'm still annoyed that Google killed off Fitbit watches.)</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 catered to me as a runner; it had genuinely useful AI coaching and decent accuracy. But admittedly, I still prefer Garmin watches for all the reasons you'd expect. Only athletes who need a well-rounded experience would choose Google's 2-day smartwatch over any 7- or 14-day fitness watch.</p><p>Everyday Android users work out as much as anyone, but they were fine with something straightforward like Google Fit. What made people interested in a Pixel Watch was its <em>smarts</em>.</p><p>To Google's credit, it did make an effort with Wear OS 5 to add things like Nest Doorbell footage, Google TV controls, the Recorder app, and offline Google Maps. But it didn't upgrade the notifications, Tiles, or customization tools.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> could keep improving on the fitness front with cycling software, hiking maps in Google Maps, or rep counting at the gym. But that'll just be an important side dish, while the changes above will be the main course in making this watch more relevant for Android fans.</p><p>Google piggybacked on Gemini to sell a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-q3-2024-pixel-9-market-share-growth-report"> record number of Pixel 9s</a> last year, so it's no surprise that it would try to get its new AI on smartwatches as quickly as possible. In theory, Gemini Actions will transform the Wear OS experience by letting the AI do all the work of finding what you need.</p><p>And Material 3 Expressive, launched simultaneously on phones <em>and</em> watches, makes Wear OS 6 feel more like an extension of Android 16 instead of its own thing. I think that's a smart move on Google's part.</p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 970 and 570 have arrived with a bundle of new features, most notably new health sensors and a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling and voice commands.

The Forerunner 570 is 3g heavier in both sizes, but still much lighter than most smartwatches.</p><p>Garmin also says it has the "brightest AMOLED display on any Garmin smartwatch." While they couldn't share specific nits of brightness, it is "twice as bright" as other AMOLED models, which is a significant jump and will help make them more visible and colorful in direct sunlight.</p><p>Perhaps because of the brighter display and mic/speaker combo, the Forerunner 570 battery falls slightly short of the 265 (11 vs. 13 days), while the multi-band GPS hours are unchanged (14 hours). The Forerunner 265S lasted 15 days or 15 hours, while the smaller 570 42mm only lasts 10 days and 13 hours.</p>

<p>With the built-in mic and speaker, the Forerunner 570 will support Bluetooth calling, passthrough commands to your phone's Siri or Gemini, or on-watch commands. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-EECCAC99-90D6-4AB1-9A3A-EC433D3365E2/EN-US/GUID-5AA3DA43-FF89-4889-B897-CEF0A7E221C7.html">Fenix 8 owner's manual</a> lists out the kind of commands you can use, like starting a timer, changing music volume, or starting a workout.</p><p>You'll also get skin temperature changes in the Connect app, paired with your HRV score to help Garmin judge your sleep quality, recovery, and heat acclimation, while warning you of potential illness. You don't get ECG readings, however.</p><p>Garmin has confirmed that the Forerunner 570 and 970 both have the newest Elevate gen5 heart rate sensor, matching the Fenix 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. Since other 2025 watches like the Instinct 3 and Vivoactive 6 stuck to last-gen sensors, this is a gratifying upgrade that'll keep serious runners happy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-press-photo" alt="Several Garmin Forerunner 570 watches rendered in a black void, splayed along the left edge to create a slow-motion falling effect." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tLStnNiafTGvqN5UZfC3nF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Otherwise, all of the new Forerunner 570 features relate to software, starting with Evening Report. A complement to Morning Report, this version will remind you how much sleep you need, show your upcoming alarm, and list out tomorrow's weather forecast, calendar events, and suggested workout.</p><p>Garmin Triathlon Coach joins the Run, Swim, and Strength Coach options. All these training plans auto-update based on your current performance and fatigue levels, but the newest Coach will include Swim workouts, Two-a-Days, Brick workouts, and optional Strength training.</p><p>If you're following a course, Garmin will trigger the auto-lap mile times when you cross the course markers, rather than when your GPS <em>says</em> you've run a mile. And if you forget to stop your workout at the finish line, Garmin will "suggest trimming data" to match the course. Basically, Garmin will reward people who download GPX data beforehand with common-sense edits.</p><p>Lastly, the Forerunner 570 adds a dozen or so golfing features like yardage to green and a digital scorecard, plus a few new sports modes like Duathlon, Obstacle Racing, Hunting, and Fishing. The 570 ships in Slate Grey, Indigo, Amp Yellow, Cloud Blue, and Raspberry, and is available to order on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1464001/">Garmin's site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-forerunner-970-key-changes-and-upgrades-2">Garmin Forerunner 970: Key changes and upgrades</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-lineup" alt="The three Garmin Forerunner 970 models rendered in white space in a line, showing a watch face, Running Economy widget, and a map view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H7eBpoMwMcMJ4UZMFPke4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Garmin Forerunner 970 has a dozen or so price-locked software tools over the Forerunner 570, most notably preloaded road, trail, ski, and golf maps with 4X the storage. Just like with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a>, it's pretty disappointing that a $549 watch doesn't have offline maps, forcing you to spend $749 to get them!</p><p>The Forerunner 970 also has exclusive access to Strava and Garmin Live Segments, real-time stamina, Hill & Endurance Scores, Group LiveTrack, Trendline popularity routing, advanced cycling dynamics with grit and flow, and ClimbPro.</p><p>What's new compared to the Forerunner 965? The built-in LED flashlight, mic & speaker, sapphire crystal display protection, and support for the ECG app and skin temperature readings give the Forerunner 970 most of the $1,100 Fenix 8's headliner features, which is how you could convince yourself that $749 is actually a fair price.</p><p>I'd also hoped to see cellular support on the Forerunner 970, given the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/garmin-fenix-8-could-get-a-massive-upgrade-in-the-form-of-lte">Fenix 8 LTE leak</a>. Unfortunately, you'll still need your phone on hand for phone calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-preloaded-maps" alt="Render of the Garmin Forerunner 970 in a black void, the image focused on turn-by-turn navigation on a city-streets map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4kBjSXpTAXmxiNoq3uMptD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 970 lasts 15 days or 21 multi-band GPS hours, while the Forerunner 265 lasted 23 days but only 19 multi-band GPS hours. It's 3g heavier than the Forerunner 965, but also 0.3mm thinner. At 56g, it's significantly lighter than a Fenix 8 because only its bezel is titanium, not the entire body.</p><p>While you might resent losing a week of battery life, the Forerunner 970 has the same doubled brightness for enhanced visibility. And the addition of ECGs and skin temp readings, plus the gen5 optical heart rate sensors, will help the 970 deliver more accurate results than the already-reliable 965.</p><p>Otherwise, there are very few software differences between the 970 and 965, aside from new advanced running dynamics tools: Running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss.</p><p>Running tolerance "better understands the impact each run has on the body," with a "recommended weekly maximum mileage" to warn you off of overtraining. Running economy focuses on your "overall energy efficiency," while step speed loss calculates "how much an athlete slows down when their foot hits the ground." But since the latter two require buying and wearing the new $169 HRM 600 chest strap, only running tolerance is built into the Forerunner 970.</p><p>The Forerunner 970 ships in Carbon Grey DLC, Titanium, and Soft Gold in one 47mm size and is available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1462801/">Garmin's site</a>. It ships on May 21.</p>

<p>With a starting price of $699.99, the standard Motorola Razr (2025) features a 6.9-inch AMOLED folding display with a 3.6-inch cover display, while under the hood you&apos;ll get an efficient MediaTek Dimensity 7400X processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery that should easily clear a full day on a single charge. If you want a powerful foldable that won&apos;t break the bank, the base model Razr (2025) is the flip phone for you.  </p>

<hr>
<p>Google is spotlighting how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">Chromebooks</a> are helping students with disabilities thrive in observance of the Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/global-accessibility-awareness-day-2025" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Tricia Davis-Muffett, a senior director at Google for Education, shared how Google's approach to accessibility on Chromebooks is making education more inclusive.</p><p>Some students can’t use a mouse or keyboard easily, Davis-Muffett noted. This is where Chromebook's Face Control steps in, literally letting students navigate their devices with facial gestures such as head tilts and eyebrow raises instead of mouse clicks.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-are-getting-new-real-time-controls-and-engagement-tools-for-educators">rolled out this feature in January with ChromeOS 132</a>, and it’s based on Android’s Project Gameface.</p><p>On top of this feature, the tech giant announced today that ChromeVox, the built-in screen reader for Chromebooks, is getting a nifty upgrade. Soon, when connected to a braille display, it’ll convert audio captions into braille.</p>
<h2 id="braille-gets-a-boost-2">Braille gets a boost</h2>
<p>That means students with visual impairments can independently read what’s on screen without waiting for anyone else to catch them up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6" name="Acer Chromebook" alt="Acer Chromebook on table open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TSD4KZf9cfEpXer2LeDcQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeVox, Google's built-in screen reader, was introduced in Chrome OS version 56.</p><p>Furthermore, for visually impaired students (and keyboard power users), Caret Browsing lets them move through a webpage using only their keyboard. It drops a blinking cursor on the page, like in a Word document, and it’s all arrow keys and tab navigation from there.</p><p>Google also highlights Chrome’s Reading Mode, touting that it now offers a “read aloud” feature with natural-sounding voices. This feature is particularly beneficial for students who struggle with dyslexia or other reading challenges. And because it's baked right into Chromebooks, there’s no need for third-party software.</p>
<h2 id="standardized-test-friendly-2">Standardized test-friendly</h2>
<p>If you're taking the SAT or AP exams on a Chromebook, the College Board’s Bluebook app now works hand-in-hand with ChromeOS accessibility features like Dictation and ChromeVox. This eliminates the need for separate testing accommodations.</p><p>The best part is that these tools aren’t tucked away or hidden behind premium paywalls since they're baked into Chromebooks and ready to go from the first login. Google also highlights how partner apps from the Google for Education App Hub are building even more support on top of these features.</p>

<p>Each year, Google announces a slew a features for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) and this year isn't any different. Today (May 15), Google announced that it is rolling out new updates to its products across Android and Chrome, and adding new resources for developers who building speech recognition tools.</p><p>Google is highlighting how it's integrating Gemini and AI into its accessibility features to improve usability for users with low vision or hearing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM" name="Gemini-Talkback-Option-" alt="Google brings Gemini powered updates for GAAD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RuJqNR2xctHijghSTEQkqM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expanding its existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-google-talk-back">TalkBack</a> option with the ability for people to ask questions and get responses related to the image that they were sent or are viewing. That means the next time a friend texts you a photo of their new guitar, users can get a description of the image and ask follow-up questions about the make and color, or even what else is in the image.</p><p>Taking it a step further with AI, Google says users can not only get descriptions of the image, but also the entire screen they're viewing. For instance, "if you’re shopping for the latest sales on your favorite shopping app, you can ask Gemini about the material of an item or if a discount is available," the tech giant explained.</p>
<p>Google is launching a much-needed feature called Expressive Captions, which helps the listener gauge the mood and emotion of the video. The tech giant states that phones will be able to provide real-time captions for anything with sound across apps.</p><p>It uses AI to not only capture what someone says, but more importantly, how they say it. For instance, if you're watching an intense game and the commentator is calling out an “amaaazing shot,” or when the video message is not “no” but a “nooooo.”</p><p>This AI-powered feature will be able to identify sounds that are dragging out words, to give you accurate captions. It can also spot when people are whistling or clearing their throats, making captions less redundant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY" name="Google-GAAD-Expressive-captions" alt="Expressive captions on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A52PBxHoDFapUruAtyZvUY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new version of Expressive Captions is rolling out in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia for devices running Android 15 and above.</p><p>Lastly, Google is taking steps to continue to make its digital platform more accessible and inclusive. It is giving developers access to its open-source repository from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition/"> Project Euphonia</a> (How AI improves products for people with impaired speech).</p><p>By opening up its resources, developers around the world will be able to personalize audio tools for research ,which could help train their models for diverse speech patterns, Google explained.</p>

<ul><li>The Honor 400 series will feature a new Google Cloud-powered AI tool that converts static images into five-second videos.</li><li>Alongside the new feature, Honor 400 users will also be offered creative control tools without needing to rely on third-party apps.</li><li>While Honor 400 users will reportedly have free access with limitations for the first two months, a subscription from Google will eventually be required to continue using the feature.</li></ul>

<p>Honor 400 series is gearing up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-launching-globally-may-22">launch next week</a>, and ahead of its release, the company already has some exciting AI news about the upcoming devices to share.</p><p>The devices are said to be debuting with a Google Cloud-powered AI image-to-video feature that allows users to transform static images like their personal photos into AI-generated artwork into a five-second video, which for some reason is believed to be shareable on social media.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.94%;"><img id="Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo-1" alt="Honor AI image to video feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z23MAUhQFU8dDFUbog2pAf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="281" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upcoming Honor 400 models are already touted to have flagship-level AI capabilities, alongside having the best AI camera phone in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> segment. Users are further expected to get creative control without relying on third-party apps. The demos of the newly announced AI feature also appear promising, as Honor has shared some videos (converted to GIFs, and the quality might be affected) of the same.</p><p>The static images here include Lady with an Ermine, a self-portrait of Van Gogh, Las Meninas, a sunrise impression, and The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs painting by Georges de La Tou. Converting such static images and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubMmbFvCf5Q">actual photos of people</a> into video clips certainly looks impressive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY" name="Honor-AI-image-to-video-demo" alt="Honor AI image to video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YH3A2XkQvDUNFoPFN2kPWY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Honor 400 series will have a real advantage, we would definitely be seeing it in other Android handsets soon since it is based on Google Cloud, the search giant’s Veo 2 model, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664812/google-honor-ai-image-to-video-gemini">The Verge</a>, and it is already available on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> subscription — however, it is currently based on text input and not image-to-video as seen in the upcoming Honor 400 series. The latter is still available in Google Cloud, and the search giant is charging 50 cents per second of output — and also available only for “approved users.”</p><p>And there’s yet another catch as well, per the publication, the AI image-to-video will be free for Honor 400 users for the first two months, and a limit of only ten videos per day. Honor’s U.K. marketing director, Chris Langley, has further confirmed to The Verge that the feature to stay active would “eventually require some subscription” from Google.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the company is gearing up to launch the Honor 400 and the Honor 400 Pro on May 22. It is a global launch happening in London, and both are believed to have a 200MP primary lens.</p>

The tablet can also be paired with Huawei’s Glide keyboard, which boasts typing convenience. It also features a charging compartment to store the stylus.</p>

The FreeBuds 6, on the other hand, are available at £139.99, and the MatePad Pro pricing is yet to be determined. These products, however, are very unlikely to make their way to the U.S. market since it’s Huawei.</p>

We have our review out, and it's clear Motorola set out to create one of the best flip phones. In fact, dare we argue that it could be one of the best phones of 2025?</p><p>Our Managing Editor Derrek Lee took the time and effort to test the phone, so make sure you check his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 review</a>.</p><p>We share the best Motorola Razr 2025 deals, compare our findings with other Moto reviews, and break down the most important Motorola facts to know before you buy one!</p><p>We'll also share all of the relevant and related articles for the phone so that you don't have to go anywhere.</p>

<p>Motorola's latest foldable phones have arrived, headlined by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review#section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-and-performance">Moto Razr Ultra</a>. This is a true flagship in every sense of the word, as we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the helm, paired with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p><p>Of course, the star of the show is the 7-inch foldable pOLED display, with its 165Hz refresh rate and ability to reach up to 4,500 nits of peak brightness. But that's not all, as the 4.5-inch pOLED cover screen gets even better with the ability to add app shortcuts, along with panels for different apps and widgets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SFZpUvMcbQHbE5UYhd4cqA" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-28" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 on table next to a plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFZpUvMcbQHbE5UYhd4cqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, has been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review#section-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-and-performance">Razr Ultra</a> for the past week, and so far, he seems to be enjoying it quite a bit. Starting off with the design, Derrek points out that Motorola has been able to retain its "unique styling with vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood finishes."</p><p>Those finishes paired with the brushed metal frame look simply stunning, and are frankly, sorely needed in a sea of phones plagued by a lack of imagination. It's very reminiscent of the old Moto Maker days, I just kind of wish we could mix and match or have some type of control over the combinations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-24" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to a small vase with a plant inside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3995" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that came as a surprise when reading Derrek's review was that Motorola has included "Flicker prevention for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>." This is something that our colleague Nick Sutrich has to contend with when using different phones, with some being better than others. I'd really be interested to see how Nick would fare with using the Razr Ultra, but I also know he's more than happy with the OnePlus 13.</p><p>By all accounts, the pOLED displays that Motorola is using for the Razr Ultra look beautiful, and I was even surprised to see that the main screen offers a 165Hz refresh rate. It really seems like Motorola is taking the fight to Samsung, as we suspect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be hitting the market sometime in the next few months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-26" alt="Moto AI options on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqRYFdM42GqzZDdcjwbkrB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wouldn't be a new phone launch in 2025 if AI weren't involved in some form, and that remains true with the Razr Ultra. Motorola introduced quite a few improvements to its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, such as "Look & Talk." This allows you to simply start interacting with Moto AI whenever the Ultra is in "Tent or Stand mode," as you just have to "look at it, and begin listening to you."</p><p>Unlike what we've seen from the most recent crop of Galaxy phones, AI implementation on the Razr Ultra takes a different approach. While we have Moto AI and Google Gemini, Motorola is also making other AI services available, such as Meta AI, Copilot, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">Perplexity</a>. Of those three, Motorola is putting Perplexity first, as you'll get a free Perplexity Pro trial with every purchase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wEBmW5iMfKgcFoMC2RAEUC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-18" alt="Image Studio on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wEBmW5iMfKgcFoMC2RAEUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI fun doesn't stop there, however, as features such as Image Studio and Playlist Studio are offered as a way to let your imagination run wild with the help of AI. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/667277/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review-battery-screen">The Verge</a>, other AI-powered features are also onboard, such as "Remember This" which saves "screenshots, text, and photos so you can ask about them later." It sounds a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> app, without being limited to <em>just</em> screenshots.</p><p>However, The Verge goes on to say that it's not quite "as useful in a personal assistant," with Moto AI being "a little slow to respond to a query since part of it runs in the cloud." One can only hope that this is just a case of growing pains, and that the speed and performance will improve as more people begin using these features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iHoSFECxE5fL6jZuxa6WnD" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-3" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHoSFECxE5fL6jZuxa6WnD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area of concern that some might have is the camera system that Motorola employs. Although previous iterations haven't been terrible, they also haven't quite matched up to the rest of the competition. Seeing as the Razr Ultra is a flagship device, Motorola turned things up a notch, as evidenced by its "collaboration" with Pantone.</p><p>As a reminder, the Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with two rear cameras, utilizing a 50MP main lens and a 50MP ultrawide sensor. Derrek points out that the colors from pictures taken with the main lens "feel much punchier," which they attribute to the aforementioned Pantone collaboration.</p><p>This sentiment regarding the main camera is largely echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Max Buondonno of The Shortcut</a>, as he says "The result is photos that look more true to life than any other Razr in the past."</p>

<p>But what if you don't need the most powerful Moto Razr? Well, there are some deals out there for you too, such as getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-razrplus-2025.html">Razr+ 2025 for $8.99 per month from AT&T</a>, while Total Wireless by Verizon is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.totalwireless.com/smartphones/moto-razr-5g-2025-prepaid">giving away the regular Moto Razr 2025 for free</a> when you transfer your number from your current carrier.

<p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip</a> might be more mainstream, we really have Motorola to thank for making the cover screen actually usable. The Razr Plus 2024 made it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">use any app that you wanted</a>, and the Razr Ultra 2025 takes things further by letting you set up multiple pages full of apps, widgets, and other various shortcuts.</p><p>Derrek says this "remains one of my favorite ways to use the Razr." Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-motorola-razr-ultra-its-good-but-flipping-expensive/">Patrick Holland of CNET</a> exclaims they "feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed."</p><p>The lack of a useful cover screen was one of the reasons why I ended up gravitating back to book-style foldable phones. But after reading Derrek's review and seeing what others have said, I <em>might</em> just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/i-want-motorola-to-make-a-galaxy-z-fold-competitor-but-the-razr-ultra-is-still-tempting">find a way</a> to take the Razr Ultra 2025 for a spin myself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hmTcExnsuRT8CCZsbLP4zD" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-38" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with mulch covering the bottom half" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmTcExnsuRT8CCZsbLP4zD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area of concern for anyone considering a foldable phone is durability. There are plenty of horror stories about someone waking up and opening their phone, only to be greeted with a broken screen. For the most part, it seems those days are largely behind us, as the hardware has been improved.</p><p>However, another aspect of that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">water and dust resistance</a>, with many foldable phones not being able to withstand the elements very well. Thankfully, that shouldn't be too much of an issue with the Razr Ultra 2025, as it features an IP48 rating.</p><p>The key here is the first digit, with the "4" essentially meaning that the phone is protected from dust wreaking havoc. But we still wouldn't recommend taking this with you to the beach. On the other hand, the "8" signifies that the Razr Ultra 2025 is capable of being submerged in up to almost 5 feet of water (or 1.5 meters), for up to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Battery life is another sore subject for foldable phones, as there's even less room in the chassis compared to standard "slab" phones. The Razr Ultra 2025 performs admirably, as Derrek has had "no complaints with battery life," stating that "You'll get a full day of use" with relative ease.</p><p>Not only that, but Motorola didn't hold back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">charging rates</a>, as the Razr Ultra 2025 enjoys up to 68W speeds when using a cable. Wireless charging also gets a boost, as it tops out at 30W charging speeds, both of which are quite welcome.</p><p>The only "catch" here is that Motorola doesn't include a charger in the box. On the bright side, there is no shortage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">great options</a> out there, and we wouldn't be surprised if you didn't already have one at home.</p>

<p>It can be rather overwhelming if you're trying to decide whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023">worth upgrading</a> to a new phone. Motorola didn't do much to help make things easy with its 2025 lineup, as all three models are great in their own way.</p><p>The only obvious upgrade should be if you already have the Razr Plus 2023, as these new models blow it out of the water. AC Contributor Brady Snyder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">takes a deeper look</a> at making such a decision, providing reasons for upgrading regardless of whether you have an existing Razr or if you might be looking beyond the confines of Samsung's ecosystem.</p>

<p>It's easy to be overwhelmed by notifications these days, as every app is vying for your attention and seems to think a plethora of notifications is the only way to hold it. Motorola thought of this and designed a way to help cut down on the problem by introducing AI-powered notification summaries.</p><p>As you can see from the photo above, Moto AI will give you brief snippets of what's happening in each conversation, complete with quick action buttons that you can tap. Whether this is just marking the message as read and making it go away, or tapping an automatic response to make it seem like you're paying attention, is totally up to you.</p><p>We'll likely see a similar feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-notification-summaries">come to Android 16 more widely</a>, but for now, Motorola has the monopoly on the concept on the Android side of things. Apple introduced a similar feature in iOS 18 last year, but it infamously does a terrible job of summarizing things. Whether Moto AI does any better of a job for you is probably up in the air, but it's been a cool feature to play around with so far, nonetheless.</p>

<p>While we're on the subject of Moto AI, let's talk about the new AI-generated content the Razr Ultra 2025 allows you to make. Playlist Studio is easily one of the more creative AI-generated features we've seen on any phone, as it lets you ask for a playlist based on basically anything.</p><p>Android Authority's Ryan Haines asked for something as ridiculous as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-playlist-studio-3548715/">Y2K pizza party jams</a>" and Moto AI spit out a playlist with artists like Nelly, Beyonce, and several others that fit the bill for the era.</p><p>Playlist Studio currently uses Amazon Music as the backend for delivering songs, but don't worry, you don't need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Amazon Prime</a> subscription to use it! Just make sure you've got an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/music/free">Amazon Music free account</a> and you're good to go.</p>

<p>Motorola's camera game has improved tenfold over the company's older phones, and a lot of that has to do with the inclusion of smarter software. This year, Motorola is doubling down on the inclusion of AI-powered camera tricks, including its own version of the Google Pixel's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>. Motorola's feature is called Group Shot, and it ensures that everyone's face looks its best when you take a bunch of photos at a time.</p><p>The key here is not only to have everyone together in a photo, but to take a handful of photos each time you open the camera. After that, the back end does most of the work, making suggestions on a new best group photo for you to use.</p><p>Motorola is also improving its motion capture game with a new Action Shot mode that prioritizes moving subjects and does its best to ensure they're captured without blur. Your results may vary, but it's a big step in the right direction for a company that has historically struggled with camera quality.</p>

<p>Looking to upgrade to the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025), but aren't sure if you should wait until Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> gets announced? While we can't guarantee Samsung won't make something better, there are a few things to consider.</p><p>Both the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) will most certainly be using the same Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. There won't be a better processor available in 2025, and there's no reason to think Samsung will use something less powerful. But while processing power is the same, Motorola's battery tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/thin-phones-are-cool-but-samsung-isnt-the-right-company-to-make-them-right-now">is much better than Samsung's</a>.</p><p>Not only is the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) battery already good, but it supports 68W wired charging so you can get a quick top-up in a few minutes before you walk out the door. Meanwhile, no rumors point to the possibility that Samsung will offer faster charging on the Flip 7 than it did on the Flip 6. For note, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 charges at a paltry 25W rate, taking well over an hour to fully charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-08" alt="Widgets on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7AZhyMbZz5wwPtP8Sgp4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola's Razr cover screen has always been immensely more useful than Samsung's, and while we haven't seen any leaks or rumors pointing to a change, there's always the chance Samsung listens to user feedback and gives the Z Flip 7's cover screen a full overhaul.</p><p>If it doesn't, though, know that Motorola makes it dead easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">use most apps on the cover screen</a> compared to Samsung's very limited, widget-based cover screen. If you haven't used a flip phone lately, you'll be surprised at how useful the smaller cover screen is and how often you'll end up using it instead of flipping open that big screen.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting hardware choices Motorola made with the Razr Ultra (2025) is the inclusion of an ultrawide-angle camera instead of a telephoto camera on the cover. You might be wondering <em>how</em> such a minimal thing could be interesting, and that answer all lies in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">differences between the three Razr 2025</a> models.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) sports the best camera hardware, as you would expect, with a pair of 50MP sensors on the cover display and one 50MP sensor above the inside display. The base Razr also has a 50MP main camera sensor — albeit with a smaller, less performant sensor — and a 13MP ultrawide sensor. So far, that seems to match expectations, but then we look at the middle child.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus (2025) retains the secondary telephoto lens from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus (2024)</a> instead of opting for a secondary ultrawide lens like the other two models. It's hard to know exactly why Motorola made this choice, but it also complicates the decision to choose between the three models because of the camera differences. Regardless, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra (2025) review</a> points out that the change was a good one, as zoom performance remains solid despite the lack of a telephoto camera.</p>

<p>If you're having a hard time choosing between the Razr Plus (2025) and the Razr Ultra (2025), here are a few things that might make the Ultra worth the extra cost to you.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor inside the Razr Ultra is roughly twice as fast as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 inside the Razr Plus. That's quite literally double the speed for just 30% more money. On top of that, you're getting the best displays on any Motorola phone, double the storage,</p><p>Gorilla Glass Ceramic is also present on the Ultra's cover, while the Plus model features Gorilla Glass Victus. If those names don't mean much to you, know this. Victus was introduced as Corning's strongest glass in 2020, while Ceramic was introduced in March of this year. Ceramic is made to withstand as many as 10 drops in a row from 1 meter high on asphalt, while Victus is only rated for a single drop on concrete from up to 2 meters.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) has a 700mAh larger battery than the Razr Plus (2025). The Ultra sits at 4,700mAh while the Plus sports just a 4,000mAh battery. If we're just going by the math, that means the Razr Ultra should get roughly 15% better battery life than the Plus, on average.</p><p>Let's also not forget that the Razr Ultra (2025) comes in a bevy of colors and materials that you can't get on the other two Razr (2025) models. That includes fan favorites like wood and new choices like Alcantara, all of which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">make the Razr Ultra (2025) a sensory delight</a>.</p>

<p>Motorola really went all out with AI on the Razr Ultra and didn't just partner with Google for Gemini but also with a few other companies to ensure the Razr Ultra has <em>all the AI</em>.</p><p>Ryan Whitwam of Ars Technica <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">writes in his Razr Ultra review</a> that he doesn't like this approach, saying it's too much. "It's hard to say exactly how much AI is worth having on a phone with the rapid pace of change, but Motorola has settled on the wrong amount. To be blunt, there's too much AI."</p><p>I definitely agree that there's a lot going on, and it can be overwhelming if you let it. Fortunately, a lot of the Moto AI triggers, like the power button or floating icon, can be disabled to help simplify things. So, for me, the only way to trigger Moto AI is with the AI Key or with Look & Talk.</p><p>I also feel like Moto AI is much less prevalent throughout the OS than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> on its phones, which is seemingly everywhere you look.</p><p>Still, it would be cool if Motorola gave users more control over their AI experience (i.e., what gets processed locally vs. in the cloud) since we now have so many options.</p>

With specs that rival the Galaxy S25 Ultra, that seems like a fair assessment of the Razr Ultra (I would say so).</p><p>However, he does note that "the biggest miss in this generation of Razr is the lack of notable upgrades on the lower two devices, despite retaining the same price tag." I definitely agree that the Razr Plus 2025 was an interesting choice, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">when you compare it to the Razr Plus 2024</a>, since they're pretty much identical.</p><p>On the other hand, the Razr 2025 does include some notable upgrades worth looking at, especially for a $700 foldable. It has a bigger battery, improved hinge, an upgraded chip, and cameras with true-to-life Pantone Validated color and skin tones for (hopefully) better photos. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> was already a steal, especially when it went on sale, but this year's is also not one to ignore if the Razr Ultra is a little too expensive.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Which Razr 2025 model is right for you</a>?</p>

<p>Motorola always seems to find intuitive ways for users to interact with the unique form factor of clamshell foldables, and that's really what makes the Razr Ultra 2025 special. By far, my favorite way to use flip-style foldables is as a portable camera. On the newer model, you get two rear 50MP sensors on the back and one 50MP selfie camera on the inside. But of course, the Razr Ultra 2025 can use <em>any</em> one of its cameras as a selfie camera.</p><p>That opens up a number of possibilities, like Camcorder Mode, which lets you keep the phone half-opened in your hand — like an old-school camcorder. Both you and the person you're filming will get a handy preview of the video feed utilizing the two displays, and it's a game-changer. Flip phones are all about nostalgia, and Camcorder Mode — also a staple of past Razr flagships — reminds me a lot of my Flip camcorder from way back when.</p><p>There are also a ton of other handy modes and features, like Group Shot for group photos and Action Shot for moving subjects. You can always prop up your Razr as a tripod anywhere, too. The versatility of clamshell foldables, and specifically the upgraded Razr Ultra 2025 camera system, is part of what makes them great.</p>

<p>By now, you probably know that the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is a first-of-its-kind move. But how much does that affect performance? If you're curious, we ran Geekbench 6.4 on the Razr Ultra 2025, Razr 2025, and its closest competitors. Here's how they fared:</p>
<div >

</table>
</div>
<p>What can we learn from these results? The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset in the Razr Ultra 2025 helps the phone perform better, especially in multi-core performance, than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Surprisingly, the last-gen chip in Samsung's foldable doesn't falter, as it beats the Razr Ultra 2025 in single-core performance. But it's hard to understate the massive improvements made to multi-core performance between the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr Ultra 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr 2025's chip upgrade seems to be in name only, as there are no noticeable performance improvements in synthetic tests compared to the prior model.</p>

<p>Reviewers seem to agree that the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an outstanding flip phone, perhaps the best clamshell foldable we've seen commercially available in the U.S. The better question is whether the Razr Ultra 2025 is worth the $1,299 price tag it comes with. While the hardware is certainly there, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a trio of 50MP cameras, and major durability improvements, software is still a concern.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 ships with Android 15, the most current public version of Android. However, Motorola is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">only promising three years of Android OS upgrades</a>. That's way less than the competition, as the cheaper Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is supported for a whopping seven years of Android OS upgrades. Considering the company's less-than-stellar track record with updates, this should give every potential buyer pause before dropping a ton of cash on a Razr Ultra 2025.</p>

<p>The new hinge on the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an underrated upgrade this time around. Motorola, a company relatively new to foldables compared to the likes of Samsung, hasn't always offered an outstanding hinge. My experience with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023's hinge was so disappointing compared to the Samsung ones I was used to that I didn't use the phone nearly as much as I hoped.</p><p>Now, there's a new titanium-reinforced hinge for the Razr 2025 series that addresses nearly all of my concerns with prior models. Our Razr Ultra 2025 reviewer, Derrek Lee, concurs, saying that "opening the phone feels great, thanks to the new titanium-reinforced hinge" and adding that "it’s stronger and makes it easier to open the Razr Ultra with one hand."</p><p>I've been testing the base-model Razr 2025, which also has the brand-new titanium hinge, and agree on all counts. It's satisfying enough to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">base Razr 2025 a key upgrade over my Razr Plus 2023</a>.</p>

The phone is currently the most powerful flip phone on the market, with specs that rival even more traditional premium flagships like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And with a price that matches Samsung’s top-of-the-line model for 2025, Motorola seems to have a lot of confidence in the Razr Ultra 2025 following the line’s success in recent years.</p><p>But is Motorola <em>too </em>confident in the Razr Ultra? Does the company have what it takes to charge Samsung-level prices for a phone? I’ve spent a week with the Razr Ultra 2025, and while my thoughts are <em>mostly</em> final, this is how my time with the phone has been and why I think it deserves your consideration.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed the Razr series for the past few years, then the design of the Razr Ultra 2025 shouldn’t surprise you. It looks nearly identical to its predecessor, which in this case would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, sporting the same curved frame, rounded corners, and massive cover panel. The differences lie in the slightly larger display size, the new materials on the back, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 water and dust resistance</a> for improved durability.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Razr Ultra 2025 color options</a> are quite interesting this year, as Motorola continues to move away from muted shades. I have the Rio Red color on my unit, which incorporates Motorola’s now-standard vegan leather and is admittedly the least interesting Razr Ultra 2025 color. I previously spent some time with the soft Alcantara and the hardy wood finishes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">during my hands-on</a>, and I must say, Motorola has given users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">quite the selection of sensory goodies</a> to choose from.</p><p>I also like that Motorola switched from a glossy frame to brushed metal, as it gives the overall design a rustic sheen.</p>

<p>Opening the phone feels great, thanks to the new titanium-reinforced hinge. It’s stronger and makes it easier to open the Razr Ultra with one hand. It almost springs open with a satisfying click, which sounds about as good as it does when closing the phone.</p><p>When the phone is open, you’re greeted with a 7-inch OLED display that looks much punchier than previous models. This is likely a result of the Pantone collaboration, which aims to provide "authentic and vivid images." The sharper Super HD resolution also makes content look crisper, while the variable 165Hz refresh rate helps make UI elements move with a slick, buttery smoothness.</p>

<p>Motorola gives you three display presets for how it displays colors: Natural, Radiant, and Vivid. I would suggest Radiant, as it splits the diff and gives you a bit more vibrancy without overdoing it. There are also a few settings for eye protection, including Flicker prevention for users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, which is nice to see as Motorola continues improving the overall quality of its displays.</p>

<p>Motorola managed to stuff a pretty large 4,700mAh battery into the Razr Ultra 2025, which should help offset the more powerful chipset and higher-resolution display. So far, I have no complaints with battery life, although my usage has been a little skewed as my testing has involved me using the phone more than usual. You’ll get a full day of use, and while I don’t imagine going beyond that, I plan to update this review with my findings as my usage patterns normalize.</p>

<p>Power users will enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-charging-speed">68W charging</a>, which tops up the phone in roughly 40 minutes. Although I haven’t been able to test out the top 30W wireless charging speed, as all of mine top out at 15W, it’s good to see someone in the U.S., aside from OnePlus, moving the needle on charging speeds.</p>

<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and will receive three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which notably falls behind other flagship competitors. The latest version of Hello UX also isn’t much different from Motorola’s Android 14 software, although there are many Motorola or Razr-specific features sprinkled throughout.</p><p>The focus is on AI, and Motorola stuffed as much as it could into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> software, which feels like a much more mature and comprehensive offering than what was offered in last year's beta, with more easily accessible features that you can find in the dedicated Moto AI app. For example, notification summaries are available with the click of a button and are now actionable, and Moto AI will pull up contextual actions based on whatever’s on your screen when you trigger it, similar in a way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p>Image Studio and Playlist Studio are fun ways to use AI to generate images and context-based music playlists (a feature YouTube Music should steal), although the latter is currently limited to Amazon Music, which I imagine won't do many people much good.</p><p>The Razr still features Gemini and some Google AI features to complement Moto AI. And unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Moto AI isn’t injected into <em>every</em> aspect of the OS, which some may find refreshing. That said, there are many ways to trigger it, from the new dedicated AI button to double-tapping the back of the phone.</p>

<p>One of the coolest ways to trigger Moto AI is with Look & Talk. If the Razr Ultra 2025 is in Tent or Stand mode, all you have to do is look at it, and it will begin listening to you. You can also ask follow-up questions, but you’ll have to wait until it’s done speaking or press the mic icon to interrupt it. It’s not as seamless as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>, which will let you interrupt it mid-sentence, and I hope Motorola will enable this in future updates.</p>

<p>Motorola partnered with as many companies as possible to give Moto AI on the Razr Ultra a unique edge, although I think the execution could use some work. For instance, you can ask Moto AI a question and then tap “Explore with Perplexity,” which is a nice way to get users to dive deeper into a topic, but I rarely found myself doing this.</p><p>I would like to see this type of visibility extended to other AI agents that consumers are likely more familiar with, such as Copilot, Meta AI, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. You can always <em>tell </em>Moto AI to “Ask Copilot” or the like, but I would be more inclined to press a button to “Explore with Gemini” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">than I would with Perplexity</a>, even if Motorola is throwing in a free Perplexity Pro trial. This would also just be a good way to visually show consumers that they have options aside from Perplexity.</p>

<hr>
<p>The cover screen experience hasn’t changed much from the Razr Plus 2024, which is great. In fact, it got better with Android 15. Not only can you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">natively use apps on the cover screen</a>, but you can also press and hold for additional actions, and now even set shortcuts to certain app functions on the app panel for even faster access to things without opening the phone.</p>

<p>You can also set multiple app and widget panels, which can come in handy if you want separate app pages instead of scrolling through a single panel. That said, the overall functionality of using apps on the cover screen is still the same and remains one of my favorite ways to use the Razr.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Images are punchy and detailed, with better low-light performance.</strong></li><li><strong>There are plenty of AI features to give users more control over how images are captured and how color is processed.</strong></li></ul>
<hr>
<p>I plan to dive deeper into the cameras in a separate camera review, but for now, I can say that I’m pretty pleased with Motorola's improvements here. I much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">prefer the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor over the 2x telephoto sensor</a> on last year’s Razr Plus. This way, Motorola can have the best of both by utilizing the primary camera for some in-sensor zoom and an ultrawide sensor for group photos and macro shots.</p><p>Lo and behold, the Razr Ultra 2025 takes great photos from the primary sensor, even at 2x zoom. The colors feel much punchier than I’m used to seeing from Motorola, which is likely a product of the Pantone collaboration. Dynamic range also feels improved, with better handling of low-light and nighttime images. The result is images that feel more Samsung in terms of color and saturation, while the added depth and definition remind me a bit of a Pixel.</p><p>I wouldn’t say image quality is anywhere near the impressive quality of the cameras on OPPO, OnePlus, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo</a> phones, but so far, I feel pretty confident that the Razr Ultra 2025 can compete fairly comfortably among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android cameras</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm's latest midrange chip, the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, is here with improved AI and processing capabilities.</li><li>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform is a 4nm processor with the latest connectivity specifications, like Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0.</li><li>This processor will first launch on phones from Honor and Vivo this month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is upgrading its midrange chip offerings with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, a processor with improved AI performance, better image-signal processing, and support for newer connectivity standards. The chipset will first launch in Honor and Vivo midrangers expected to be announced this month, Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-7-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-7-gen-4-mobile-platform" target="_blank">announced</a> in a press release today, May 15.</p><p>The last refresh of the Snapdragon 7 series arrived with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, announced in November 2023. That's the processor the new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 replaces, and the time between releases allowed Qualcomm to deliver a handful of key improvements. Compared to the prior generation, the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 performs 27% better in CPU performance, 30% better in GPU performance, and 65% better in AI performance.</p><p>The Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform uses the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU with dedicated NPUs for audio and sensors. The drastically improved AI performance utilizes the Qualcomm AI Engine for on-device processing, with deep integration throughout the system-on-a-chip. That includes everything from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound">Snapdragon Sound</a> audio to image-signal processing. On top of that, the chip adds Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) support for audio listening for the first time.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is still using a 4nm fabrication process for the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4, the same as the prior generation. However, the newer chipset has a revamped configuration, with one Prime core with a faster 2.8GHz clock speed, four performance cores clocked at up to 2.4GHz, and three efficiency cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> processor, the latest version has a higher-clocked Prime core and an extra performance, with one fewer efficiency core.</p><p>Rounding out the chip's upgrades are connectivity improvements across the board, with 3GPP Release 17 5G support, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6.0 support</a>. That can result in peak W-Fi speeds of up to 5.8 Gbps, up from 2.9 Gbps on the Wi-Fi 6E-only Snapdragon 7 Gen 3.</p><p>Qualcomm's partner OEMs praised the new chipset in a press release, teasing the upcoming products that the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip will power.</p><p>"This powerful platform will enable us to deliver unparalleled performance and cutting-edge features, elevating our users’ mobile experiences in their daily lives," said Fei Fang, who is the president of products at Honor. "We are excited to collaborate closely with Qualcomm Technologies and integrate the new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 mobile platform into our upcoming commercial device."</p><p>Unconfirmed leaks have claimed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/the-honor-400-lite-5g-is-iphone-copying-gone-too-far">Honor 400</a> and the Vivo S30 could be the first phones to sport Qualcomm's new midrange mobile platform.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>RayNeo is carving out a niche on the back of budget-focused XR glasses; I used the Air 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rayneo-air-2s-xr-smart-glasses-review">Air 2S</a> quite a bit in the last year, and with the Air 3S, the brand is aiming to solidify its position in this category. The Air 3S provide a 201-inch micro-OLED panel that you can take anywhere, and they have much better sound than previous models.</p><p>While fringing was an issue in the past, RayNeo made considerable progress in this area, and it wasn't as big a problem on the Air 3S. The glasses are lighter as well, and they get 3840Hz DC dimming along with a new image engine with better colors. The glasses connect to just about any USB-C device, and I didn't see any issues using it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and Steam Deck.</p><p>The best part is the value; these glasses undercut their rivals considerably, and if you're interested in XR glasses to deliver better immersion while gaming or watching movies, the Air 3S are a great starting point.</p>

<p>RayNeo launched the Air 3S on March 15, 2025, and the XR glasses are now available globally. They retail <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/2025-New-RayNeo-Air-Glasses/dp/B0DZ2RQSC5">for just $239 on Amazon</a> as of writing (including a $30 code), and the standard package includes the glasses and a carrying case.</p><p>RayNeo also sells a bundle that includes its Pocket TV accessory, and it's basically a portable Google TV device with a built-in battery that lets you view content without your phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Glasses-Pocket-Bundle/dp/B0F3D13XCY">bundle comes out to $322</a>, and I recommend getting it if you intend to primarily stream TV shows and movies with the device.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rayneo-air-3s-design"><span>RayNeo Air 3S: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ex9gpGjyEPHYvpF7FjzRqK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ex9gpGjyEPHYvpF7FjzRqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo retained the same overall design for the Air 3S, but the glasses now get a silver frame that looks much better. They're made out of plastic, and going this route allowed RayNeo to save weight, with the glasses coming in at just 76g. That's a smidgen lighter than the Air 2S (78g), and the lightweight frame is comfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roTgjCpjD6v655KCSB9RaK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roTgjCpjD6v655KCSB9RaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good weight balance, and you get decent adjustability with three angles to select from. That said, it takes a little bit of work to get a comfortable fit; I had to adjust the nose bridge and the positioning of the frame several times before I was able to use these glasses for any extended amount of time, and even then, they didn't quite fit right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MNgy5DcwBuQEnoivdibbbK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNgy5DcwBuQEnoivdibbbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glasses don't exert too much pressure on the nose or ears — RayNeo did a decent job distributing the weight of the glasses evenly across the body. However, the design and sizing of the glasses can lead to fatigue with extended use; my colleague Nick Sutrich also tested the Air 3S, and he wasn't able to get a comfortable fit, leading to strain with just 30 minutes of usage.</p><p>So if you've got your eye on these, I highly recommend trying out the glasses to see if you can get a good fit, as that makes all the difference.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qgyYTybazSrFrC6dR4rJZK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qgyYTybazSrFrC6dR4rJZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Air 3S retains the same control mechanism as the Air 2 and 2S; you get a brightness slider on the right, and the menu button and volume key on the left. The menu lets you switch between 60Hz and 120Hz, and there are four picture modes available: Standard, Game, Movie, and Eye Protection. I found the Movie mode to deliver the best color fidelity, and the Eye Protection mode switches to a warmer profile.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WWuFH7GE3LAN8LVhJcqhbK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWuFH7GE3LAN8LVhJcqhbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inclusion of 3840Hz DC dimming means you don't have to deal with flicker, and that's a notable differentiator on these glasses. Another advantage is the sound; thanks to a quartet of audio drivers, the Air 3S produces immersive sound that gets astonishingly loud. There's also a quiet mode that prevents sound leakage, and it is pretty nifty if you're using these glasses outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uvY5vLKzofeYcnQrtauGpK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvY5vLKzofeYcnQrtauGpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the front shade of the glasses is darkened, but it doesn't block out the world; if you're outdoors or in a room with a lot of ambient light, you will notice light leakage through the glasses. Other brands use electrochromic lenses that let you adjust the level of darkness, but as the Air 3S is aimed at the budget segment, it misses out on this mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EFL2txmzBjsrRCz5MZ92pK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EFL2txmzBjsrRCz5MZ92pK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo bundles a hard shell case with the Air 3S, and it has a mesh pocket that holds the provided USB-C cable. Connecting the glasses to a USB-C device is as straightforward as it gets; just plug in the angled end of the USB-C cable to the Air 3S, and the other side to the source device. I used the glasses predominantly with my Steam Deck, but I didn't see any issues connecting to my Vivo X200 Pro or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L6Dd9vQdjN2zNvgkCvqDdK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L6Dd9vQdjN2zNvgkCvqDdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it misses out on some of the extras you get with AR glasses, the Air 3S is a terrific choice if you're looking to play games or stream content. The 201-inch micro-OLED panel has vibrant colors, and it gets very bright. RayNeo is using a new image engine, and there's a noticeable difference in color balance against the Air 2S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glasses truly shine when gaming; playing Hades while connected to the Steam Deck was thoroughly enjoyable, and the ease of use is a definite plus point. The onboard sound is detailed, and while my usage of XR glasses is limited to RayNeo's products, the Air 3S sounds better than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Xreal's One smart glasses are the standard in this category, and they have an elegant design with a better panel. They don't look quite as outlandish as the Air 3S, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65">coming in at $499</a>, they cost twice as much.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want XR glasses that are a good value</li><li>You need a high-quality panel</li><li>You want good color vibrancy and eye comfort features</li><li>You need XR glasses with good built-in sound</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best comfort</li></ul>
<p>RayNeo understands this market well, and by selling the Air 3S at just $239, it is effectively undercutting every other brand. The XR glasses excel at the basics; you get a bright 201-inch projection with great colors and contrast, useful eye protection features, and detailed sound.</p><p>The fit is problematic, and using the glasses outdoors is a bit of a hassle as you don't get a fully tinted shade, but the pros significantly outweigh the cons. These glasses are particularly great if you're looking to play on the Steam Deck or Switch while on the go, and they're just as versatile with multimedia content.</p><p>Ultimately, it's the value that gives the Air 3S a definite edge; they're affordable enough that you can easily try out the glasses and see if they hold up to your intended use case.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>WiiM delivered a standout product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wiim-amp-review">Amp</a>, and it followed that up with the Ultra and the Amp Pro. Now, it's bringing both features together into the Amp Ultra, delivering the best features of the Ultra alongside amplification. The Amp Ultra provides 100W to each channel into 8 ohms, and 200W a channel at 4 ohms thanks to the use of two TI TPA3255 Class-D amp chips and six TI OPA1612 op-amps.</p><p>WiiM retained a similar design as the Ultra, and the aluminum housing along with the sleek chassis make it look as elegant as Apple's high-end products. Connectivity includes HDMI ARC, USB-A to connect drives, optical, RCA, and subwoofer out. The DAC is an ESS ES9039Q2M, and it has 384kHz/32-bit decode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.50%;"><img id="7oW8zeyouga8L3kJPeHhG3" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oW8zeyouga8L3kJPeHhG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1239" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WiiM)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Amp Ultra has a 3.5-inch screen that lets you control the device, and it has most major music streaming protocols, including Spotify Connect, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Alexa, DLNA, and Roon. What's interesting is that you also get automatic room correction, and I'm intrigued in seeing how it holds up.</p>
<p>WiiM also showcased the Sound, a smart speaker that's touted with "exceptional audio fidelity" and all the smarts that are standard in WiiM's other products. WiiM is positioning multi-room audio and high-res listening as a differentiator, and it's clear to see that the brand is going after Sonos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="cTUdGGHrbQuQTRxje7DfK3" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTUdGGHrbQuQTRxje7DfK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WiiM)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Sound provides 100W of power via a 4-inch sub and dual tweeters, and it also gets room correction along with stereo pairing. It has Google Assistant (soon to be Gemini) integration as well as Alexa, and includes Spotify Connect, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, and DLNA.</p>
<p>That's not all; WiiM is also debuting a subwoofer dubbed the Sub Pro. It delivers 250W of power via an 8-inch driver, and seamlessly integrates with the rest of the brand's products. It has a sleeker design than most subwoofers around, and it has RCA if you're connecting it to your existing audio system.</p><p>The only drawback is that we'll need to wait until Q3 to know what the Amp Ultra, Sound, and Sub Pro will cost. I've enjoyed using the WiiM Amp and Pro Plus quite a bit, and I'm excited to see what these products have to offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Max is ditching the “Max” name and going back to HBO Max this summer—less than two years after switching it up.</li><li>This will be the second time the service has changed its name in just three years—first launched as HBO Max in 2020, replacing HBO Now and separate from HBO Go.</li><li>The company is focusing on high-quality TV over a massive library.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced that Max is getting its old name back. The streaming service is heading back to being called HBO Max, like it never left.</p><p>Just two years after ditching the HBO Max name, it’s coming back. At Wednesday’s Upfront event, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the switch will happen this summer.</p><p>The upcoming name change marks the platform's second identity crisis in just three years. Back in May 2020, when it was still under WarnerMedia, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming service</a> launched as HBO Max, replacing HBO Now (its standalone streaming option since 2014) while keeping it separate from HBO Go (its old cable-authenticated VOD service that's since been retired).</p>
<h2 id="more-content-wasn-t-the-answer-2">"More content" wasn’t the answer</h2>
<p>At launch, WarnerMedia promised HBO Max would deliver everything HBO has to offer and then some.</p><p>HBO Max also packed in content from the rest of WarnerMedia’s lineup, including DC Comics, Cartoon Network, and more. Still, the real hook was being able to stream HBO’s top-shelf lineup without needing cable.</p>

<p>When Max <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/hbo-max-is-officially-just-max-what-this-means-for-you">ditched the HBO name in 2023</a>, it left everyone scratching their heads. Suddenly, apps on platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> showed up as just "Max," confusing subscribers who wondered where their HBO content went.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery claimed that the goal was to broaden the brand's appeal beyond just HBO's prestige TV crowd. No more HBO in the name meant the service could push reality shows, kids' content, and blockbuster movies without feeling tied to HBO's highbrow reputation.</p>
<h2 id="a-lesson-in-brand-loyalty-2">A lesson in brand loyalty</h2>
<p>Turns out, viewers weren’t shy about hating the name change. Despite Warner Bros. Discovery’s grand plans, dropping HBO rubbed fans the wrong way, and many saw it as ditching the prestige that made the platform special in the first place.</p><p>Now, the company is course-correcting. Instead of chasing a "quantity over quality" approach with a sprawling library of random content, it's doubling down on high-end, must-watch TV.</p><p>Bringing back the HBO name is a key move in Warner Bros. Discovery’s plan to grow its global subscriber base. The company believes that reintroducing the HBO brand on Max will make it crystal clear to subscribers what kind of high-quality content they can expect.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is detailing an expansion of its experimental card for interested users, which involves a brighter spotlight on your health.</p><p>Detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/See-what-s-new-for-Fitbit-Labs/ba-p/5750673#M318">blog post</a>, Fitbit Labs is introducing three new tests for interested users. The first is called "Medical Record Navigator," which leverages Gemini for "clear health summaries." Fitbit says this feature can turn your "complicated lab reports" into more understandable overviews. Gemini is the key player here, condensing all that information, so you know where you stand.</p><p>Fitbit states it will also link users to "educational resources" about the data returned.</p><p>The post states the Medical Record Navigator will roll into the Labs experience in the mobile app "later this week." Users will be able to sign up/enroll and begin "securely uploading" their lab reports into Fitbit's navigator.</p><p>The second and third tests almost go hand-in-hand, with the first stated to be the "Symptom Checker" experiment. Through this, Fitbit says users can "describe" what they're feeling, like if they're head hurts. The company says the app "may" ask you some follow-up questions to better understand what's wrong.</p><p>The provided answers will be analyzed so the app can deliver potential reasons behind why you feel bad. This test is slated to begin "in the coming weeks."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW" name="google-pixel-watch-3-readiness-score.jpg" alt="Morning Brief Readiness Score on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final upcoming test is "Unusual Trends." This one is more of a background, watchful eye on your health. Fitbit states that once you've enrolled, Unusual Trends will figure out "what's normal for you." After that, it will continue to monitor your health data for changes that could signal something that requires your attention.</p><p>Fitbit says you'll be alerted if your data begins to "trend away from your baseline." The post adds that certain changes could be indicative of sickness or stress. Either way, if something falls out of the norm, you'll (ideally) know about it.</p><p>Like the Symptom Checker, Fitbit Labs' Unusual Trends is set to arrive in the coming weeks.</p><p>Another significant Fitbit Labs addition was introduced in March, as the app gave testers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/fitbit-labs-personal-sleep-schedule-test-reported">the Sleep Schedule experiment</a>. In short, the feature's purpose is to help users get an optimal amount of sleep, especially if you've been feeling tired. Sleep Schedule will feed multiple surveys throughout the day, from morning to afternoon and evening. The surveys will help the app understand what might be impacting your sleep, like noise, light, or perhaps the time you're going to bed.</p><p>As always, users can find current Fitbit Labs tests in the "You" and "Today" tabs. Users can participate or hop onto the waitlist.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-malware-2">What is malware?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="Uf3njLayCGX27JxWv92uhV" name="Android-Malware-1.jpg" alt="Malware" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uf3njLayCGX27JxWv92uhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know it's something bad, but do you really know what malware is? It's probably not exactly what you're thinking.</p><p>Malware is defined as any software designed to disrupt or exploit a device, a network, or data on either. Some shady bootleg app that steals your bank info is malware, but under this definition, so is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-dont-know-what-id-do-without-chromes-autofill-feature">Chrome</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-edge-officially-launches-ios-and-android">Microsoft Edge</a>. You need to go one step further and describe malware as a thing that does this without your permission.</p><p>The easiest way to describe it is with a simple example: a boring flashlight app. You download and install a flashlight app to do only one thing: turn on your camera flash when you tap the icon. To do this, the app only needs access to the basics — an ability to take user input and send a request to toggle the flash on and off.</p><p>Now imagine the same app, but this time it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/problem-android-permissions-too-much-information-and-not-enough-information-all-once">wants to access your contacts</a>. It doesn't offer any sort of community access to your camera flash and doesn't have a reason for doing it. It just does and you have no idea why. That's malware. It's planning on doing something with your data, maybe in the future, but the important thing is that it's trying to do things it doesn't need to do. Substitute any other data for your contacts and the situation is the same.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-malware-spread-2">How does malware spread?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="eMSaRfNunXs6FzUUxTuhoS" name="Android-Malware-4.jpg" alt="Sandboxed permissions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMSaRfNunXs6FzUUxTuhoS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Thankfully, it's very difficult for any application to do what's described above in secret. Unfortunately, it probably doesn't need to be secretive because you never looked to see what else the app tells you it will do down in its fine print.</p><p>One way malware is distributed is by relying on you to accept all the things an app can do without reading anything. However, this method only works for apps that follow the complicated and often silly platform distribution rules. And yes, that flashlight app scenario happened on both Android and iOS, in each official app store; it followed the rules, so it was allowed to at the time.</p><p>Social engineering (getting you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">click yes, knowing you won't read it all</a> is social engineering at the lowest level) is probably the most common way to spread malware. If I can build an app that does things it shouldn't, I still would need a way to have you install it.</p><p>Trickery works because most people don't realize the harm that can arise from their simple actions. You can compromise your information, your friends and family's information, and even the information of other devices using the same network as you. All you have to do is click yes.</p><p>A scarier way of spreading malware is by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">exploiting bugs in your phone's OS</a> and installing software without your knowledge. Maybe you visit the wrong website, try pirating sites for "free" paid apps, or even connect to the wrong open Wi-Fi network. These are ways malware can find its way onto your device.</p><p>Once in place, this sort of malware can cause serious issues. Governments of the world even try it, so it can monitor the people they think need to be monitored because it's powerful and usually undetectable.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-try-and-prevent-all-this-2">What can I do to try and prevent all this?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rqNR9WF3NtKSHhQjGZgYqM" name="OnePlus-9-Google-Play-Store-logo-16x9-hero.JPG" alt="Google Play Store on OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rqNR9WF3NtKSHhQjGZgYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, it's not that difficult to protect yourself. You could install one of the many malware scanners available and hope it catches any and everything, but you also need to follow a few simple rules if you just want things to be easy and malware-free.</p><p><strong>Only use the official app store that came with your phone. </strong>Your phone comes with at least one way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-apps">find and install apps</a> to do fun and cool things with. These stores aren't perfect, but they are a million times better at catching and removing malware before it can get to you than any other distribution model.</p><p>Apple tests every app before it's placed in the store, while Google makes sure the app follows the rules before it's made available, and then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">scans every app</a> before it gets installed on your phone. Samsung, Epic, and other app markets also have safeguards in place to make sure they aren't spreading bad apps.</p><p><strong>Never click yes before you read what you're agreeing to.</strong> This can't be stressed enough! These user agreements are terrible and often full of language designed to give one party an advantage in the case of a dispute, but force yourself to read through them every single time. You might not like your options; you'll either need to agree to the terms presented or not use an app, a service, or even a device itself.</p><p>Nobody wants to put their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> back in the box to send to Samsung because they don't want Samsung to analyze the way they use it, but those are the rules. Once you've said yes, they can and will do what they asked permission to do. Make sure you're OK with it all by reading what is put in front of you.</p><p>(<em>Editor's note: You can trust companies like Samsung, Apple, or even Google to do only what they say they will do with anything they collect from your phone, so don't let that scare you off.</em>)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hq9ezpRjMLcmMnnwm3USyW" name="android-update-google-pixel-generic.jpg" alt="Android System Update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hq9ezpRjMLcmMnnwm3USyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Always accept updates.</strong> When you buy a device, you're given a promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">software support for a specific amount of time</a>. A big part of that support is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here"> patching the bugs and exploits</a> used to hijack your phone or install bad apps without your knowledge. Trust that companies like Google and Apple know what they are doing, but also accept that other smart people are trying to find ways to defeat every protection you have. Exploits will happen, and when those get patched, be sure to install the update right away.</p><p><strong>Never trust anything without verifying it first</strong>. This is the hardest part. Is that message really from your little brother asking for $200, or saying he forgot the gate code, or is it from someone else? Make sure. The same goes for any links you come across — are you sure you can trust them?</p><p>Be very cautious using public Wi-Fi networks, too. It's easy to make one (you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-mvnos-allow-tethering">do it right on your phone</a>!) and with the right tools, everything sent on them can be collected: passwords, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA information</a>, credit card info, etc. Taking a minute to make sure you know the <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> is a lot easier than trying to fix everything after someone steals your identity or your credit card number.</p><p>Really, it's not as hard as it sounds to protect yourself. It's also not foolproof — anyone can end up with malware, even security professionals or government officials with security teams. Doing your part makes it a lot harder.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing's CEO, Carl Pei, confirmed that the Phone 3 is on the way this summer and will cost "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</li><li>Pei highlights the Phone 3's usage of Android, and all of its upgraded features and security enhancements.</li><li>Nothing took a break in 2024, opting to refrain from a Phone 3 launch while it developed its AI software, which we've seen in full on the Phone 3a series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is giving consumers their first major teaser drop about its next flagship phone launch.</p><p>Joining Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNR550z7xXU&ab_channel=Android">Android Show</a>, Nothing's CEO Carl Pei discussed what consumers can expect next: the Phone 3, and when. Pei announced that the Phone 3 will launch this summer. Pei states the company is "going all in" with the device, granting it "premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up."</p><p>More importantly, Pei clued consumers into its price, reportedly "somewhere around" £800 (~$1,062).</p><p>Pei adds that users will be given the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details">secure</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">upgraded Android experience</a> within its upcoming next-generation Nothing phone. The video then dips into Nothing's AI efforts. Pei states the company has worked with its community to create software that's "not just bolted on, but built in."</p><p>The company remains confident that its AI features will work with users, learning and adapting to who they are.</p>

<p>Those waiting on the Phone 3 can breathe easy now, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">2024 came and went</a> without its appearance. That wasn't without reason, as Nothing prioritized developing its planned AI software over the flagship phone. At the time, Pei touted Nothing's AI as "highly personalized and dynamic." We've seen what the company was working on with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">the Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>. Nothing introduced its "Essential Space," a suite of AI features to give users more utility in their daily lives.</p><p>The Essential Key, the series' new physical button, lets users quickly surface its AI features. Pressing that opens up the option to record voice notes or browse through your stored content.</p><p>On a more exciting note, Nothing's direct confirmation (price teaser) of the Phone 3 comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-emoji-teasers-impending-launch">quickly after its emoji teaser</a>. Last week, the company posted two emojis: a smartphone and the number three. We've been expecting the Phone 3 this year ever since the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">said as much in March</a>. The device is speculated to be a "milestone" for the company and will "100%" come to the U.S., per Pei.</p><p>A few rumors claim the device could feature a 6.5-inch display with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC. But we're not far off now from its official arrival, where we'll know all its content for certain.</p>

<ul><li>A research report by BrightEdge states Google's AI Overviews have led to a 49% increase in search impressions.</li><li>The post states users are clicking-through less, likely due to AI Overviews appearing in roughly 11% of Search queries.</li><li>Google's AI Overviews storied history officially began in May 2024, which kicked off its citations update and its trouble with erroneous answers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Research was conducted on the effects Google's AI Overviews have on its Search ecosystem, and the results appear positive.</p><p>In a report by BrightEdge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/14/3080918/0/en/One-Year-Into-Google-AI-Overviews-BrightEdge-Data-Reveals-Google-Search-Usage-Increases-by-49.html">Global Newswire</a>), its research reportedly concludes that Google's AI Overviews are mostly positive for it and the user experience. The founder and CEO of BrightEdge, Jim Yu, said, "The assumption was that AI would kill traditional search." Instead, these bite-sized AI notes have increased search impressions "by over 49%," to which Yu adds, "our data tells a different story: search is not disappearing, it’s expanding. Google is not being replaced; it’s being reimagined.:</p><p>The report breaks things down, stating AI Overviews now appear in "over 11%" of Google Search queries. Moreover, the company finds that users are clicking through results less because of this, with a ~30% decline in such behavior.</p><p>Citing sources is another topic Google has pushed with its AI Overviews, but it's not the only one doing this. As the post highlights, other companies like OpenAI with ChatGPT and Perplexity also deliver an "overview" variant. However, as it notes, each is different, with ChatGPT offering "rare" instances of citations. Perplexity is stated to step this up to roughly five citations per answer, yet it mostly skips out on brand names.</p><p>BrightEdge analysts claim Google sits between its competitors, offering a mix of brand names and citations that (hopefully) make sense.</p>

<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">tested links</a> in AI Overviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-source-linking-generative-ai-search">a couple of different times</a>, as the software is prone to either hallucinating or flat-out getting things wrong. With in-line links, users can see clearly (and faster) where the AI got the information it's reciting. It also helps to retain the AI's credibility and gives users a chance to ensure they're not going around spouting nonsense either. Fact-checking has even hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">the likes of Gemini</a>.</p><p>However, AI Overviews didn't have a flawless first year, as you may remember the whole "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound">glue cheese on pizza</a>" thing. Reports piled in last spring with users showcasing the strange responses Google's AI Overviews provided. The issue prompted the company's Head of Search, Liz Reid, to speak out about them and the cause: "queries that people don’t commonly do"</p><p>Reid explained that when there isn't enough information for the AI to utilize, it creates an information gap. The AI scrambles and often digs up whatever it can to fulfill the query. Unfortunately, the AI dug into troll posts on the internet that were wrong, but it doesn't know that. Reid stated last year that Google would return to the kitchen to alter how the AI interprets "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries.</p><p>Let's not forget that the AI is drawing knowledge from us, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">so stop trolling</a>.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">officially launching</a> in May 2024 during I/O 2024, Google has continued to refine and expand its overviews. Most recently, in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews expanded to Circle to Search</a> for the Galaxy S25 series. These overviews include one-tap actions for users who find phone numbers, emails, and more.</p>

<ul><li>The Suunto Run is a budget AMOLED running watch that only weighs 36g with the strap.</li><li>It has dual-band GPS, an updated HR sensor, music storage, and new training tools like a smarter Track mode and Ghost Running.</li><li>It costs $249 / £199 and ships in four color options, with no subscription cost.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to budget running watches for serious runners, the $249 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> and $229 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> have few rivals. But the new Suunto Run deserves to be in that conversation.</p><p>Announced on Tuesday, the $249 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.suunto.com/products/suunto-run-all-black">Suunto Run</a> has a 12-day battery life, an altimeter, and dual-band GPS that lasts 20 hours, beating the 11-day Forerunner 165 that only offers 17 hours of all-systems GNSS (meaning no dual-band mode).</p><p>While the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a> offered 40 dual-band GPS hours, Suunto has revamped its newer models' GPS and optical HR sensors, so you're ironically paying less for better accuracy with the Run watch.</p><p>Weighing just 36g with its 22mm nylon band, plastic body, and steel bezel, the Suunto Run won't win any beauty pageants but will feel breezy on your wrist during runs. And its 1.32-inch, 466x466 AMOLED display is a visual upgrade on MIP watches like the PACE 3 in this range.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RPi7QyVRyhDjTHqX38uQUV" name="suunto-run-render" alt="Render of the Suunto Run showing different sports modes on the AMOLED display, the steel bezel, and the crown and buttons along the right side of the case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RPi7QyVRyhDjTHqX38uQUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Suunto)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Suunto also cut offline maps, power meter support, and third-party SuuntoPlus apps from the Suunto Run, making the Race or Race S a better fit if you want all the bells and whistles. But breadcrumb navigation without topo maps is much easier to swallow on a $249 watch than on the $499 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Garmin Instinct 3</a>.</p><p>Plus, the Suunto Run adds some unique running tools, starting with a new Track Run mode that will map out and memorize your local track to provide better location accuracy during workouts. The Ghost Runner mode lets you race past times or your friends' times on a certain route, while the marathon widget provides a real-time estimated finish time so you can tweak your pace as you run.</p><p>You can store up to 4GB of music on the Suunto Run, though you'll need your own MP3 files. Most running brands besides Garmin aren't able to support major music apps like Spotify, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The Suunto Run gives runners a 7-day training load widget, your fitness progress (akin to VO2 Max), and a recovery widget that helps guide your future training, though no suggested daily workouts or imported plans. It's best suited for self-guided runners who might pay for TrainingPeaks but don't need their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> to hand-hold them through the workout.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Forerunner 165 does have suggested workouts, Garmin Coach, and recovery data, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-want-to-swap-my-garmin-forerunner-965-for-165-and-why-i-cant">blocks training load</a> to upsell you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>. The COROS PACE 3 does have training load and importable training plans, but a duller screen and fewer dual-band GPS hours.</p><p>We look forward to testing the Suunto Run against these two watches, which showed great accuracy in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap running watch test</a>. But strictly on paper, the Suunto Run sounds like a great deal with only a few compromises that some runners won't live without.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This year's Google I/O show is a little different from the rest. It begins this week with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-android-show-i-o-edition-everything-that-was-announced-from-android-16-to-android-xr">The Android Show</a> and culminates in the usual set of festivities next week, starting Tuesday, May 20. It'll be easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">watch Google I/O 2025</a> from afar, but attendees are getting something special if Android president Sameer Samat has anything to say about it.</p><p>As The Android Show 2025 wrapped up, Samat put on what appeared to be a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">Google and Samsung's upcoming smart glasses</a>, complete with tinted lenses. As Samat put on the glasses, he teased that Google I/O 2025 would be full of more Android announcements, "and maybe even a few more really cool Android demos." Clearly, we're getting an up-close look at Google and Samsung's new smart glasses this year.</p><p>You can see the moment in the video below at the 20:27 timestamp.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3yDd3CmA_Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>My biggest takeaway from this brief moment is that Google looks to be making glasses with different style options, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>. The frames look to be roughly the same size as Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a>, with temple arms slightly thicker than a standard pair of Ray-Bans. I made a quick side-by-side of me wearing the transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses next to Samat wearing the upcoming Google Smart Glasses.</p><p>We most recently saw these glasses at TED 2025, where Google product leads debuted features like live translation, Gemini integration, and the ultra-futuristic memory feature that can remember where you left items, like your keys. Those glasses had transparent lenses, though, while the pair Samat is wearing has full tinting.</p><p>There's no release date for these glasses yet, but they are thought to be made by Samsung and currently called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses" target="_blank">Project HAEAN</a>. They are scheduled to launch later this year alongside Samsung's mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>It's widely expected that Google will deliver substantial info on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the new version of Android meant for smart glasses, VR headsets, and more, at Google I/O 2025. Google initially revealed Android XR back in December <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">at a special event</a>, detailing the basic UI and showing off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> headset for the first time publicly.</p><p>And while the headset itself promises to deliver cutting-edge visuals and a new UI built from the ground up for the Gemini era, it's the smart glasses that many people seem to be most excited about.</p><p>Google Glass debuted well over a decade ago and caught many people's attention, and while that product was well ahead of its time, Google has learned a thing or two about XR since then.</p><p>Google's smart glasses are said to have a small screen in the lens, similar to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses 3</a>. While you can see things on the screen, it's likely that Google wants users to directly interact with the glasses by using Gemini, while Meta is using a hybrid model where Meta AI drives some interaction, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a wearable wristband</a> lets users directly interact with the UI using hand gestures.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> on Tuesday (May 13), and it brings in a host of new features, including enhancements to Find My Device.</p><p>According to Google, the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dont-get-lost-set-find-my-device-soon-you-get-your-phone">Find My Device</a> is seeing an evolution into Find Hub, making the process of locating belongings, family, and friends even easier.</p><p>The search giant will also be bringing new nearby finding capabilities with UWB-enabled tags — and Moto Tag is believed to be the first product to feature the functionality.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/locate-lost-belongings-find-hub/">evolution of Find Hub</a> also comprises the integration of satellite connectivity, which is said to help users stay connected with friends and family even when they aren’t around any cellular connectivity.</p><p>Google is aiming to make traveling even smoother. The company is all set to increase its partnerships with prominent airlines that will allow users to easily share their Bluetooth tag’s location with the airlines in order to recover their lost luggage hassle-free. The suggested partnerships are expected to see the light of day by early next year, which should come in handy for all those travel enthusiasts out there.</p>

<h2 id="part-of-android-16-revamp-2">Part of Android 16 revamp</h2>
<p>Users will also be expecting more personalization options going forward with the Find Hub. It ties in with the customization that is coming to Android 16 with the new Material 3 Expressive introduced by Google on Tuesday (May 13) with an aim to make the usage of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> (with Wear OS) “fluid, personal, and glanceable.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google I/O event, aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">The Android Show</a>, has also focused on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">expansion of Gemini Live</a> across the ecosystem. It means Google Assistant will entirely be replaced by Gemini Live on Android phones, wearables (via Wear OS), cars (through Android Auto), TVs (via Google TV), and XR (Android XR). The suggested integration would further focus on intuitive, hands-free, and context-aware AI assistance presumably superior than Google Assistant.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's limited-edition Galaxy Ring looks fresh with a "Two-Tone Titanium Black" color combo (Titanium Black + Titanium Silver), but the tech inside is the same as previous versions.</li><li>Right now, the ring's only available at that one store, and no word on how many are up for grabs.</li><li>You can snag it at the Samsung Gangnam store, or get it with the S25 Edge for 20% off and KRW 100,000 ($70) in Samsung points.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">pulled back the curtain on the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, but  that wasn’t the only surprise it had up its sleeve. Tucked into the buzz around its South Korean launch was something a little extra for wearable fans: a limited-edition colorway of the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-s25-%ec%97%a3%ec%a7%80-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c" target="_blank">Korean website</a>, the new Galaxy Ring is pretty much the same tech-wise as its past versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-limited-edition-two-tone-color-announced/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). The real standout is its fresh look.</p><p>Samsung calls it "Two-Tone Titanium Black," a smooth mix of the classic Titanium Black and Titanium Silver. There are no photos of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> yet, but it's clear the company is going for a premium vibe here.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-inside-close.jpg" alt="Looking at the electronics on the inside of the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting tomorrow, you can grab this exclusive smart ring at the Samsung Gangnam flagship store, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>While you can buy the ring solo, bundling it with the Edge gets you a sweet 20% discount on the ring and adds KRW 100,000 (approximately $70) worth of Samsung membership points.</p><p>Sadly, this unique ring is only available at one location for now. Samsung hasn’t revealed how many of these limited-edition pieces are up for grabs. Here’s hoping it'll rethink the strategy and make this cool design available to more countries soon.</p>
<h2 id="same-tech-fresh-drip-2">Same tech, fresh drip</h2>
<p>Aside from the fresh look, the limited-edition Galaxy Ring's core design stays the same, meaning no new features to speak of.</p><p>The existing lineup comes in Titanium Silver, Titanium Gold, and Titanium Black, with sizes ranging from 5 to 15. If you’re unsure about your size, Samsung’s got you covered with a free sizing kit when you order.</p>

From epic trade-in opportunities to free storage upgrades and beyond, keep reading for the best ways to save cash on this Samsung phone before it hits store shelves on May 30th. So far, I&apos;ve seen offers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-edge/buy/galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-unlocked-sku-sm-s937uzsexaa/"><strong>$800 off with eligible trade-in at Samsung</strong></a>, or this Verizon deal that gets you the Edge for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/"><strong>FREE if you add a line and trade in an eligible device</strong></a>. Not too shabby for a phone that isn&apos;t even out yet!</p><p>In case you missed the big announcement yesterday, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> boasts most of the same great specs found in the rest of the S25 series — including a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and all the latest AI-boosted software features — and packs them into an unbelievably thin, lightweight device. The only catch is that this lightweight build comes at the expense of battery life. Still, the S25 Edge is destined to earn a place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released this year, and thanks to the following preorder deals, you might get it for pretty cheap too.  </p>

<ul><li>A report claims Meta is pushing ahead with its planned 2026 smart glasses, which could upgrade Live AI to last longer.</li><li>The company is also looking into "super sensing," which is a host of AI features that could include facial recognition software.</li><li>A previous report detailed Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses, which are reportedly preparing to debut in 2025 with a singular display on its right lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New reports claim Meta's next planned pair of smart glasses could take its AI facial recognition to new heights.</p><p>Word about what Meta's next smart glasses could provide stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-renews-work-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-worries-fade">The Information</a>, who state there's a wealth of AI behind the lenses (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/next-gen-ray-ban-meta-2026-super-sensing-facial-recognition-live-ai/">UploadVR</a>). According to the report, Meta is supposedly pursuing an upgraded version of its "Live AI." Per the publication, Live AI is being looked at for Meta's 2026 smart glasses, and is designed to "see what its user does and responds in real-time, for hours."</p><p>This is designed to offer quick, hands-free help for users without needing to call the AI forward with its voice prompt. However, reports add that Meta is also looking into facial recognition software for its next glasses.</p><p>This feature is reportedly under Meta's internal "super sensing" codename. The post cites sources close to the matter who claim the company wants its super-sensing to boost the "popularity" of its products. Here's the thing about super sensing: it would enable the smart glasses to keep their cameras and sensors active at all times.</p><p>What's more, sources allege the AI would "remember" what all it saw (through the user).</p><p>The AI could even recognize certain important items like, say, your car or home keys. If this sounds familiar, it's because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">demoed such a feature</a> for Android XR called "memory." The folks at UploadVR speculate this facial recognition could enable the AI to surface the name of someone you're speaking to. This is likely based on stored information the glasses have from the user.</p>
<h2 id="hypernova-beyond-2">Hypernova & Beyond</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are, of course, privacy concerns with an AI that's always active, viewing what you're doing in your daily life. The report suggests this feature will be an "opt-in" feature that users can freely use and then toss whenever. Additionally, these features are reportedly geared toward Meta's 2026 smart glasses: Aperol and Bellini.</p><p>Meta already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-bans-roll-out-live-ai-and-live-translation-add-new-frames-and-apps">debuted Live AI</a> last month in April. The feature is on its way to its current Ray-Ban smart glasses, bringing a conversational experience. In short, Live AI lets users ask about anything or hold "in-depth conversations with Meta AI without the vocal prompt. The publication's report notes that this feature only lasts for 30 minutes at a time on the current string of glasses.</p><p>As previously stated, Meta will look to extend those capabilities for a few "hours."</p><p>After this reported glimpse of 2026, we should come back to 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">as another report may have revealed</a> Meta's plans for its Hypernova glasses. Hypernova is said to deliver a singular display on the bottom right of its right-side lens. The glasses are reportedly preparing to feature a full set of Android-powered computational hardware and a gesture band.</p><p>The band is said to make it easier to manage what's on your single display.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is testing a new “Discussion” feature for mobile Search, showing up mainly during sports-related searches.</li><li>The feature lets users post comments, reply, and upvote or downvote posts, kind of like a Reddit thread.</li><li>It’s still in beta and only pops up when you search “Team vs Team” in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is currently testing out a new “Discussion” feature for its mobile Search app. Spotted during searches about sports events, this experimental setup pulls in real user takes and drops them straight into your mobile search results.</p><p>SEO consultant Nicholas McDonough shared some screenshots showing what looks like Reddit-style threads coming to Google Search on mobile (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-discussions-beta-feature-39393.html" target="_blank">Search Engine Roundtable</a>). The experimental feature would let users post comments, reply to others, and rate posts with simple upvotes and downvotes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When did Google Discussions beta launch? (mobile only) I’ve seen it tested off and on. cc: @rustybrick @glenngabe pic.twitter.com/L7uJxgQaTa<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1921365910012436671">May 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The early version of this feature is being tested in beta on mobile and only kicks in when you search something like “Team vs Team” in the U.S.</p><p>Before users start chiming in, Google Search lays out the usual sports rundown, including live scores and schedules. Then, front and center, you’ll spot the new “Discussions” tab, ready for fans to jump in and share their thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="sports-only-for-now-2">Sports-only (for now)</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this new feature is still limited to sports stuff for now. When you’re checking out a game card, the “Discussions” tab shows up right next to other sections like “Overview,” “Scorecard,” and “Stats.”</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:828px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:143.84%;"><img id="gRyeVqLnEjsp6r7dSPjFzn" name="Google-Search-discussions-tab" alt="discussions panel on Google Search for mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gRyeVqLnEjsp6r7dSPjFzn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="828" height="1191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas McDonough / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:828px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.43%;"><img id="LKfby5Dfcqatt2yUX3Qp2o" name="Google-Search-discussions-tab" alt="discussions panel on Google Search for mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKfby5Dfcqatt2yUX3Qp2o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="828" height="1792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas McDonough / X)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The “Discussions” tab is open to anyone with a Google account. You can jump in, share your thoughts on the game, and once you comment, your profile picture shows up. Other users won’t see your full name unless they hit the “More comments” button at the bottom.</p><p>Even though the setup feels a lot like Reddit or your usual comment section, there’s one big catch—no @mention feature. You can post replies, but there’s no way to tag someone directly, so they might not even see it.</p><p>If you’re trying to get someone’s attention, your best bet is to reply fast while they’re still active. But even then, it’s a bit of a gamble, especially in busy threads.</p><p>With AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google’s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> gaining ground, it’s clear Google feels the pressure to step up its Search features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has appointed former broadcast journalist Evan Solomon as the new federal Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Minister. This makes him Canada's first federal AI minister (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/national/cp-newsalert-former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-named-ai-minister/article_3db96b2e-9f96-5872-8930-c85e7eeb27e2.html">as reported by the Canadian Press</a>).</p><p>By creating this new division in his cabinet, he will solely be responsible for overseeing the steadfast growth in the sector and its integration into the country's economy.</p><p>Since 2022, the Canadian government has been talking about AI and even introduced bills, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act-aida-companion-document">Artificial Intelligence and Data Act </a>(AIDA), which was the most comprehensive bill that detailed a national AI framework, but none of these bills have gone to become laws yet.</p>
<p>As of now, Solomon's specific mandates have not been made public. However, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/former-broadcaster-evan-solomon-faces-big-challenge-as-first-ai-minister">National Post</a>, Solomon's responsibilities would likely focus on three main items: "re-igniting Canada’s technology sector, updating its framework policies to deal with a wide range of digital issues, including finding the balance between economic growth and security and privacy concerns, and improving the federal government’s efforts to make better use of digital technology."</p><p>The appointment of a dedicated Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation could be a step in the right direction. To note, the Ministry of Innovation has been part of the country for many years; however, it now has an AI sub-section.</p><p>It is also important to note that Prime Minister Carney's ties to the U.K. and the E.U., and the E.U.'s approach to tech regulation with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, might influence Canada's AI legislative direction.</p><p>Canada might take a page from the EU's notebook for some of its principles with tech innovation and addressing the risks beforehand.</p><p>It is also important that earlier this year, President Trump <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2025/03/ai-czar-david-sacks-means-for-federal-it-modernization-perfcon">appointed</a> venture capitalist David Sacks the first-ever artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar.  While other countries like France and the UAE also have ministers tending to AI within broader portfolios.</p>

<p>Audio might progress further than users may expect, as Nothing reveals its latest partnership.</p><p>Today (May 13), Nothing announced a partnership with the renowned British audio pioneer, KEF, in a press release. The purpose of these two companies coming together is to forward an innovative and "refined" audio experience for Nothing's consumers. According to Nothing, KEF's experience in high-fidelity audio should usher in an "expansion into new audio categories" for the company.</p><p>The company states it's looking ahead to bringing "acoustic precision" alongside its recognizable design elements to consumers. Nothing's head of smart products marketing, Andrew Freshwater, says, "By combining KEF’s decades of expertise with our design-led approach to technology, we’re laying the groundwork for a new standard in everyday listening."</p><p>The post teases that there are already a few of these acoustically precise products in development between the two companies. Nothing adds that it is seeking a long-term partnership with KEF to continue opening "new pathways" into expertly crafted audio products for its consumers.</p>

<p>Freshwater adds, "Our products launching later this year mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter of our collaboration and the future of Nothing Audio." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership">separate post</a>, KEF stated that more information regarding these products will be available "in the coming months."</p><p>There's one thing to note about KEF: the company is known for creating a wide variety of audio products like earbuds/headphones, but also wireless speakers, subwoofers, and more. If Nothing is pursuing new audio categories, perhaps these are some of the products we could expect with its label alongside KEF.</p><p>Nothing has been in the earbud game for a while now, even its sub-brand, CMF, has gotten <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">into budget alternatives</a>. The company's flagship line stepped into open earbuds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a> last year. Despite these being open-ear earbuds (these don't sit in your ear canal), Nothing still achieved some rocking bass when listening to music. Moreover, the Ear Open was quite comfortable in our review of the product.</p><p>The next few months should be interesting, as we await more from Nothing and KEF.</p>

<p>You might not have noticed, but Google's starting to give its classic "G" logo a bit of a colorful refresh.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/">9to5Google</a>, the standard multi-colored "G" logo, present on the main Google app on mobile, looks slightly different, per an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942">App Store</a> update. The "G" is still present — even in the same "font," you could say — however, the key difference is its color style. Google has moved away from its clear, distinct sections for red, yellow, green, and blue.</p><p>Instead, Apple's App Store shows these colors blending in a more gradient style.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the colors briefly take on a different tone before turning into Google's next signature hue. For example, as the red blends into yellow, it's briefly orange, which is what you'd get if you were still taking art class. Yellow and green create a lime-ish green, while green and blue almost make a turquoise color.</p><p>This change appeared on the App Store for iOS devices early this week, but Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US">has yet to receive it</a>. The Play Store is still displaying the (now) old logo. The publication notes that the logo gradient rolled out to the Google app in beta. It's not yet clear when Android users will see it more widely.</p>

<p>The 9to5 post also notes that this is the first time (in 10 years) Google has done anything to its "G" logo since changing it into what we've come to know. The publication reminds us of the old lowercase "g" against a blue background before the company's app redesign to uppercase in September 2015.</p><p>There's also the old Gmail logo, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-redesigning-iconic-gmail-logo">underwent a font redesign</a> in 2020. The app moved away from the red "M" against an envelope to an "M" that stands on its own with Google's multi-colored design. That change also took a little while before it was everywhere, so Google's behavior in the present day isn't too strange.</p><p>A few months earlier in 2020, Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-overhauls-photos-new-logo-map-view-and-cleaner-design">picked up a logo redesign</a> that made its pinwheel logo a little less sharp. Previously, the multi-colored pinwheel felt more geometrical, offering straighter edges and sharper points. However, in the summer of 2020, Google opted to soften those edges, as it took on a more "modern" appeal.</p><p>Interestingly, this change comes at a time when Google's Android Show is discussing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">everything new and exciting</a> coming to the OS. Among the updates was talk of Material 3 Expressive, Android's new major design overhaul. There's a chance Google could look to bring this gradient look to more apps, as 9to5 notes, but only time will tell.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid the flurry of Google's Android updates today (May 13), Samsung enters the fray with a major announcement for its watches and buds.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/google-gemini-coming-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-buds-smarter-wearables/">Newsroom post</a>, Samsung announced that its Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds will soon benefit from complete Google Gemini integration. Not only will Gemini further "extend AI functionalities" across its accessories, but each device will pick up a little uniqueness. Samsung states its Galaxy Watch integration gains "hands-free assistance using natural voice commands."</p><p>Galaxy Watch owners will be able to utilize Gemini for reminders, summaries, and notification reading. For reminders, users can tell Gemini to "remember" what locker they're using or an important task they need to complete. Additionally, you can even tell Gemini to "summarize my last email," which will prompt the AI to give you an "overview" of its contents.</p><p>Samsung states Gemini's intelligence will work across your apps to avoid hiccups and streamline the process.</p><p>When it comes to the company's Galaxy Buds, the post highlights the Galaxy Buds 3 series, as Samsung says Gemini works well with their voice and pinch controls.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 series</a> features a radical new design with a long stem that features its own touch controls. Samsung says users will soon be able to activate Gemini via their buds and "smoothly interact with your smartphone." Users can quickly leverage Gemini's help for weather forecasts without needing to reach for their phones.</p><p>These updates are set to hit Galaxy Watches and Galaxy Buds "in the coming months." More information about it is likely to surface closer to Samsung's planned release date.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Google and its AI Gemini continues, especially following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. A more recent update hit S25 users, which brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-update-brings-gemini-live-capabilities-to-samsung-galaxy-s25-users">Gemini Live capabilities to the trio</a>. The update debuted Gemini Live's visual conversational abilities to S25 users for real-time help over an abundance of topics. Gemini Live can be activated by pressing and holding the S25's side button, enabling it to see what you see for assistance.</p><p>Outside of that, Samsung's announcement is well-timed as Google is busy with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">Android Show flurry of updates</a>.

<hr>
<p>If your phone or favorite app suddenly looks a little more stylish, colorful, and friendlier, it’s probably thanks to Google’s new design update it's calling Material 3 Expressive.</p><p>At the upcoming I/O developer conference, Google is set to officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">show off the next big chapter in Android’s design story</a>, which got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-leaked-its-own-design-process-for-material-3-expressive">leaked earlier this month</a>. It's not just giving it a fresh coat of paint — the company is switching things up in a big way.</p><p>In a fresh blog post, Google explains that M3 Expressive is all about design that feels good, makes sense, and helps you do what you came to do. It leans on five key ingredients, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment to subtly steer your attention to the stuff that actually matters on your screen.</p>

<p>The new design direction aims to build interfaces that actually connect with users on a deeper, more emotional level. Big shifts like this don’t just change how Android looks, but also change how app developers build and shape their apps too.</p><p>Google is hyping M3 Expressive as its most heavily tested design system ever, and it has the numbers to back it up. After 46 rounds of design tweaks and feedback from over 18,000 people, the company has landed on a style that leans hard on color, shape, size, and motion to make everything feel smoother and easier to use.</p>

<p>The tech giant conducted its research to look into what grabbed people’s attention in a design, how different visual styles made them feel, and how quickly they could figure out what an interface was supposed to do.</p>
<h2 id="speed-demon-mode-2">Speed demon mode</h2>
<p>Google also went into the specifics with its testing, like figuring out which progress bar made wait times feel shorter, or how big a button should be to hit it easily without covering up the rest of the screen. It even dug into how different loading animations mess with our sense of time while waiting.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company claims that Material 3 Expressive helps users spot key interface elements up to four times faster than the old Material 3 design. Additionally, it levels the playing field across age groups, with users over 45 finding interface elements just as quickly as younger folks, as per Google.</p>

<p>Google I/O season is upon us, but this year, Google is doing something different. Instead of mixing all the exciting announcements in with boring coding events meant for developers, The Android Show is debuting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">a week ahead of Google I/O</a>, bringing all the exciting new Android announcements we all care about, so the developers can stick to their thing next week.</p><p>Today, we’re expecting to hear all about the new Material design update, called Material 3 Expressive, that’s coming along with Android 16. Gemini will make an appearance in new places and on new types of devices this year, bringing new features and enhanced convenience with it.</p><p>Google continues to shore up users against the never-ending threats the internet brings, including new scam prevention features for calls and texts. Lastly, Google looks to have a brief update on RCS communication in the U.S. now that carriers and iPhones have fully moved over to the newest wireless communication standard.</p>

<p>Of all the new announcements today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> is the most exciting. Material design made its debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-ui-design-holo-material-design-material-you"><u>a decade ago</u></a> with Android 6, bringing along a paper-like aesthetic complete with a UI that changed colors based on the app on screen.</p><p>Android 12 debuted the second-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you"><u>Material You</u></a>, allowing users to select the colors <em>they wanted</em> for the UI instead of apps leading the charge. Material 3 Expressive is all about taking the core color tenets of Material You and adding in a touch of liveliness, playfulness, and customization.</p><p>Now, when you dismiss a notification on Pixel phones or other phones that use Android 16’s Material 3 Expressive as its base theme, you’ll see the notification “tear away” from the rest of the notifications in the stack. Animations around the UI now bounce and emit a playful energy they didn’t have before. Even small elements of the UI now have life, like when you adjust the volume slider or pull down the notification shade.</p><p>We saw Google hint at this coming on Pixel phones a few years ago, as the volume and brightness sliders would emit a ticking vibration as if you were rotating a physical dial. Google is also updating dynamic color schemes to offer more user-selectable visual choices than ever before.</p><p>And let’s face it, Material 3 Expressive is a <em>much</em> better name than Material You.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qmTxbQXAdrhH7FuiimNCbC" name="material-3-expressive-notification-swipe-animation" alt="The new notification swipe animation in Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmTxbQXAdrhH7FuiimNCbC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh my gosh seriously, look at that animation! Notifications are grouped together in a subtle way that becomes clear the moment you try to swipe one away. They almost look like leaves on a vine, as the whole stack gets lightly tugged one way until the one you're grabbing delivers a satisfying "snap" off the group. I can see myself playing with these kinds of animations for hours, how about you?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tEraS5nPSvn48ccV4W4H2D" name="material-3-expressive-notification-shade-quick-toggles" alt="The new quick toggles design from Material 3 Expressive in Android 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEraS5nPSvn48ccV4W4H2D.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Material 3 Expressive isn’t just about colors. It’s also about improving your overall experience! Foremost to the experience is the revamped notification and quick toggles shade that ditches the annoying black/white color scheme from Material You with a customizable, semi-transparent design. The quick toggle section can now fit 12 or more icons in a single space, and it’s much more customizable than Pixel and stock Android users have seen it in ages.</p><p>Across apps, icons and buttons are now larger, better defined, and easier to find when they follow the new design language. Google says that its own user studies show up to a 4x speed increase in recognition, thanks to the new design. Apps like Gmail are seeing a huge new redesign to put the most prominent action icons right where you can see them instead of being hidden behind menus.</p><p>There’s even a new Live Updates feature that pins a “glanceable live tile” to your notification shade so you won’t miss out. It’s a little bit like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone"><u>Samsung’s Now Bar</u></a> or the myriad of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dynamic-island-android-hole-punch-cameras-overhaul"><u>Dynamic Island-inspired ideas</u></a> on other Android phones, but now properly baked into the base OS itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wRWt2YtwxqLnpbyUpUjgsJ" name="material-3-expressive-live-notifications" alt="The new Live Notifications in Android 16's Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRWt2YtwxqLnpbyUpUjgsJ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pinned notifications for important content isn't anything new, but Live Notifications melds the concept with some other recent ideas in an attempt to make them more useful and glaceable. You can see them in the notification shade, on the lock screen, and even on the always-on display. Do you find this useful, or is it just annoying?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="F63qkTWBhs5cQAXcrCqAnG" name="material-3-expressive-wear-os-6-themes" alt="A quick tour through all the new Material 3 Expressive designs in Google Wear OS 3 on a Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F63qkTWBhs5cQAXcrCqAnG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wear OS users aren’t missing out on the brand new Material 3 Expressive design, as Google is totally overhauling significant parts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6"><u>Wear OS 6</u></a> to fit the new design language. Google continues to embrace the trademark circle shape of most Wear OS watches, further optimizing the UI to look and feel better on non-square displays.</p><p>Google says the new animations and designs “trace the curvature of the display” as you scroll and interact, making it feel like an OS that’s built for a circular watch rather than looking at a square OS through a circular window.</p><p>This even includes new shape-morphing elements that scale better between screen sizes, so you can enjoy the best experience on smaller watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review"><u>Pixel Watch 3</u></a> without having to opt for a more massive option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b" name="material-3-expressive-wear-os-6-themes-2" alt="New Material 3 Expressive themes in Wear OS 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g66WNsr94kKKwxFvNhTG9b.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might expect from Material 3 Expressive, Wear OS 6 will be integrating a lot more customization via color options and a more customizable UI. Watch faces can now define the color of the entire OS, so your themed experience is felt throughout instead of just on the watch face.</p><p>Google says the new button and notification design is made to “hug the display” as it moves, taking up as much real estate as possible and making the most of the screen. There are even new stretchable buttons that are easier to tap, so you don’t have to be quite as precise with actions. I’ve found small buttons on watches to be a pain more than once, so this is a welcome change!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMBRmvtrPeBrAF6jEftDR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini is on its way to more devices than ever, starting with Android Auto, TVs, and Wear OS. As expected, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show"><u>Gemini is replacing Google Assistant</u></a> on every device Google can pack it in, enabling more natural speech and actions than Assistant could ever offer.</p><p>But it’s not just about letting you be your awkward self and still get things done. Gemini ties into more Google apps than Assistant could, giving you the ability to quickly search emails from your wrist with just your voice, or set complex reminders with multiple actions.</p><p>Responses are much better than before, too, as Gemini uses more natural language and delivers glanceable information on wrists and in cars when you don't want (or can't) to look at a screen for a long time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve never been a fan of having a giant touch screen to further distract me from the road, and apparently, Google has been listening to critics as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">Gemini integration into Android Auto</a> is making things more hands-free and <em>eyes-free</em> than ever. Gemini will be able to do tons of new things completely hands-free, whereas before you had to scroll through lists and tap lots of buttons, acting as a distraction from driving instead of a helpful tool.</p><p>Google says Gemini will be able to read messages out loud and not only allow you to reply to them in real-time, but it can also translate messages before they’re sent.</p><p>Gemini can also summarize text threads, emails, and other notifications so that you can get an idea of what’s happening while you’re driving without having to manually navigate through all the fluff. It sounds like a dream come true, really, and it’s coming later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H" name="Gemini-on-Android- XR" alt="Planning your vacation with Gemini on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google TV is also getting the Gemini upgrade, which should help you find what you want to watch next without worrying about which service has it available.</p><p>Later this year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses"><u>Samsung’s mixed reality headset</u></a> launches, Gemini will power the experience in ways we’ve never seen before. Google says that Gemini in-headset "can help you do things like plan a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps, and local tips, creating an entire itinerary in minutes while providing a more."</p><p>This should be a lot more visual, interesting, and powerful than trying to navigate all of this stuff on a tiny phone screen. Google previously said that Gemini through a mixed reality headset or smart glasses can also control actions in the headset, so you could likely ask it to help you perform actions for you instead of following a tutorial.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been the victim of fraud, you know how bad it feels to have someone trick you or steal your identity. Thankfully, Google is using AI in a way we’ve all been wanting: to help stop criminals in their tracks before they can swindle you out of your hard-earned money.</p><p>A bevy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-show-io-2025-security-privacy-details"><u>new security features</u></a> is coming to all Android phones, not just ones powered by Android 16 later this year, and it all adds up to a more secure, comfortable smartphone experience. Paramount to these features is a new warnings system built into the Android dialer and Google Messages which help prevent fraud by popping up messages when common scam tactics are used.</p><p>One example Google used is that apps won’t be allowed to be sideloaded while you’re sharing your screen, and banking apps will now warn you that someone is watching before you accidentally share confidential information with “tech support” on the other end. It’s a series of huge new moves Google is making to help make its users feel safer online, and it’s <em>great</em> to see!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:283px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.01%;"><img id="cqyqTvesS8VWbxRK7vaTm4" name="google-play-protect-live-threat-updates" alt="Google's Live Threat Detection for Play Services shows an alert of an "unsafe" app found from a malicious developer.

<p>A new live threat detection feature will keep track of app changes, helping to prevent apps from abruptly changing their names or icons in order to hide from a user. This commonly happened with scam apps as it would prevent users from uninstalling them since the app changed its name or icon after being installed. This one is coming to <em>all</em> Android phones with Google Play Services installed.</p><p>Google Messages is also getting a big security update with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">AI-based detection</a> that can help stop scammers pretending to be toll road authorities, bill collectors, crypto scams, financial impersonation, gift card and prize scams, "tech support" scams, and several other new categories. These messages will be automatically flagged and filtered as spam if spam detection is enabled.</p><p>Users can also participate in a new Key Verifier program in Google Messages on phones running Android 10 and higher. Key Verifier uses public encryption keys to further verify end-to-end encrypted messages, so you can be <em>sure</em> that the person you're texting is actually that person and not an impersonator. Key Verifier is launching this summer.</p>

<p>Some of us are still a bit undecided about the design changes coming with Material 3 Expressive. However, something that did catch my eye was seeing the floating bars appear at the bottom of some of the apps.</p><p>In the example above, Fitbit lets you jump between time frames for whatever information you're looking at. The Google Photos app seems to be making it easier to share and edit your pictures without jumping through a bunch of menus.</p><p>IMO, it's a much better solution than sticking a bunch of menus and sub-menus behind a hamburger menu.</p>

<p>Shortly after The Android Show wrapped up, Google surprised us with a new beta. Unfortunately, this doesn't include the Material 3 Expressive design changes that were shown off. Instead, it's <em>just</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta4.1">Android 16 Beta 4.1</a>, which includes a number of bug fixes.</p><p>We suspect to learn more about the new design changes and anything else that Google didn't show off today. I/O 2025 will kick off at 1 PM ET on May 20 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. And has been the case for a few years, you'll be able to watch the Keynote alongside everyone else.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the presentation, Dieter Bohn, Android Central alumnus and Director of Product Narrative at Google, was showing off some of the latest devices to be released. These included the Pixel 9a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/should-you-buy-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>, along with foldables on one end of the table and a tablet propped up on the other.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSvFbPYQDlI">Shane Craig</a>, this isn't just another Samsung device being shown off, as it's actually running what appears to be Google's revamped Desktop Mode. Unfortunately, there aren't any close-ups of the tablet showing off the interface more than the floating windows and taskbar.</p><p>It's difficult to really discern, but Craig goes on to suggest that this could have been our first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">Pixel Tablet 2</a>. To me, it looks more like a Samsung Galaxy tablet that's running stock Android as opposed to OneUI, but who knows? Maybe Google will have a surprise for everyone at I/O next week.</p>

<p>Google isn't the only company excited about Gemini coming to more devices. Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-gemini-galaxy-watch-buds-integration-announcement">announced</a> today that it's integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy smartwatches</a> and accessories "in the coming months."</p><p>For the Galaxy Watch, this means you'll be able to pull up Gemini straight from your wrist to bring up reminders, summarize emails, and more, based on Gemini's ability to work across apps. And for Galaxy Buds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Buds 3 Pro</a>, users will be able to easily trigger Gemini without reaching for their phones.</p><p>Now the question remains: who will get Gemini on a smartwatch first? Google or Samsung 🤔</p>

Google is partnering with companies such as July, Mokobara, and Peak, as well as airlines around the world, so that losing your luggage or skis will become a thing of the past.</p><p>Find Hub will also work with ultra-wide band (UWB) tags like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a> for even more precise location item tracking.</p><p>Finally, just like all your iPhone friends follow each other on Apple's Find My app, Google's new Find Hub will let you and your friends track each other for added peace of mind or just for the fun of it. And satellite connectivity will make it even easier to stay connected when you don't have a signal, which is pretty handy.</p>

<hr>
<p>Get hyped; it's Google I/O season, and the company's new Android Show: I/O Edition is helping to fuel the excitement. It details everything new with your security.</p><p>In a press release, Google stated that there are a few ways it will look to strengthen your Android device's security and privacy for calls, texts, and more soon. The company states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> ranks "highest" in Android security and anti-fraud efficacy. To further this, Google says it's first looking to enhance the ways your Android phone can shield you against phone scams.</p><p>To do this, Google states it's working on ways for Android's software to block "specific actions" and offer additional warnings against scam attempts. The post adds that all of this happens on your device for calls with people not in your contacts. What's more, if you're sharing your Android screen during a call and it ends, the OS will prompt you to stop sharing to avoid any unwanted attention.</p><p>Speaking of screen sharing, "enhanced in-call protection for banking apps" aims to stop fraud. According to Google, Android will soon warn users who've shared their screen while on a call when their banking app is launched. These warnings will occur with people outside of your contacts. The warning alert will inform users of the dangers, as well as offer a button to quickly end their shared screen session.</p><p>Google states this will roll out for supported banking apps on devices with Android 11 and higher. The pilot program is looking to grab U.K. banks first "in the coming weeks" before looking at a wider rollout.</p>

<p>Scam detection in Google Messages is receiving upgrades, as well as the introduction of the Key Verifier.</p><p>Regarding the former, the company says its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">AI-powered Scam Detection</a> software in Messages has been refined to target additional malicious attempts. Such scams include toll road/billing, crypto, financial impersonation, gift card/prizes, technical support scams, and more.</p><p>The Key Verifier is a new feature Google is preparing to launch to better enhance on-device fraud protection. In short, the post says the Key Verifier will let users verify the identity of the person on the other side through "public encryption keys." An example where the Key Verifier can work is during a SIM swap attack. Google says this can happen when an attacker removes your friend's or family member's SIM card and places it into an alternate device.</p><p>If this happens, Google Messages verification of them will disappear, informing you visually that the person texting you is not who they claim. To verify contact keys, Google says users can do so via the Contacts app with a QR code scan or number comparison. The Key Verifier is expected to launch "this summer" on Android 10 and higher.</p>

Google says it's working to extend this feature's availability to more devices through Android 16. Also, the feature's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/factory-reset-protection-what-you-need-know">Factory Reset protections</a> will get a glow-up, restricting all device functions that have been reset against the true owner's authorization.

The feature will roll out to Pixel 6 and higher devices, as well as a "selection" of other phones, in the coming months."</p><p>The company concludes by stating it's updating the rules of its Live Threat Detection to better catch threats via apps. These bolstered changes are available globally for all Android devices with Google Play Services.</p><p>The Android Show's security and privacy updates are likely a prelude to even more Android OS announcements from Google later this month.

<hr>
<p>It's I/O season! As we wait for the ball to drop, Google's Android team decided to give us some of the biggest news across the Android ecosystem before we head to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect"> Google I/O later this month. </a></p><p>This is the first time that the tech giant has decided to show off what's coming to Google's devices across its ecosystem, without holding it off for I/O. Google announced during the show that it will be bringing Gemini's smarts to more devices that people use daily.</p><p>It started by replacing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">Google Assistant with Gemini </a>earlier this year, and things have just taken off since then. Now, it's expanding Gemini's power to Wear OS, Google TV, Android Auto, and even Android XR.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhWgAgmmjezkdQ9PtrZdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will be integrated into Wear OS, helping users stay on top of things straight from their wrists. During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-teases-a-special-i-o-edition-of-the-android-show">The Android Show</a>, Google showed off how Gemini on Wear OS will help users stay more productive and work hands-free when they're unable to get to the phone.</p><p>"Like when your hands are covered in flour while cooking, when you’re rushing between meetings, or when you’re in the middle of a bike ride," Google explained in the press release.</p><p>All users need to do is summon Gemini with their voice and give it a command. Google says it doesn't have to be a fully thought-out sentence; it could be as brief as, "Hey Google, remember I’m using locker 43 today.” Or users could even ask Gemini about the restaurant their friend emailed about and get the answer on their wrist, as seen below.</p>

<p>Cars are also getting a Gemini-sized upgrade on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>. While voice commands have been at the center of Android Auto, with Gemini, the tech giant says users can do more on the move.</p><p>Gemini, built into Android Auto, will be a more intuitive assistant that can gauge what the user wants "through natural conversations." So instead of hitting on the right response or choosing the right text to send, Gemini will let you do all of that hands-free.</p><p>Google says Gemini can find you a location that exactly fits your needs. For instance, you can give it a complex command like, "find me a charging station on the way to the post office that’s also near a park, so that I can go for a walk before your errands while your car is charging."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374" name="Gemini-across-more-devices" alt="The Android Show I/O Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsE7shvNu34jmjcCLgv374.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, users can integrate Gemini with their messaging apps to summarize messages and even translate their replies into another language before sending, as seen in the GIF above.</p><p>During your morning commute, you can ask Gemini to give you "the rundown of the news today (but without sports), or get a quick synopsis of the book that you didn't get around to finishing before your book club meeting," Google added.</p>

<p>Gemini Live on Android Auto is integrated to translate texts in over 40 languages, and users can edit that message without having to start from scratch, just with a voice command. Gemini will be available on Android Auto "in the coming months, followed by cars with Google," the press release added. This integration will also be shown at Google I/O later this month.</p>

<p>Next, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything" target="_blank">Google TV </a>is also getting a slice of Gemini Live. From asking the TV to play age-appropriate shows or movies for the kids to answering questions about the solar system by pulling up the perfect YouTube video, Google TV is said to go beyond just showcasing entertainment.</p>

<p>Google is taking Gemini a step further, integrating it into the world of Extended Reality — this includes next-gen devices like XR headsets and smartglasses.</p><p>While Google didn't mention anything about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">smartglasses </a>that could be in the works, the company confirmed that Gemini will be integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses" target="_blank">Samsung's XR headset</a>, which is set to launch later this year.</p><p>Google says that with the Samsung headset and Gemini Live collab, it "can help you do things like plan a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps, and local tips, creating an entire itinerary in minutes while providing a more," giving a sense that they're already at their vacay spot even before getting on the plane.</p><p>Finally, Google hinted that Gemini will be coming to Sony and Samsung's audio systems, "bringing you personalized, powerful, and proactive help—wherever you are, on whatever Android device you’re using."</p><p>You can catch all the announcements from The Android Show and get even more in-depth analysis on our exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">Live Blog.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I remember when the first Kindle debuted. "It looks just like paper," they said, and I didn't believe it until I finally got my hands on one several years later. Since then, E Ink has evolved into an entire display category that covers the gamut of devices, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, monitors, and even full-fledged PCs.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div>
<p>But, unlike its early iterations, E Ink doesn't have to be just black and white. Like real ink, E Ink now comes in a variety of styles that allow up to 4096 colors to be displayed, giving you a sort of muted, pastel palette. E Ink provides a contrast level that's similar to OLED when the frontlight is off, giving you literal <em>inky blacks</em> in the darkest parts of the image.</p><p>While I've had the chance to mess around with most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a> to date, I only recently got my first <strong>color E Ink</strong> tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-Read-Write-Thickness-Computer-Touchscreen/dp/B0DM1LJRSJ">Bigme B1051C Pro</a>. Sure, it's not a name that rolls off the tongue, but you'll forget that the moment you pick it up. It's 1.5mm thinner than our favorite color E Ink tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</a>, and it comes in at 45g lighter than that tablet, too.</p><p>Plus, with 50% more RAM and a version of Android that's 2 years newer, you can do a lot more with it than you probably expect.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-color-e-ink-anyway-2">What the heck is color E Ink, anyway?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gWLbjnxKN4xJjKRmf4DwW5" name="Color-Print-ePaper_Kaleido_scheme_ENG" alt="The E Ink company's explainer for how color E Ink works" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWLbjnxKN4xJjKRmf4DwW5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: E Ink)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might already know what E Ink is and how it works, but just in case, here's a quick refresher. Traditional displays use a backlight that is then filtered through a red, green, and blue color filter to create colored pixels. The image you see is made up of millions of these pixels aligned in a grid pattern, which is what the resolution of a display means.</p><p>E Ink uses magnetically charged spheres that are either black or white. These spheres are then physically pulled to the surface to create the image you see. Instead of a resolution measurement, E Ink is usually measured in DPI — that's dots per inch, like an ink printer is measured. E Ink is reflective by nature and is easier on the eyes since it doesn't require artificial light to illuminate the display.</p><p>Color E Ink is a hybrid of these two technologies, utilizing the magnetically charged sphere design of E Ink, which is collected into color filters more like a traditional display. This means that color E Ink retains the reflective, eye-friendly nature of E Ink displays while allowing for some of the color produced by a traditional display.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY8n-T2z9Zs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>To see this in action, check out the video above at the 1:15 timestamp. As you watch, pay attention to how the display uses each of the red, green, and blue "sub-pixels" while the image on the screen changes. When those negatively charged white particles are pulled into one of these chambers, you'll start to see color appear.</p><p>The colors on screen have a pastel hue to them because the white particles are the base color, effectively making each color filter lighter than it really is. When a positively black particle is pulled into the chamber, it goes completely dark, looking properly "inky black" just as an OLED might be described.</p><p>All of this combines to make the Bigme B1051C Pro's display look like each frame was printed on a piece of paper. It's incredible, and the fast refresh rate of the E Ink Carta particles inside ensure that it's more able to keep up with the demands of modern apps than previous generations of E Ink displays could.</p>
<h2 id="a-regular-tablet-but-different-2">A regular tablet, but different</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cdv5QeFgaFnZn45pQtVzUD" name="bigme-b1051c-pro-display-close-icons" alt="An up-close look at the texture of the Bigme B1051C Pro's color E Ink display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cdv5QeFgaFnZn45pQtVzUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OK, so how can a color E Ink tablet be "a regular tablet" but also be different? Like any technology, the Bigme B1051C Pro has its advantages and disadvantages. If you have a tablet and regularly use it for web browsing, emailing, reading books, comics, or manga, or just use it as a secondary device for social media or communication apps, this tablet is going to blow you away.</p><p>However, if you just use your tablet to binge-watch shows, something like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Honor Pad V9</a> is probably a better choice. I don't watch videos on tablets, though, so this product makes a lot of sense for me. This is effectively a laptop replacement for me because I do almost all the same things on it that I do on my work laptop — the big exception being the photo and video editing that's required for my work.</p><p>Outside of those, though, everything from reading forums and researching topics to writing articles and even watching YouTube videos is entirely possible on the Bigme B1051 C Pro. You're likely not going to want to binge-watch the latest Netflix shows on this display, but watching anime on it is uniquely interesting because it feels like watching a manga that came to life.</p>

<p>The Bigme B1051C Pro is powered by Android 14 and comes with Google Play support out of the box, plus the inclusion of several Bigme exclusive apps. One of the highlights is BigmeGPT 4.0, which Bigme says is available for life without a subscription and enables realtime translation, transcription, and all sorts of useful note-taking features.</p><p>Each tablet comes with a stylus that feels more authentic to write with than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-multiple-s-pens-on-your-galaxy-phone-or-tablet">the S Pen</a> on Samsung Galaxy phones, for instance. The matte layer on top of the Bigme B1051C Pro's screen has a texture that feels a bit like writing on construction paper and it's impressively tactile and comfortable, unlike writing on glass.</p><p>The stylus doesn't need to be charged, yet it looks and feels like one that does. While it doesn't have pressure levels like some active styluses provide, it does magnetically dock on the top of the tablet for easy storage.</p><p>Bigme sent me its keyboard case with the unit, as well, and it feels a lot more capable and comfortable than cases I've used for other E Ink tablets. First off, it's actually sturdy and doesn't feel like it's doing to fall over if I don't have it perfectly positioned. The kickstand is part of the cover and folds back to any position you need.</p>

<p>The keys have excellent travel and feel similar to most modern laptops, which are all pretty similar to the MacBook Pro design these days. The keys are a little more cramped than those on bigger laptops, though, so it's worth noting that bigger hands may have trouble.</p><p>I also <em>love</em> the touchpad provided, as it's an ideal size relative to the keyboard and is impressively responsive. When the tablet is attached to the case, it's activated via POGO pins and automatically registers with the tablet. That gives you instant mouse and keyboard support without any pairing or charging nonsense.</p><p>My one complaint with the tablet is the battery life, which is not terrible, but it's not quite to the level I expected out of an E Ink tablet. You'll get several hours of use on a single charge, but I expect something more along the lines of <em>days</em> of use out of a device like this. At least it uses USB-C, which is ubiquitous these days.</p>

<p>The obvious question is, why would you opt for only 4096 colors on an E Ink display when LCD and OLED tablets can give you millions or billions of colors? The main reason is eye health.</p><p>Since E Ink doesn't require a backlight to be visible, you can opt for environmental lighting that's significantly easier on your eyes over time. That's most important for the devices that you're using for hours every day, as it cuts down on eye strain from backlit LCDs or direct-lit OLEDs over time.</p><p>It also means that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">the ultra-bright displays of today</a> aren't needed to overcome the sun when outdoors, since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/testing-three-eye-friendly-display-technologies">E Ink displays accept and reflect</a> a portion of the light just as a normal piece of paper or a book does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MdCcDEqeQBjR6D7JnP4s8J" name="e-ink-vs-lcd-vs-oled-reading-in-sunlight-1" alt="Comparing outdoor reading capabilities of LCD, OLED, and E-Ink tablets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MdCcDEqeQBjR6D7JnP4s8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But aside from the limited color palette, E Ink isn't the perfect alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">LCD or OLED</a> just yet. The biggest problem is the refresh rate, which falls squarely into the photosensitive epilepsy range of 3-30Hz. E Ink Kaleido 3 has the potential to refresh at up to 60Hz, but it often falls close to the sub-20Hz range.</p><p>Companies like Bigme don't normally highlight the specific refresh rate of these types of devices, normally sticking to marketing terms like "SSS super speed" instead of an actual number. Whatever the exact number is, it's not quite 30FPS as it doesn't match the smoothness of an LCD or OLED display running 30FPS content side-by-side in my testing.</p><p>This means that while color E Ink checks almost all the boxes required to help the most flicker-sensitive users, it still needs improvement with the refresh rate so that the full screen refresh cycles don't result in visible white/black/white flickering. The E Ink Corporation is hard at work on Kaleido 4, which is expected to deliver something like this, but until then, E Ink devices remain the most useful for reading, taking notes, writing, and light web browsing.</p>

<p>While Samsung still hasn’t stopped rolling out One UI 7 updates to older Galaxy models, new information reveals what to expect from the next operating system, One UI 8.</p><p>According to the latest APK teardown from the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-listen-brief-now-brief-apk-teardown-3556952/">Android Authority</a>, new findings from One UI 8 firmware have revealed that Samsung is working on a Listen Brief button, which seems to be an enhancement over the existing Now Brief feature — introduced in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>.</p>

<p>For the unaware, One UI 7’s Now Brief feature is a Galaxy AI-powered personalized summary of the day that showcases weather, other suggested content and actions that can be done during the day. While it is majorly text-based, new findings from One UI 8 firmware reveal that the company is working on a new “Listen Brief” button.</p><p>According to the publication, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, the upcoming Listen Brief is notably an audio version of the same as it will also likely offer a summary of the user’s morning, afternoon, or evening — further including weather forecasts, calendar events, preferred news, and traffic updates.</p>
<h2 id="an-upgrade-over-the-one-ui-7-s-now-brief-2">An upgrade over the One UI 7's Now Brief?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seemingly, the Listen Brief makes it more handy than the Now Brief already is as it eliminates the need to read long text summaries, which can be a useful feature for busy people on the go. It might also be a helpful accessibility feature for those who are visually impaired.</p><p>The hidden code from the One UI 8 firmware in the findings also indicates that users should be able to choose from either Samsung or Google’s text-to-speech engines. Further, they will also be able to play, pause, or stop the audio briefing, which means they could also expect playback controls for the Listen Brief functionality.</p><p>While Now Brief itself can be improved in so many ways with new incorporations, One UI 8 should likely bring them starting with the Listen Brief. Users have to also bear in mind that since the feature is currently being tested, it may or may not be seen in the final release of Samsung’s next notable operating system.</p>
<h2 id="more-one-ui-8-leaks-2">More One UI 8 Leaks</h2>
<p>In other One UI 8-related news, the operating system should additionally bring some exciting new features, per the recently spotted and rumored features. The operating system <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-get-you-a-secret-vault-for-your-photos-in-one-ui-8">is tipped</a> to be bringing a secret vault for photos.</p><p>Also, new ‘Actions’ via Google Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">were spotted</a> in an alleged One UI 8 Watch leak.

<ul><li>Google Keep's web client gains support for rich text formatting (bold, underline, italics, headings), aligning it with the Android app's capabilities.</li><li>The latest formatting options are accessible through an underlined "A" button and are available to all Google Workspace customers next to personal Google account users.</li><li>As the roll out of the feature has just begun all users should be able to see the feature in the coming days or weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced a bunch of Workspace updates late last week that include Google Keep, and features to the Gemini app as well.</p><p>Google Keep has gained significant improvements for its web client, and they include features like rich text formatting. This feature has been available for Android devices for quite some time now — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-text-formatting-rollout">since 2023</a>, to be precise — and it has finally arrived for the web version, the search giant has announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/release-notes-05-09-2025.html">Workspace blog post</a>.</p><p>The latest expansion here includes text customizations like the ability to add "text through bolding, underlining, italicizing, and heading styles on the web." While Google Keep for web has been around since its inception, these text customizations were long awaited, especially since they were available for the Android client.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.17%;"><img id="dTVeNPexmDXa8UEAi6RkLi" name="Google-Keep-rich-text-formatting" alt="Google Keep's new text formatting features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTVeNPexmDXa8UEAi6RkLi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="284" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google further notes that the text formatting features are available for the Google Keep web client for users including Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains, all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and anyone who uses a Google account and the notes app. Since the rollout has just begun, all users are expected to see the feature in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>The aforementioned users can find the new underlined "A" button, which gives users formatting options. Users will be able to see the H1, H2, header options alongside options like Bold, Italic, Underline, and Clear formatting features, as mentioned above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8k7wuQ6HDsY2v9tw7TeBF" name="google-pixel-5a-google-keep.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 5a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8k7wuQ6HDsY2v9tw7TeBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664857/google-keep-rich-text-formatting-web-app">The Verge</a> notes, it is still unclear whether the already structured notes from the Google Keep app client will sync with the web version automatically or is applicable only for the new notes created on the web client. It should be clearer once the wider rollout begins.</p><p>It is encouraging to see the search giant finally bringing these features to the web version of Google Keep. The new addition comes after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> gained notable features last year. The note-taking app has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-found-testing-new-handwritten-notes-feature">gained support</a> for handwritten notes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that feature a stylus like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S24 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and select phones from Motorola as well.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Tuesday morning, several Slack users were reportedly experiencing issues in connecting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platforms</a> and were having problems with loading the threads as well, according to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://slack-status.com/2025-05/7b32241eb41a54aa">Slack Status page</a>.</p><p>The Slack team appears to have quickly acknowledged the problem and started its investigation, which suggested a backend database routing issue, which made the messaging platform’s features unusable for some. After just a few hours, the issue with the platform has been resolved.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="vV9NdbCcwE2yXzPNDPgTUC" name="slack-new-interface-tooltip.jpg" alt="Slack" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vV9NdbCcwE2yXzPNDPgTUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Slack status page has further indicated that users experiencing problems in sending messages, loading channels, threads, canvases, Activity, and client details — will now see them working as the support team assures improvements being seen.</p><p>The last update from the status page indicates that everything was fixed by <strong>Tuesday (May 13) at 5:37 a.m. (GMT+5:30)</strong>. The Slack team has also apologized for the disruptions caused during the day. Since the issue appears to have been triggered early in the morning, not many users must have experienced the issue.</p><p>However, the latest outage is believed to be the second major outage of the year as one of them happened early this year, in February. It was also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/slack-is-down-impacting-workplaces-across-the-globe">global outage</a>, which took down several workplace communications offline. The issues included trouble logging in, messaging, and other app features.</p>
<p>Slack was able to restore the full functionality to all affected features of the platform and suggested users to reload the application to get it up smooth and running after the fix. We recommend users to do the same this time as well, since a smaller percentage of users appear to have been affected with the issue this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Slack has further assured that it is currently monitoring all health metrics and “working to resolve a small backlog of queued items.”</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo is doing all the right things in 2025; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> continues to be one of the best camera phones of the year, and I'm excited to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how it measures up this year. In the meantime, the V50 is turning out to be a reliable mid-ranger with the best design in its category.</p><p>That shouldn't be surprising in the least, considering Vivo is making a habit of launching gorgeous phones in the V series. I thoroughly enjoyed using the V30 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a>, and while there isn't a Pro model this time (it's likely coming later), the V50 retains the best features of its predecessors while getting a sizeable 6,000mAh silicon battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zSYetGx8xHW8sDx35RJbC5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSYetGx8xHW8sDx35RJbC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5070" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The V50 is available in select Southeast Asian countries, and in India, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/vivo-v50-5g-rose-red-128-gb/p/itm12bbdca230795">costs ₹34,999</a> ($413) for the standard 8GB/128GB model, ₹36,999 ($436) if you want 8GB/256GB, and ₹40,999 ($484) if you're looking to get the 12GB/512GB edition. It goes up against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> in the country, and Vivo is positioning the design and cameras as the key features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rho5RsyPMXzyzbJA5yKxR5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rho5RsyPMXzyzbJA5yKxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most is the design; phones have decidedly gotten boxier in recent years, and I'm not a fan of the trend. Thankfully, Vivo retained a thin design with smooth curves at the back, and it makes using the phone that much better. It has a glass back, but the polycarbonate mid-frame allowed Vivo to save weight, and although there's a 6000mAh battery, the phone comes in at a manageable 189g.</p>

<p>The sleeker profile definitely makes a difference in daily use, and the Red Rose color option I'm using is gorgeous — I still don't understand why brands reserve the best colors for their mid-range phones and not flagships. The frosted glass finish at the back accentuates the color, and the design of the camera island is better this time around; you still get a sizeable module, but it doesn't look anywhere as busy as the V40.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qB5x59kAAtDFY4W7MmzSQ5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qB5x59kAAtDFY4W7MmzSQ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has color-matched sides, and while that's undeniably good, the glossy finish detracts from the otherwise-great in-hand feel. The only other issue with the design is that the in-screen module is located a little too low, and it makes accessing it a bit awkward. That said, Vivo did a great job with ingress protection; the phone gets the standard IP68 dust and water resistance, and it even picks up IP69, allowing it to withstand jets of water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MtHhcK73wmxMhifo6knEP5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MtHhcK73wmxMhifo6knEP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo went with a slightly smaller 6.77-inch AMOLED panel on the V50, and the resolution is down to FHD+ (2392 x 1080). However, there isn't any noticeable difference in regular use between the device and the V40, and it gets just as bright. It's set to 60Hz out of the box, but you can easily switch to 120Hz via the settings, and I didn't notice any lag in day-to-day tasks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7JA7UbJhseNHrXCnXCmfH5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JA7UbJhseNHrXCnXCmfH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and there's a decent amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the colors. Another positive is that the phone gets stereo sound — much like the V40, and it makes using the onboard sound that much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PrzjXzjg5d4YfVdjRW3HN5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PrzjXzjg5d4YfVdjRW3HN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't anything new to talk about the performance, as the V50 is using the same Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 silicon as the V40 and the V30. I would have liked to see the 7s Gen 3 as it holds up a little better, and while the device is still good, it doesn't quite have the power needed to run demanding games at high settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ej5FXXS3iXfYCYZAU7xQM5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ej5FXXS3iXfYCYZAU7xQM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there isn't an issue with overheating, and outside of gaming, I didn't see any lag or slowdowns with the V50. The base 8GB/128GB is a bit limited in my view, and I'd suggest getting the 8GB/256GB option instead. Connectivity is pretty good too, and I didn't have problems making calls or connecting to my home network.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QTEMjSFbsdhXo2599cYZU5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTEMjSFbsdhXo2599cYZU5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Vivo continuing with a biannual release cadence, there isn't much that's different with the cameras on the V50. It has two 50MP lenses at the back, and while the main camera uses a slightly bigger module, I didn't see any difference in image quality. The phone continues to do a great job with portrait shots, and it is still one of the best mid-rangers in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="P7sPJMD7pTPbRiSCnXMJS5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7sPJMD7pTPbRiSCnXMJS5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is where I noticed the biggest difference, with the V50 having much better headroom thanks to a 6,000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon carbon battery</a>. The phone manages to last a day and a half comfortably between charges, and even with heavy use, there are no issues getting to the end of the day. It's a similar story with charging tech; with 90W USB PD as standard, it takes under 50 minutes to charge the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u59CehXYBdQrDnZzCGTkL5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u59CehXYBdQrDnZzCGTkL5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo is doing good things with software as well, and I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based Funtouch OS 15. The interface is fluid, there's extensive customizability, and I didn't see any issues with notifications or aggressive memory management. The only point to note in this regard is that the V50 will get three Android OS updates — one less than its immediate rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ApwdmzxQdMFwYn6sLEiyQ5" name="Vivo V50" alt="Vivo V50 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ApwdmzxQdMFwYn6sLEiyQ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the V50 doesn't really bring much new to the table, and that's okay. Vivo didn't need to alter the fundamentals too much, and by adding a bigger battery and refreshing the design, the brand delivered a device that's slightly better than its predecessor. If you need a camera-focused mid-ranger with a stylish design, the V50 is a great choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of the year where Sony usually launches its flagship Xperia series, and the company has one this year, the Xperia 1 VII, which has just gone official.</p><p>Like conventional flagships from Sony, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> also emphasizes camera, display, battery, with better sound quality taking the spot this year. Like its predecessor, the Xperia 1 VII comes with familiar specs that include the full 52MP (48MP effective) primary lens, another 50MP (48MP) secondary lens, and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens. The front also equips a 12MP selfie shooter. The rear cameras are also ZEISS and signature Sony Alpha-powered, which has been the case for the past couple of generations of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-phones">Xperia handsets</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg" name="sony-xperia-1-vii-01" alt="Sony Xperia 1 VII" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhohesFirrUMfuk5pPgpdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design, on the other hand, also appears familiar to the previous iteration; however, color options are limited to Moss Green, Orchid Purple, and State Black. The screen is a BRAVIA-powered 6.5 inch panel — a taller display with 19.5:9 ratio, Full HD+ resolution, and 120Hz refresh rates. The build quality includes Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and regular Victus for the back. Additionally, users can also experience IPX5/IPX8 water and IP6X dust resistance.</p><p>The Sony flagship is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> with a promise of four-year operating system upgrades and six years of security updates. It is powered by Qualcomm’s latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> coupled with 12GB of RAM and 256GB onboard storage, further includes support for expandable storage with up to 2TB micro SD. While the latter is pretty rare these days on any Android phone, another decent inclusion is the 3.5mm headphone jack that is still intact on the Xperia 1 VII.</p>

<p>Other notable features of the flagship include a 5000mAh battery capacity with support for Qi wireless charging and a promise of two-day battery life through a single charge. A high-quality sound with Sony’s proprietary WALKMAN DNA technology, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and a vapor chamber cooler for a more hassle-free gaming experience.</p><p>The Xperia 1 VII is up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/smartphones/products/xperia-1m7?sku=xqfs54eukcg.gc#overview">preorder</a> in the U.K., retailing at £1,399 for the sole 256GB variant, which is slightly higher than Samsung’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which is priced at £1,099 for the same storage variant.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung finally took the wraps off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, debuting the thinnest smartphone the company has made to date. It's got a stunning 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, a 200MP main camera on the back alongside a 12MP ultrawide camera, Corning Gorilla Armor 2 protection all around, and the top-notch Snapdragon 8 Elite processing package inside for true flagship-tier performance.</p><p>And while it comes in an unbelievably thin 5.8mm frame and the incomparable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> powering the experience, it has one major setback that's going to drive most of its users crazy: a tiny battery and relatively slow charging.</p><p>You see, while Samsung's software experience is truly superb and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is more feature-rich than any other company's AI offerings right now, Samsung's hardware team is still using outdated battery and charging tech. While it could offset this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-are-we-obsessed-with-charging-speeds">with faster charging tech</a>, the company has shown that it's not willing to keep up with the Joneses in this regard, either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like Honor and OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">are using silicon-carbon batteries</a> in their phones and have been for years, in Honor's case. Using a silicon carbon anode allows these companies to make denser batteries that are able to withstand extreme temperatures, last longer, and charge faster than the regular Li-Ion batteries Samsung uses.</p><p>Using a silicon-carbon anode negates the swelling that could otherwise occur with pure silicon batteries — something Samsung never wants to have happen after the Galaxy Note 7 — and makes it possible to increase the battery's density by around 13%. That means Samsung could have put a 4,400mAh battery inside the Galaxy S25 Edge if it used silicon carbon, whereas the Li-Ion battery inside the phone is only 3,900mAh.</p><p>Considering most modern Android phones sport batteries between 5,000mAh and 6,000mAh in capacity, battery life on the S25 Edge is all but guaranteed to be sub-par. Samsung confirmed to Android Central that the Galaxy S25 Edge's battery is made of the same materials as the rest of the S25 lineup. To be fair to Samsung, this battery is <em>only </em>100mAh smaller than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, and while battery life isn't horrible on that phone, it isn't excellent, either.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>A small battery is already a challenge, but 25W charging from 2020 makes it even worse.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Samsung could offset the small battery with ultra-fast charging, but the company doesn't seem to want to push that envelope, either. Instead, the S25 Edge maxes out at 25W. That's nearly 1/3 of what Honor offers on the 4.4mm thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor V3</a>, for example, meaning there's no chance to get a quick top-up if you run out of juice halfway through the day.</p><p>To make a truly successful ultra-thin flagship phone, a company has to conquer four main pillars: processing power and thermals, camera quality, battery life, and charging speed. Samsung seems to have nailed the first two thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, a thinner and broader heat chamber, and a 200MP main camera, but I have serious doubts about the remaining two requirements.</p><p>If nearly any other Android manufacturer made this phone — Vivo, Xiaomi, Honor, OnePlus, or Motorola — I think they could have nailed all four and called it a day. But Samsung's fear of battery technology and charging speeds is, once again, hamstringing the potential greatness of its latest flagship, and that's the real shame of it all.</p>

You get the same AI features, Snapdragon performance, and long software support found in the rest of the flagship lineup, but now they&apos;re in a lightweight, super-thin package.</p>

<p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> was too bulky for your taste, the S25 Edge might be the perfect solution, weighing just 163 grams and measuring to 5.8mm of thickness. For a little perspective, that's a full 2.4mm thinner than the S25 Ultra and 2.7mm thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The nice part is that this ultra-thin design doesn't come at the expense of most other specs. You still get a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a durable titanium-and-Gorilla Glass construction, while under the hood you'll enjoy the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Of course, a phone's battery is generally the component that contributes the most to weight and thickness, which means the Edge has the smallest battery of any phone in the S25 lineup. Samsung is still claiming that the S25 Edge will last all day on a single charge, but I'll believe it when I see it. Aside from that, though, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge seems destined to be one of the best-looking and sleekest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> released this year, and thanks to this preorder deal, it might end up being pretty darn cheap too.</p>

We’ve been waiting for the latest addition to the Galaxy S25 family for months, especially as we didn’t have much information about the key feature: its thickness.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> was already slimmer than its predecessors, but the Galaxy S25 Edge takes this to a whole new level. It measures just 5.8mm thick, making it one of the thinnest phones ever made and by far, the thinnest phone you can buy right now (at least until Apple launches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-5-key-rumored-features-from-an-ultra-thin-frame-to-so-so-battery-life">rumored iPhone 17 Air</a> later this year).</p><p>However, beyond the extremely thin profile, the Galaxy S25 Edge combines key parts of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to make a phone that feels familiar, yet unique.</p><p>I spent an hour with the Galaxy S25 Edge in New York City earlier today, and I was surprised at how much I like it. Here’s our first full look at Samsung’s new thin-and-mighty smartphone.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge won’t appeal to everyone. It lacks the full camera prowess of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and the battery is the smallest of the lineup, but these sacrifices come with a key benefit: its thickness and weight.</p><p>If you’ve been put off by the size or weight of the Galaxy S25 lineup, the Galaxy S25 Edge is the phone for you. At just 5.8mm thick, it's 2.4mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and 1.4-1.5mm thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-thickness-1" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wa9bcwvm3XXkQakjwHy6Ti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy S25 Edge (right) lying flat next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra (left). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s incredibly hefty, and the Galaxy S25 Edge fixes the key issues. Despite the large display and mighty main camera, it also weighs just 163g, one gram heavier than the smaller base Galaxy S25. As for the competition, the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.3mm thick, while the Pixel 9 Pro is 8.5mm. Both weigh 199 grams, making the Galaxy S25 much thinner and lighter than these devices.</p><p>Like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Edge features a titanium frame paired with Gorilla Glass protection on either side. The rear features Gorilla Glass Victus protection, while the front uses Corning’s new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2. It features the same protection as the Gorilla Glass Ceramic used on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but lacks the anti-reflective finish.</p>

<p>There are other subtle differences compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the sharp edges far more nuanced and much nicer in the hand. This subtle design change, combined with the thin and light build, means the Galaxy S25 Edge feels nicer in the hand than any of its siblings.</p>
<h2 id="flagship-specs-borrowed-from-the-s25-lineup-2">Flagship specs borrowed from the S25 lineup</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is designed to offer the best features of the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup in a slim and light device. It pairs the 6.7-inch display from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> with the same 200MP primary camera found on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The display features the same 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate and vision booster to boost the brightness, and looks just as great as the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>The 200MP camera is a key addition that ensures it still feels like a flagship phone, especially given its price. The camera has the same capabilities and features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, although the lack of a telephoto means it likely won’t be as capable at longer focal lengths.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-3" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5X3g5jjGrSrgzYF9ifFnTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung says the camera can offer 2x optical zoom, which is likely achieved through in-sensor cropping. It also uses pixel binning to combine nine pixels into one larger pixel, which allows it to capture more light. The main camera is paired with a 12MP ultra-wide camera, while the front camera is also a 12MP sensor, but much wider than the one used in the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor as the rest of its siblings. It is paired with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage, and if you pre-order in the US, you’ll get the latter at no additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-challenge-is-likely-to-be-battery-life-2">The biggest challenge is likely to be battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-27" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMjYdkCgRTCumFkvKjXSgi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is quite smart as it combines the best of the Galaxy S25 family into a new phone, but there’s one thing Samsung couldn’t get around: the laws of physics. In particular, the extremely thin profile means a smaller battery, and the smallest battery in the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>It features a 3,900 mAh battery paired with 25W wired charging. The battery is the smallest of a Samsung flagship in many years, and the charging is on par with the base Galaxy S25. However, it lacks the faster 45W charging support found on the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra.</p><p>Samsung says the battery delivers all-day battery life, but this is an area that we’ll need to test much further. Diving further into the battery life, Samsung says it’s better than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and almost as good as the base Galaxy S25, which leads me to believe that it may not last a full day under moderate to heavy usage. However, as a colleague remarked, the thin profile and light build make it worth the need for a recharge during the day.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-the-galaxy-s25-edge-far-more-than-i-expected-2">I like the Galaxy S25 Edge far more than I expected</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is now available for preorder and will hit stores on May 30. It comes in three colors — Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Icy Blue, and Titanium Silver — and costs $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage. It’s essentially $100 more than the Galaxy S25 Plus, and $200 less than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, although the best Galaxy S25 Edge pre-order deals could save you a considerable amount.</p><p>I don’t have a particular preference for ultra-thin phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">unlike some at Android Central</a>, but there’s no denying that the Galaxy S25 Ultra adds considerable weight to your pocket. The Galaxy S25 Edge shows you can have the best of both worlds, although the lack of a telephoto lens may prove disappointing in the long run. The battery is my primary concern, but time will tell whether it can last a full day as Samsung claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite these likely challenges, I’m surprised at how much I enjoyed the Galaxy S25 Edge in my short time with it. You may not think it, but the thin profile greatly affects how it feels in the hand. Despite being supremely thin, it still feels premium thanks to the titanium frame, and it isn’t as fragile as I had expected.</p><p>If you’ve been holding off on buying a Galaxy S25 series phone due to its weight or size, the Galaxy S25 Edge is worth checking out. The thin profile necessitates some compromises, but look beyond these, and you’ll find a phone that feels fantastic in the hand. Seeing is believing, and you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's "beyond slim" device has finally arrived.</p><p>The company, in a virtual Unpacked event, unveiled the slim fourth variant of the Galaxy S25 series: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. According to Samsung, this phone "strikes a new balance of premium, pro-level performance," and is crafted with both style and strength in mind.</p><p>While the phone's design has been shown off several times since its announcement, we weren't allowed to get up close to it, and Samsung had been pretty tight-lipped about it. Nevertheless, several leaks have provided a somewhat solid glimpse of what to expect from this "ultra-slim" device</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.67%;"><img id="cs3itcZXFjb52ZAa4LnPgb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-thinness" alt="A GIF of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cs3itcZXFjb52ZAa4LnPgb.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="352" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting with the phone's design, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has a durable titanium frame with rounded corners, which boasts a slender 5.8mm profile and weighs 163g. Despite its sleek design, the screen is protected by the latest Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, giving the device additional resiliency.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge comes with a 6.7-inch QHD+  Dynamic AMOLED display that offers smooth responsiveness with its 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The display is enhanced by a vision booster and adaptive color tone for optimal viewing in any environment.</p><p>At its core, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset </a>for Galaxy, much like the rest of the variants in this lineup. This chip will help with the advanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI </a>features, which this phone is said to come with, including Galaxy AI-powered editing features, like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25"> Audio Eraser</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-samsung-galaxy-s25"> Drawing Assist</a>.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a vertical, dual rear camera setup. Its primary 200MP wide-angle lens has optical image stabilization and an F/1.7 aperture to help capture 40% brighter images in low-light settings.</p><p>This lens also offers 2X zoom, but can go up to 10X digital zoom with the help of AI. The other lens is a 12MP ultrawide camera with an F/2.2 aperture, allowing users to capture more elements in their photos. As for its selfie camera, the device is equipped with a 12MP lens.</p><p>Furthermore, the device will come with Android 15 out of the box, along with Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, just like the other Galaxy S25 phones. The Galaxy S25 Edge also gets all the quirks of the OS, including features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, which now showcase third-party app integrations helping users keep up with their day-to-day tasks.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive specs, the Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a relatively compact 3,900mAh battery, suggesting that the Korean OEM traded off battery capacity to maintain the device's thin profile. The phone can reach up to 55% charge within 30 minutes, using the 25W wired adapter, and is also compatible with Qi2 wireless charging.</p><p>Additionally, the sleek phone gets an IP68 dust and water resistance certification, which gives the device comprehensive protection from dust.</p><p>As expected, the Galaxy S25 Edge also gets access Gemini's latest features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live camera and screen sharing</a> capabilities. The phone will also feature Galaxy Samsung Wallet’s soon-to-be-released<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-tap-to-transfer-is-finally-landing-on-us-galaxy-phones-this-month"> Tap to Transfer feature</a>, that makes sending money as easy as a phone bump.</p>

Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1921758366377857110" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_magic_v5_to_come_soon_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67731.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>) spotted what looks like a monster 5,950mAh battery in the paperwork.</p>

<p>The setup presumably uses a dual-cell design—2,070mAh and 3,880mAh—which adds up to 6,000mAh. That’s probably the number Honor will run with when the phone hits store shelves.</p><p>Whether Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v4-specs-have-leaked-and-the-oppo-find-n5-should-be-scared">plans to reduce the thickness even more with the Magic V5 is still up in the air</a>. Lately, phone makers have been all about going ultra-thin. But Honor has already made waves with the Magic V3, which measured only 9.2mm when folded.</p><p>Despite its super slim build, the Magic V3 still packed a surprisingly solid battery that held its own. For the record, it launched back in July last year with a total battery capacity of 5,150mAh.</p>

<p>While the Magic V5 may get a bigger battery, don’t expect faster charging to go with it. The regulatory listings show it’ll stick with 66W charging, which is the same as the Magic V3.</p><p>Honor hasn’t locked in a name yet. It could be called the Magic V4 or Magic V5. But there’s a good chance the company will skip “V4,” since the number 4 is often avoided in Chinese culture.</p><p>The Magic V5 is likely landing this July, just like the V2 and V3 before it. Both of those also got their global spotlight at IFA Berlin, so odds are Honor is sticking with that same rollout plan. That said, we wouldn’t rule out an earlier sneak peek either.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is shaking up the Subscriptions page in an update announced last month and rolling out now.</li><li>The page will now place Shorts at the top of the viewable area, requiring users to scroll to see traditional long-form content.</li><li>This tweak is rolling out for YouTube app users on TVs and consoles, including Apple and Google TV hardware.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is rolling out a change to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-use-machine-learning-to-figure-out-whos-lying-about-their-age">app for TVs and consoles</a> that prioritizes Shorts content over your subscriptions. The tweak, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/341112828?hl=en" target="_blank">announced</a> last month, shakes up the Subscriptions tab on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube app for TVs</a>.</p><p>It separates YouTube Shorts from long-form videos, placing Shorts at the very top of your subscriptions tab. This change is widely rolling out for TVs and consoles, including Google TV and Apple TV hardware, as reported by Reddit users and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/youtube-app-tv-shorts-subscriptions-feed/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-shorts-new-editor-ai-stickers-spring-rollout">Shorts</a> row on the Subscriptions page still only shows videos from channels and creators you're subscribed to. However, the vertical length of Shorts previews means that long-form YouTube videos aren't fully visible on the Subscriptions page anymore without scrolling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rvGTxMsS49FDoKPuokm29" name="YouTube-Shorts-TV-app-redesign" alt="The YouTube Shorts section atop the YouTube TV subscription feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rvGTxMsS49FDoKPuokm29.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, Shorts were mixed in with a user's main subscriptions feed. The new update adds separation for YouTube's vertical, short-form content and the platform's traditional horizontal, long-form content. For some, it will come at the expense of usability, as users now have to scroll to see their traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> subscription row on the Subscriptions page.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1kgvdh7/appletv_youtube_app_what_the_actual_duck">AppleTV Youtube app & What the actual duck ???</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>In the first few days following the new Subscriptions page's rollout, some users are already unhappy with the shift. One user on Reddit, u/AtlasMMX, pointed out the oddness of being unable to see their long-form subscription row on a 77-inch flatscreen TV. They particularly criticize the wasted space atop the Subscriptions page, which theoretically could be used to put Shorts and long-form content on the same viewable area.</p><p>It's just one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/search/?q=shorts+tv&type=posts&sort=new&cId=bfb2f6c7-9dd3-4f0e-8a2f-c51c8cb92e98&iId=aaa16093-c783-42e3-a1ab-bc604702847b" target="_blank">many Reddit posts</a> on the YouTube subreddit criticizing the move across platforms, including Google TV and Apple TV. Unfortunately, there's no way for YouTube users on TVs and consoles to rearrange the order of their Subscriptions page.</p>
