<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google expanded Pixel phone 5G availability to additional countries where previous models lacked 5G support.</li><li>With the addition of these new markets, the total count of supported regions now stands at 38, offering more choices for potential Pixel buyers.</li><li>Despite the expansion, Google does not officially sell its latest Pixel phones in the newly added markets, underscoring the complex distribution strategy of the company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just added more countries where you can get your hands on the Pixel phones&apos; 5G connectivity.</p><p>The search giant has quietly turned on 5G for Pixel phones in more places where even models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series didn&apos;t originally support connectivity features like 5G, VoLTE, or Wi-Fi calling. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/google-pixel-5g-countries/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Google added seven new territories to the mix, such as Croatia, Iceland, Latvia, Greece, Hungary, Lichtenstein, and Slovakia.</p><p>Now, with these new additions, the total count of supported markets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pixel.withgoogle.com/5G/" target="_blank">stands at 38</a>. This means more choices for users eager to snag one of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">popular Android phones</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that Google doesn&apos;t actually sell its latest Pixel phones, like the Pixel 8 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, in any of these newly added markets.</p><p>As per 9to5, the Pixel 8 series is exclusively sold through official Google Stores in just 20 countries. These include Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the United States.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear why the Mountain View-based tech giant is making this expansion, but it&apos;s likely that Google is broadening support in these areas due to a high number of people purchasing Pixels through unofficial channels in these countries.</p><p>In any case, this move should hopefully give Pixel owners a consistent connectivity experience as they move from one country to another.</p><p>Even so, Google Pixel&apos;s 5G availability still seems quite limited, with some regions like South America and Africa left out. Since 2020, users have been voicing concerns about the lack of universal Pixel 5G availability, and unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t seem to be changing anytime soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>A few years after Polar launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/polar-grit-x-smartwatch-review">Grit X Pro</a> smartwatch, the company is finally following up with an updated model, bringing a number of upgrades at a hefty price.</p><p>The Grit X2 Pro features a new rugged military-grade design with a casing made of stainless steel and sapphire glass covering the display for added protection. As for the display, Polar ditched the outdated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP screen</a> for a larger and more vivid AMOLED panel, yet the watch still manages impressive battery life despite the increased power draw. That means up to 10 days in smartwatch mode, 43 hours in Performance Training mode, and 140 hours in Eco Training mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="pRZuSXeGzxEiqa7Gxtf4kL" name="Polar-Grit-X2-Pro-map.jpg" alt="Polar Grit X2 Pro map" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRZuSXeGzxEiqa7Gxtf4kL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Polar)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Grit X2 Pro brings enhanced fitness training features for outdoor enthusiasts like trail runners and bikers, complete with 150 sports profiles. For example, the average ascent speed (VAM) provides insight into the rate at which you climb hills, while 3D speed combines your vertical speed and VAM to better calculate your true speed.</p><p>When you find yourself on a trail, Polar gives navigation a welcome boost thanks to dual GPS and support for various satellite systems. The Polar Grit X2 Pro also comes with a new Breadcrumbs feature, and users can now download maps for offline use with 32GB of built-in storage, meaning you&apos;ll always be able to find your way back.</p><p>The watch features Polar&apos;s Elixir biosensor, enabling a swathe of health tracking features, such as ECG, optical heart rate, SpO2, and skin temperature, for a more comprehensive view of various metrics. Combined with the various training modes and health tracking features, Polar says the Grit X2 Pro will offer users a more personalized experience to help them train, recover, and sleep better.</p>

<p>The Polar Grit X2 Pro is up for preorder starting on March 20 and goes on sale on April 3 for a whopping $749.90, significantly higher than the $499 starting price of the original Polar Grit X Pro. That price gets you the Night Black or Stone-Gray colorways, but you&apos;ll have to pay $50 more if you want the Grit X2 Pro Titan in Autumn Leather and Black Silicone.</p><p>Polar is also offering an $869.90 bundle deal that also throws in the H10 heart rate sensor, which we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">recently tested</a> alongside several fitness tracking devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7L6CnHzzPWNdsvzu4hXq8F" name="" alt="The Android Ecosystem" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7L6CnHzzPWNdsvzu4hXq8F.png" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7L6CnHzzPWNdsvzu4hXq8F.png" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Source: Google </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android is a free open-source operating system. The AOSP (<strong>A</strong>ndroid <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ource <strong>P</strong>roject) is free to download, free to alter, free to build into a product that can power just about anything. But it's not something you've ever used when you picked up a phone or other gizmo that runs "Android" because it's not really a complete operating system.</p>
<p>At its heart, Android is nothing more than a platform anyone can use to run applications bundled with the bits and pieces needed to talk to standard hardware. We tend to think of Android as an operating system for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> or tablet (or even a watch or television), but it&apos;s just a part of the software needed to get any device to turn on and do things. That being said, it&apos;s one of the most important parts.</p>
<p>Having a huge library of code that anyone can use is great. Having the things people build with it able to use the same applications is even better. </p><p>It&apos;s better for us because we will have a huge list of applications that work out of the box when we buy an Android-powered device. It&apos;s better for the companies making the devices because we&apos;ll want to buy them and they don&apos;t have to work to build a new application platform. It&apos;s also great for Google because it means more devices can use the internet and its services.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3" name="" alt="Android application framework" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3.png" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3.png" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Source: Google </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That last part is why Google maintains the AOSP. Google was founded upon the belief that everyone should have access to the internet. While some of the reasons may be charitable and good-natured, Google has these goals mainly because the internet is how it makes money. All companies exist to make money, but with the AOSP, Google has found a new way to make money from everyone while giving away one of its most expensive products: Android.</p>
<p>This is done through the AOSP. Google <em>maintains</em> the Android source code. That means exactly what you think it does: It keeps things clean, tidy, and up-to-date, making it available for others. It also has people working full-time to make improvements and add new features to Android. But plenty of other companies, both phone manufacturers you&apos;ve heard of like Samsung and others you might not know, contribute to the code that powers Android. It&apos;s a true community effort.</p>
<p>All of this is made available for anyone to freely use under a liberal license that allows changes to be made to the code and not submitted back to the maintainers. This means Samsung can do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">whatever it wants with the AOSP</a> and doesn&apos;t have to share what it has done with anyone. So are you, and so am I. If we do something different, we can keep those changes to ourselves to offer a (hopefully) better product than anyone else can or publish the changes so others can build upon them even further.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phones and gadgets we buy aren&apos;t running the AOSP as an operating system though. What we see is the result of someone or some company using it to create software that is unique and their own. This can be done by changing the code, adding even more code, or even adding applications that <em>aren&apos;t</em> open-sourced like the AOSP is. Every company that sells Android-powered gadgets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Google itself</a>, is doing this.</p>
<p>This fits into Google's methods to make money because there <em>are</em> some restrictions when a company wants to use Google's popular applications and services. If a company wants to include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google's mobile services</a> (and almost all phone makers do) it has to adhere to rules as a Google partner. Those rules make sure everyone knows about Google's money-making products.</p>
<p>The process is a circle. Google gives Android away. A company uses it on its phone. As consumers, we want Android phones that can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play</a> Gmail,  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, and all the other things that make Android great. The company making the phone can bundle those features in for free as long as it makes sure its product can use every other application found in the Google Play store. </p>

<p>Phone manufacturers, like Samsung, save time and money by not building their own application platform and application storefront; we get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best Android phone</a> with access to all the apps we love plus a market with over a million others, and Google gets a lot of people using its services and being on the internet to see Google&apos;s ads.</p>
<p>This couldn't happen without Android being free to use, so the time and money Google invests in Android makes it a very lucrative part of its business. By providing Android as source code anyone can use instead of a standalone product like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com">Windows</a>, Google can reap the benefits while another company does the work of building and maintaining a living operating system. AOSP means everyone wins, and that's the way we like it.</p>

Among all of the discounted Galaxy Tabs and Lenovo slabs on the site, Amazon has also begun dropping prices on its entire suite of Fire tablets, including our favorite, the Fire HD 8. Grab the 32GB version with lock-screen ads and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099Z8HLHT"><strong>you&apos;ll instantly save an epic 35%</strong></a> on your purchase, dropping the price of the device down to just $64.99. Go the version without lock-screen ads and you&apos;ll still only pay $79.99 during the sale. </p>

<p>Head to Amazon during the Big Spring Sale event and you'll score a whopping 35% discount on the Fire HD 8, no strings attached. For just 65 bucks, you're getting a versatile tablet with an 8-inch HD touchscreen display, 720p HD video recording, and up to 13 hours of battery life on a single charge. If you need more storage, the 64GB version is also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R"><strong>27% off</strong></a> during the sale, or you can expand the Fire HD 8 up to 1TB with one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">best microSD cards</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B099Z8HLHT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b258a74f-c4d4-46e1-bb98-680853da9706" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Among all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire tablets</a> that are out there, the Fire HD 8 earned the top spot in our list because of its versatile size, 13 hours of battery life, and surprisingly snappy hexa-core processor. It&apos;s powerful enough to stream all of your favorite content without skipping a beat, while the durable construction means that it&apos;s tough enough to be given to the kids during a long car ride. If you need more space, you can even expand the storage up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p><p>Sure, I wouldn&apos;t plan on doing a lot of graphics-intensive gaming (and you can&apos;t access the Google Play store), but if you want a simple couch companion with loads of battery life for cheap, this is the Fire tablet deal for you.</p>

<p>Google launched Wear OS 4 with the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on August 11, 2023. A few months later, the Pixel Watch 2 came out with the stock version of the OS on October 12, 2023. This was also when Google started rolling out the stable build of Wear OS 4 to other Android wearables, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4-coming-to-pixel-watch">including the last-gen Pixel Watch</a>.</p><p>As for Samsung&apos;s take on Wear OS 4, many of the older generations of the Galaxy Watch family have already received the One UI 5 Watch update. Both the Galaxy Watch 5 series and the Galaxy Watch 4 series have received the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-getting-one-ui-watch-5-update">One UI 5 Watch based on Wear OS 4 update</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4-google-io-2023">As announced at Google I/O 2023</a>, Wear OS 4 adds apps for Gmail and Google Calendar for the first time. You are now able to "quickly respond to emails...check your schedule, view and RSVP to events, and update task statuses" on your wrist.</p><p>Other additions include the new WhatsApp Wear OS app and Spotify&apos;s new updates such as the Tiles focused on podcasts, most-played songs, and the in-app DJ. Google Home has new controls like the ability to unlock your smart lock or check your Nest Doorbell feed on your wrist.</p><p>One of the bigger changes is the new Wear OS Watch Face Format co-created by Google and Samsung. Unlike the old Jetpack watch faces that had to be constantly optimized for better battery life and performance, new watch faces use "a declarative XML format" instead of actual code. Wear OS itself renders the watch face, so developers "no longer have to worry about code optimizations or battery performance." You can customize your own watch faces, complete with custom designs and behaviors.</p>

<p>Last and certainly not least, Google finally brought a more seamless data transfer option to the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2. Users can now backup and restore data on Wear OS 4. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/how-to-back-up-reset-samsung-galaxy-watch-5">back up Galaxy Watches</a>, but owners of stock Wear OS watches have been requesting the feature for years.</p><p>Plus, during the set-up process for any Wear OS watch, your app permissions "will automatically carry over" from your Android phone, Google says.</p><p>As for other Wear OS 4 updates, new changes like "power optimizations" make apps run more efficiently than in Wear OS 3, as well as new data types in Health Services.

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-one-ui-5-watch-features">One UI 5 Watch</a> technically isn&apos;t associated with Google&apos;s version of Wear OS 4, as Samsung&apos;s version preceded it by a few months. But One UI 5.5 Watch is based on the final Wear OS 4.</p><p>First, One UI 5 Watch adds irregular heart rate notifications based on your heart rate monitor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-irregular-heart-rhythm-notifications-fda-clearance">Approved by the FDA</a>, Samsung&apos;s AFib detection directs you to take an ECG on your Galaxy Watch 5 (or other models) for a more direct reading.</p><p>Next, a new Sleep Insights UI gives you a redesigned sleep score and Enhanced Sleep Coaching, and the watch no longer flashes the green LEDs when it detects possible sleep — a frequent complaint from users. Plus, it now offers menstrual cycle tracking using the skin temperature sensor.</p><p>On the fitness side, Samsung incorporated personalized workout intensity levels and heart rate zones. It also implements fall detection and better SOS functionality. As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> users, they are now able to directly access a GPX map database to install running and hiking maps for their workouts.</p><p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-behind-apple-watchos-for-fitness">Samsung is running behind Apple in fitness</a>, these features are certainly a welcome sign that it&apos;s taking fitness software more seriously.</p><p>You also receive three key new Wear OS apps on the Galaxy Watch series: a revamped Samsung Wallet app, WhatsApp, and ThermoCheck. </p>

I didn’t go with that because it would sound like a press release, but when you drill down to what Sennheiser has done here, that’s exactly what stands out most about these earbuds, which support lossless streaming over Bluetooth (if you also have a phone that supports it). I’ll dive into that future in detail in a bit, but first, I’m going to tell you that you should never buy based on what a product may be but what it is right now! </p><p>Confused? Don’t be. </p><p>What Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds are today is outstanding. They don’t include spatial audio, and some competitors may have a stronger feature here or there, but Sennheiser does high-end sound so well that these Momentums and the strength of their features make them a serious contender in a market that already has some tough competition in the $300 price range.</p>

<p>Sennheiser announced the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds on January 8, 2024, with a pre-order date of February 15th and availability on March 1. Priced at $299.99, that’s a $50 increase over the $249.95 launch of the Momentum True Wireless 3 in 2022. </p><p>You have three colors you can choose from: black copper, metallic silver, and graphite. I have the graphite pair for review. They have a long list of features, but you should know they won’t ship with all of them. We’ll get into that momentarily. </p>

<p>As I said earlier, this article could be titled “Momentum 4 the future,” but much like Veruca Salt, I want what I want and I want it now! And Sennheiser delivers that in spades, er, musical notes. </p><p>Cracking the box open, you’re met with what looks nearly identical to the previous generation earbuds—that sweet, sweet tweed charging case. The Momentum True Wireless 3’s body is black, but I like the new graphite more.</p><p>The shape of the earbuds is nearly identical, but the earbud tips have a new trick this year. The previous model had a “+” with mesh beneath it, which wasn’t easy to clean. This year, a perforated silicon surface was molded into the inner portion of the ear tip, which I think handles wax buildup from workouts better.</p><p>In addition to the usual sizes, you get a set of extra small tips for those with baby-like ear canals like me. You’ll also get a total of three ear fins to help with sizing, which is a nice addition as they add some friction where the buds sit against the concha. All of this made the Momentum True Wireless 4s comfortable for extended periods of wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DRxmCgmH3m6vUAfDqEd6PN" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-comparing-momentum-3-eartips.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 eartips compared with Momentum True Wireless 3 eartips" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DRxmCgmH3m6vUAfDqEd6PN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll also get the USB-C charge cable in the box, which you won’t need if you’re going to charge wirelessly overnight. When charging over the cable, it will take an hour and a half to get to a full charge, and eight minutes of quick charging will give you an hour of playback. Sennheiser says you’ll get up to seven and a half hours of playback with ANC off and seven with it on. That held pretty true to spec for my use, but more long-term testing will reveal how consistent that is as I listen to more hi-res audio files. </p><p>When it comes to power, one of the options I appreciate in these lithium ion-equipped earbuds is a new “Battery Protection Mode” in the Smart Control app. This feature charges the unit slower and prevents charging to 100% to prolong the lifespan of your battery. I charge on a Qi wireless enabled pad at night, and the fully charged case will get you up to 30 hours of additional listening time so this slower Qi charging is a non-issue for me.</p>

<p>There are truly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> on the market with more effective noise canceling, but these still did a solid job in my testing. As I walked neighborhood side streets and a busy main street, the MTW4s did a great job of canceling or dampening the majority of sound with their improved adaptive noise canceling, although this is notably something I only do when testing earbuds. Usually, I walk with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/transparency-mode-killed-open-ear-headphones-for-me">transparency modes</a> activated to maintain my situational awareness. Sitting in my office and blasting 80dB of airplane cabin noise on YouTube, with no music playing, that noise was significantly hushed but not canceled. With music playing, that cabin noise was barely noticeable. </p><p>The transparency mode isn’t just “on,” but it also has a slider in the app that allows you to set the level of transparency from “Low” to “High.” It sounds pretty natural, and though I tested it at various levels, I keep it at “High.” Placing it on “Low” feels more like it’s an ANC slider than transparency and defeats the point.</p><p>Still, in terms of earbuds that I’ve listened to in the last year, these are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">best for ANC</a> implementation, even if they don’t place first or second for their effectiveness.</p><p>You’ll get pretty solid call quality out of the six MEMS and beamforming microphones (three on each bud) when you do make calls. During one of my test calls, my buddy on the other end couldn’t tell I was using a Bluetooth earpiece, and that was in my car with the windows down at times. On the other hand, I tested mic quality standing next to a water feature in front of a luxury high-rise on a major street, and I sounded “robotic.” The MTW4 did an excellent job of removing some serious background noise, but my actual vocal quality was middling. </p><p>Your location will matter in terms of how natural you sound, but in the oft-quiet room conditions we take Zoom or Google Meet calls from, you should be fine. Your mileage may vary if you find yourself in a noisy cafe.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZB9684L6HVNJsqdnvGBtXo" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-in-ear-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 in ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZB9684L6HVNJsqdnvGBtXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best way for me to test audio, which has been improved over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review">Momentum True Wireless 3</a>, was to hit Tidal and the locally stored FLAC files on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> and utilize the aptX codec supported by the MTW4s. Playing audio back in standard aptX at CD quality (16bit, 44.1kHz) is a delightful experience and one of the reasons why Sennheiser continues to be my “go-to” for active listening. Despite being what I call “boom bap balanced,” Sennheiser produces a large soundstage regardless of musical genre. This is evident when listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes.” Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s acapella intro has a heavenly quality, and when the instrumentation finally kicks in around a minute and ten seconds into the song, the meticulously layered stereo image is absolutely beautiful.</p><p>Boom bap balanced is a reference to hip-hop-inspired tuning, which shines through on what is arguably among the best produced and engineered rap songs, “Still D.R.E.,” making Dr. Dre’s tracks and samples crystal clear. His and Snoop Dogg’s vocals are bright and never muddy, and the way Dr. Dre plays with the panning between the song’s body and Snoop’s smooth delivery of the chorus is a Master Class in rap track engineering. But I digress.</p><p>The out-of-the-box sound experience on the Momentum True Wireless 4s is an excellent boom bap balanced base to begin with, but going through the guided EQ customization of the Smart Controls app&apos;s Sound Personalization feature elevates the overall experience. I pulled the mids and highs a bit more forward by the end of the personalization routine, resulting in one of the best Bluetooth earbud listening experiences I’ve had with Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ‘Em.” But it doesn&apos;t stop there.</p><p>The Smart Control app provides additional customization options. Tapping “edit” on the Equalizer tile allows you to utilize a variety of Sennheiser presets, use its five-band equalizer to adjust frequency nodes, or use the Sound Check feature to tailor multiple EQs to accommodate specific genres you listen to.</p>

<p>The MTW4&apos;s chipset is Qualcomm’s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with Snapdragon Sound with Bluetooth 5.4 and support for aptX Lossless, aptX Adaptive Audio, Bluetooth LE Audio, LC3, and Auracast. That&apos;s what will enable those future upgrades and future-proof these earbuds.</p><p>The claim is that the chipset will enable “bit-by-bit flawless audio transmission.” Sweet! However, if you’re the average smartphone consumer in North America, you likely don’t currently own a phone that supports aptX Lossless or Adaptive Audio. Boo!</p><p>Nontheless, LE Audio will eventually include an updated LC3 codec in the MTW4s. The Bluetooth SIG says this codec will improve battery life by streaming audio at lower data rates without compromising quality.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Auracast, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-bluetooth-le-audio-stream-discovery">your Bluetooth connection to the world</a>. It enables a single-source public address system to broadcast audio to what they claim will be a limitless number of devices, kind of like FM radio (if you’re FM radio years old and know what that is). So you can easily pick up audio from TVs at the gym or that self-led docent tour at your favorite museum. </p><p>What&apos;s most exciting is what Auracast enables for those who wear hearing aids. They&apos;ll get direct audio feeds without the hearing aids having to process ambient sound so users can hear TVs and music. Auracast support is also coming to the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds via a future firmware update.</p>

<p>In addition to the earbuds not having all the features at launch, the Momentum True Wireless 4&apos;s case is larger than some of its competition, making it a tight fit in your jeans coin pocket and a bit bulky in a pants pocket. It isn&apos;t terrible, but you feel that difference if you&apos;ve been using something a bit more svelte.</p><p>The ANC, though well implemented, doesn&apos;t allow you to just crank it to the max and stay there. This is, after all, adaptive noise canceling, which, as the name implies, automatically adjusts to your surroundings. It&apos;s a plus for battery life when you don&apos;t need aggressive canceling, and the level scales down along with battery usage, but sitting at my quiet desk typing this with it on and no music playing, I can hear my delightfully clicky and loud mechanical keyboard. However, when pressing play on "Texas Hold&apos; Em" again, the clicky keys are barely perceptible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwjaYZ3YFQoUrB7zio8wsL" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-closed-case-closeup.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 charging case close up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwjaYZ3YFQoUrB7zio8wsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else I don&apos;t care about is that the charge port for the case is on the front, while the charge cables on my desk are routed through the back. So, if I turn it around and plug it up, I can’t see the charging indicator. I imagine this design decision was likely made because of the wireless charging, but it still seems... backward.</p>

<p>One of my favorite earbuds this year, so far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/technics-eah-az80-review">Technics EAH-AZ80</a>, beats Sennheiser in the multipoint race, being the first to support three device simultaneous connections. And for those looking for something with a bit more swag in terms of design, its brushed metal aesthetic is eye-catching. Then, of course, when we’re talking about noise canceling as a priority in your purchasing decision, you’re going to look at Sony’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">WF-1000XM5</a> and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds. There’s also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/beats-fit-pro-review">Beats Fit Pro</a> if workouts are a central part of your life- another favorite of mine.</p><p>Looking at that competition, you just really need to know what’s most important to you. Technics’ sound profile is more treble forward out of the box, Beats are definitely heavier in the bottom end than Sennheiser, and Bose is absolutely neutral when compared to the Sennheiser curve.</p><p>Other than standing out with Bluetooth 5.4, Sennheiser also has the highest durability rating at IP54, upgrading from the IPX4 found in the previous generation and the current competition.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HvK4yyNQgmcY543hSBkFe8" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-on-pixel-7-pro-hero.jpeg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 on top of Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HvK4yyNQgmcY543hSBkFe8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Big, airy, warm sound is important to you </li><li>You like and listen to everything. All the genres </li><li>You like living on the bleeding edge of tech and are willing to bet on being able to access future enhancements</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Noise canceling is your top priority</li><li>You don't care about lossless audio</li><li>Your wallet weeps at the thought of spending $300 for earbuds</li></ul>
<p>Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint pairing, an exhaustive list of codec support, and Sennheiser sound are among the many reasons to take a hard look at Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds for your next audio gear purchase. They check all the right boxes for me, including the most important one: sound quality. Sure, there are better noise-canceling earbuds on the market, but when we talk about cancellation effectiveness, how many of you engage in an activity and use your earbuds with no audio? With audio playing, the difference in quality between Sennheiser and its competitors is negligible, and you don’t have to sacrifice audio quality for it.</p><p>If Sennheiser and the Bluetooth SIG deliver on their technological promises, that could make these the earbuds to beat in the near future if you’re outside the U.S. Stateside though, only time will tell as we wait for handset manufacturers to implement all that Bluetooth 5.4 offers.</p>

<ul><li>Users with a Connect subscription can archive large files and store them in the cloud.</li><li>The desktop app has a more traditional notebook feel to it. </li><li>Type Folio users will have access to new keyboard shortcuts. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users of reMarkable paper tablets will now be able to take advantage of having unlimited cloud storage as part of the company’s 3.10 software release. The update, which is rolling out, also brings new updates for the desktop app as well as a slew of other improvements, including new sorting features and keyboard shortcuts, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.remarkable.com/remarkables-new-software-release-adds-cloud-archiving-and-handwriting-conversion-in-the-desktop-app">per the company&apos;s blog</a>. </p><p>The most noteworthy feature is the aforementioned cloud storage capabilities that users will be able to take advantage of. Users will now be able to archive large or unused files and place them in the cloud. Those archived files will always be accessible on the reMarkable mobile and desktop apps along with the device itself. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">reMarkable 2</a> provides 8GB of onboard storage, freeing up large or unwanted files is always a safe bet, especially if those files can be easily accessed later on. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2427px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zo5V8S5xbgM8BKwkkMFWR8" name="reMarkable-archive-files.jpg" alt="Archiving files on a reMarkable device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zo5V8S5xbgM8BKwkkMFWR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2427" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: reMarkable)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s important to note that to take advantage of this new feature, users must have an active Connect subscription. Connect provides users with unlimited cloud storage along with note-taking on desktop and mobile and extra protection for the device. It costs $2.99 a month or $29.90 annually, though consumers are given a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.remarkable.com/s/article/Information-about-Connect">one-year Connect trial</a> when they purchase the reMarkable 2 on the company’s shop. </p><p>reMarkable users will also notice that the desktop app has a new look following the 3.10 software release. The app is now more in line with a traditional notebook, featuring paper-like background colors and a Serif font. </p><p>Additionally, those who are subscribed to Connect can now convert their handwritten notes into typed text directly from the desktop app, where they can edit them in full. Handwritten notes can be converted into text from an entire page, a range of pages, or single pieces within a page. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2427px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aCPWC5bzmU6dHUXy9pCMd8" name="reMarkable-files.jpg" alt="Viewing files on a reMarkable device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aCPWC5bzmU6dHUXy9pCMd8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2427" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: reMarkable)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out the update are new sorting features on the table itself that allow users to organize files alphabetically or by their last modified date. Tablet users who have a Type Folio keyboard will also have access to new shortcuts that make browsing documents even easier. Lastly, handwritten notes that are converted using the selection tool will no longer be saved to the clipboard and will instead be pasted onto the page. </p><p>reMarkable also notes in its blog that multiple tablets can be paired to one account, therefore allowing users to see updates made from a reMarkable 2 on a first-gen tablet and so forth. In all, these updates continue the Norwegian company’s commitment to changing the way consumers take notes, read, and edit documents. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's upcoming Pixel 8a is a budget smartphone based on the Pixel 8, and it could debut in a few months. </li><li>The smartphone was recently spotted in FCC databases, which is a clear indicator that the Pixel 8a is on the way. </li><li>Now, a major leak confirms that the Pixel 8a will feature a 120Hz display, a Tensor G3 chip, and more upgrades. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s budget lineup of A-series phones has seen significant upgrades over the past few years, bringing the Pixel devices in line with Pixel flagships. The Pixel 7a, for example, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-vs-7">so similar to the Pixel 7</a> that some wondered whether Google would even release a Pixel 8a this year. Nevertheless, a Pixel 8a is all but confirmed, and a major leak just gave us a bunch of details about the upcoming smartphone. </p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8a-specs-exclusive-3426314/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which confirms a few things we already knew about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and adds some fresh detail as well. For starters, the display is going to reach flagship quality thanks to the boost to 120Hz. The Pixel 6a had a 60Hz refresh rate, and the Pixel 7a got the upgrade to 90Hz. Now, with the Pixel 8a projected to get 120Hz, it&apos;s on par with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> available.</p><p>Namely, it&apos;s identical to the Pixel 8&apos;s display specifications. Android Authority also reports that the Pixel 8a will be brighter, supporting 1,400 nits at peak brightness. The Pixel 8a is also expected to keep the same 6.1-inch screen size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, but the corner radius is reportedly changing to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series. In all, the display is getting a big upgrade, and it&apos;s going to be even closer to flagship quality than ever. </p><p>In a more unsurprising move, the Pixel 8a should be powered by the Tensor G3 chip. That&apos;s the same as the Pixel 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">as we&apos;ve learned</a> with some AI features, the inclusion of the Tensor G3 chip doesn&apos;t guarantee the Pixel 8a will have the same feature set as other Pixel 8 series devices. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:555px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="fPsRXSJ5mYLKggjqJpWbfV" name="google-pixel-8a-retail-box.jpg" alt="Pixel 8a retail box showing a black version of the phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPsRXSJ5mYLKggjqJpWbfV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="555" height="740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @chunvn8888 / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8a is tabbed to get functional display output over USB-C, joining the other Pixel 8 series devices. Though Google enabled DisplayPort at the hardware level on the Pixel 8 lineup this year, it only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2-pixel-8-display-out">recently activated the feature in beta software</a> releases.</p><p>Something that isn&apos;t changing is the camera system. The Pixel 7a got an upgrade to its main camera sensor last year, and Google is using the same one in the Pixel 8a.  </p><p>The Pixel 8a is likely to launch soon, perhaps at the Google I/O event slated for early May 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-reaches-us-fcc-listing">FCC approved multiple models of the Pixel 8a</a> on Monday, March 18, which is a sign that new devices are close to release.</p>

<p>Amazon doesn&apos;t refresh its best-selling Kindle lineup very often. Unlike Android phones and tablets, e-readers see updated models once in two to three years. It probably doesn&apos;t make sense to upgrade such devices as often as phones because the improvements would be too minimal.</p><p>Every single one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Amazon&apos;s Kindle e-readers</a> have had black and white displays to date. It&apos;s not like the technology for color e-paper doesn&apos;t exist, though. Competitors like Onyx Boox and Pocketbook have long since taken advantage of the E Ink Corporation&apos;s color e-paper displays.</p><p>Now that color e-ink displays are several generations old, it seems like Amazon might cash in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="buq6EuQNRDatmJBKwQjAgc" name="Onyx-Boox-Nova-Air-C-5.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Nova Air C" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/buq6EuQNRDatmJBKwQjAgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo — who mainly focuses on Apple products and trends — predicted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E5%85%83%E5%A4%AA%E5%8F%AF%E6%9C%9B%E9%A1%AF%E8%91%97%E5%8F%97%E6%83%A0%E6%96%BCamazon%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A9%E8%89%B2%E9%9B%BB%E5%AD%90%E7%B4%99%E8%88%87walmart%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E5%9B%9B%E8%89%B2esl-e-ink-expected-to-benefit-significantly-from-amazons-e458370ee119">Amazon is likely to roll out color E Ink devices</a> as early as 2025. Despite the high cost associated with color e-paper screens, Kuo&apos;s predictions suggest that color Kindles will come with the latest Advanced Color ePaper (ACeP) display.</p><p>Amazon generally plays it very safe with its e-readers, but Kuo&apos;s insight leans towards a potentially risky move. See, the cost of e-paper screens is the most expensive part of any e-paper device. Color e-ink displays cost more than double the price of B&W e-ink screens.</p><p>This means that a color Kindle would probably cost nearly twice as much as a regular old Amazon e-reader and that spells trouble for the brand. One of the major selling points of a Kindle is that it is darn cheap and accessible. Feature-wise, it loses out to competitors like Onyx Boox in nearly every single category except for waterproofing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3210px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zSTRyQjiVK6piJedRd4zqX" name="Amazon-Kindle-2022-review-text-display.jpg" alt="Kindle (2022) display text" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSTRyQjiVK6piJedRd4zqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3210" height="1805" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon limits the potential of its Kindles, filling them with ads and removing access to the Google Play Store. On the other hand, other popular e-readers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> give you unfettered access to the Play Store, and you are free to install whatever app you want. Then there are other factors like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-ink tablets</a> with styli, speakers, a mic, and microSD card slots.</p><p>When such fully-featured e-readers exist, the only reason why people buy Amazon&apos;s limited paper tablets is obviously money. And when an expensive color Kindle rolls around with just as narrow a use case as all the rest of the Kindles, it just won&apos;t make sense to the consumer anymore.</p><p>If you don&apos;t believe me, just take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a>, which comes in at around $340 apiece. For the same amount of money, you can purchase something from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-x-review">Onyx Boox with far superior specs</a> and a stylus that supports better pressure sensitivity levels with unrestricted access to the Play Store. Add a little more money and you can even score one with a color screen.</p><p>There was a lot of talk about a Kindle with a stylus up to its release, but once everyone saw the price of the Scribe, they weren&apos;t as interested anymore. The general consensus is that the device doesn&apos;t deliver much value for money.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3459px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uJp2bfxLpBkot3zHm5QWXX" name="onyx-boox-tab-x-lifestyle-8.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Tab X E Ink tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJp2bfxLpBkot3zHm5QWXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3459" height="1946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the price, the only other factor keeping Kindles at the top is the battery life. As we have tested and discovered time and time again, color e-paper tablets don&apos;t last anywhere near as long as monochrome black-and-white ones.</p><p>Naturally, you won&apos;t be able to squeeze out weeks upon weeks of battery life from a color Kindle, at least not unless you are very miserly with your usage or Amazon bumps up the battery capacity significantly. Neither of those scenarios is optimal because you either sacrifice performance or the price goes up even more because of the larger battery.</p><p>At the end of the day, I am forced to ask a simple question. Who benefits from a color Kindle? Is this even something we want to see? Based on my own judgment, I wouldn&apos;t say so.</p><p>Instead, I would much rather see a Kindle with the Play Store, speakers, more apps, a microSD slot, or something else practical along those lines. Give me fast charging or better stylus support. I want a better Kindle, not the same old thing in color.</p>

<ul><li>A new Samsung patent has reportedly been spotted, detailing a more personal AI summarization feature for Galaxy AI.</li><li>The patent users would be able to tell the AI how long or short they'd like the summary to be and what tone of voice it should use.</li><li>The AI would base its informational responses on a user's search history, preferences, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information has surfaced regarding a new Galaxy AI feature Samsung is currently developing.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2024/03/18/FBLRRYLHZ5ANBBHWO3A5ZXWWHQ/">ChosunBiz</a> (Korean),  Samsung has submitted a patent to the South Korean government detailing an upgraded AI summarization feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-ai-features-are-coming-with-next-gen-foldable-phones/">SamMobile</a>). The KIPRIS patent system states Samsung has designed this feature to provide a more personalized summary experience.</p><p>The AI is said to examine a user&apos;s "usage history" to provide answers appropriately. The patent reportedly adds that the AI will take into account a user&apos;s preference, level of knowledge on various subjects, and more. Additionally, the AI will understand a user&apos;s interests and "non-interests" by using their search history.</p><p>Users may also be able to customize how the AI provides a summary on a given topic. The publication states that Samsung aims for users to tell the AI how long they&apos;d like the summary to be and its tone of voice. An example the Korean OEM provided in its patent reads, "please summarize in a long and negative tone."</p><p>Speculation states Samsung could roll out this new feature on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 later this year. Only time will tell, as this could simply be a feature Samsung playtests but never releases for consumers.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about this "enhanced" AI summarization is that Samsung already rolled out a version of this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. The Galaxy S24 series can summarize lengthy pieces of text, like a document or web page, for users. However, the patent details a feature that may bring a new level of customization to users.</p><p>We&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s23-march-security-patch-2024">still waiting for</a> several Galaxy AI features to arrive on Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, like the S23 series. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-coming-to-older-galaxy-phones">detailed its plans</a> to do so back in January, stating users will gain Circle to Search, live translation, Chat Assist, and the current summary feature. These are slated to arrive with its One UI 6.1 update, which still has yet to roll out.</p><p>If Samsung plans to release this feature in its next clamshell, it could happen in July. A rumor at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">the end of February</a> suggested as much and also purported Samsung could hold its event in Paris, France.</p>
