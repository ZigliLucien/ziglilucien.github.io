The Android 15-based update for the OnePlus 12 is a shining example of what a company can achieve when it realizes its past mistakes and resolves to fix them.</p><p>Now, OnePlus is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">elite few companies</a> that have pushed an Android 15 update out to its phones in less than a month after Google released the OS. Meanwhile, companies like Samsung are saying not to expect its Android 15 beta release for another month, followed by the full release of One UI 7 sometime early in 2025. I would have lost money if I had to wager a bet against which of these two companies would have had its Android 15 update out first.</p><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> user, I'm glad OnePlus got its act together and has been able to deliver such a monumental update in such a short amount of time. OnePlus 12<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review"></a> users can expect to see the update appear on their phones this week, while other OnePlus phones should get the update in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>That's one of the many reasons the OnePlus 12 is a phone you need to consider picking up during Black Friday this year. We've already seen great sales on this phone just this week, with the phone on sale for $649. But if you're willing to wait just 3 weeks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-oneplus-deals">Black Friday OnePlus deals</a>, I think you'll be able to get it for even cheaper.</p><p>I've reviewed well over a dozen phones this year, but the one I keep coming back to is the OnePlus 12. Here's why I think you'll love it, too.</p>

<h2 id="a-refreshing-look-and-feel-2">A refreshing look and feel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX" name="oneplus-12-never-settle-oxygenos-15" alt="Some new lockscreen customization options in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> sports a fresh coat of paint and refined iconography, including a more powerful theme engine that feels closer to OxygenOS's golden days of yore. Not only that, but the company has added in several new features and options that are sure to get some users excited.</p><p>You can now choose to split the notification shade if you want, adding room for more quick toggles in a separate shade from notifications. You can always swipe left or right to move between these panes, so enabling the iOS-style feature is actually more handy than it is on iOS itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uwSYtRtFWLwH6LYYF8SGvX" name="oneplus-12-oxygenos-15-split-notification-quick-toggles" alt="The new split quick toggle option in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwSYtRtFWLwH6LYYF8SGvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of iOS, OnePlus joins the swath of OEMs that have added a Dynamic Island-style pop-up notification to the punch-hole camera in the display, but it's disabled by default. Right now, it doesn't seem to support many apps so it's probably not worth using outside of a few first-party OnePlus apps.</p><p>The new animations and optional frosted glass UI look are all quite beautiful and should please anyone who appreciates little details throughout the UI.</p><p>All of this ties in so perfectly with the haptics which have always been one of the real stars of the show when using the OnePlus 12. Move your finger along the brightness or volume sliders and each little notch is felt like you're moving a dial. Keyboard taps are punchy and deep. Unlocking with the one's excellent fingerprint sensor feels like pressing a button. It's all incredible, and it makes me love using this phone over others.</p>
<h2 id="ai-to-the-rescue-2">AI to the rescue</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RwAuwS2TyzeZC3qt594avX" name="oneplus-12-ai-detail-boost" alt="Using the AI detail boost feature in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwAuwS2TyzeZC3qt594avX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus phones rarely have the best cameras in the industry, but the OnePlus 12 has surprised me more than once with its unique Hasselblad color tuning engine and the excellent telephoto sensor on the back.</p><p>With that said, I wholeheartedly welcome the new AI features that work to make the camera even better. We already tested OnePlus' AI eraser and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-versus-magic-eraser">found that it was better</a> than Google's Magic Eraser, and now OnePlus is back with three other new tools I'll be using all the time.</p><p>AI Detail Boost can help fill in the gaps to make low-resolution images look crisper and cleaner, or just add some more fine detail to an image that's been zoomed into. This one's nice, but I like AI Unblur even better since it can help clean up some of my favorite blurry photos. Check out this comparison of my son and his friends during Halloween, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2jN6GSkvNYGFypvu9eR68C" name="oneplus-ai-deblur-example-01" alt="Deblurring a photo using OxygenOS 15's new AI deblur tool on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jN6GSkvNYGFypvu9eR68C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a reflection eraser tool that does exactly what it says on the tin, similar to the tool that shipped with Samsung phones in 2023.</p><p>Lastly, a new global search app uses Google Gemini to locally catalog anything you give it permission to, including photos, messages, contacts, and more. It's not <em>quite</em> as robust as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> on a Google Pixel, but it can be helpful for quickly finding photos, videos, or messages on your phone without switching between a bunch of apps.</p><p>OnePlus also upgraded the multitasking to make it more like the brilliant OnePlus Canvas software that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. Floating windows now support gestures, the smart sidebar can be used like a desktop dock to launch apps, and switching between apps is faster and smoother than on any other phone, thanks to OnePlus's brilliant UI design.</p><p>There are a lot of other little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">things we've been loving about this update</a> and all of them culminate into an experience that's better than any other phone on the market. I keep coming back to this phone time and time again despite having access to every other Android phone on the market, and I think you will find the same joy if you pick one up for cheap during Black Friday this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>To understand how the tech landscape or anything else would function during a second Donald Trump presidency you first must understand Trump himself. Much ink has been spilled by people with various qualifications about Trump and his flaws, but I think it’s a lot simpler than people make it; Trump is purposefully divisive because he finds humor in the chaos it creates. The man wants to act the way he acts and it’s impossible to tell exactly what he thinks at any point in time. He will say anything to create controversy because he <em>desires</em> controversy. Many people love him for it.</p><p>This trait is also part of his political identity. You may love or loathe the man, but he wants you to manifest those emotions either way. He knows what to say and when to say it for maximum effect, and isn’t shy about it. You don’t know what Trump thinks because that’s not important to him and can change at the drop of a hat. He is the embodiment of the saying that any publicity is good publicity and his time in Hollywood taught him well.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>More importantly, he has learned how to surround himself with sycophants, some of whom <em>can</em> actually bring about change. Regardless of what you may think, the president is not in control of the price of gas or eggs and can’t make any laws. He can only sign laws that Congress has approved. Executive orders can have a limited effect, but the law of the land comes from Congress.</p><p>With Republicans controlling all three branches of government, expect change. Some change you may not like is bound to happen. But this Congress is unpredictable in a way we’ve never seen before because a sizable portion of the elected officials in both the House and Senate will do and say anything to curry favor with Trump and his ardent followers. Trump can say we should ban TikTok on Monday and change his mind on Wednesday. But if Congress bans TikTok on Tuesday to appease Trump, it’s not undone easily. Trump understands that he can act the way he acts, but Congress <em><strong>must</strong></em> be clear on what is best for the country versus what is said for amusement.</p>
<p>A good example would be Trump’s relationship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/twitter-x-could-start-charging-users-subscription-fees">Elon Musk</a>. Today, the two seem to share some common goals and we should expect both to profit from the relationship in some form or another. Much of this will affect U.S. consumers and give Musk’s ventures more leeway and lax oversight. However, this relationship can change at any time because of Trump’s (and Musk’s, to an extent) unpredictable nature. Next week Musk could be the villain Trump, and by association, those who follow him in Congress, want to punish.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.83%;"><img id="Urn3rqngFkZFEkcxyCF5eP" name="tesla-launch.gif" alt="A Tesla driving away." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Urn3rqngFkZFEkcxyCF5eP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ve no doubt read about what to expect for tech companies under Trump across the internet from some reputable sources. My inbox is full of pitches, ideas, and interview offerings from experts on the matter as well.</p><p>I say they all may be right. Also, they all may be wrong. There’s just no telling what we should expect in the future because even the “people in charge” don’t know what to think in the future; Trump hasn’t <em>told</em> them what to think yet.</p>
<p>I’m not saying any of this as someone who opposes (or endorses) the idea of a second Trump presidency; to me, the man is no better or worse than any other successful politician. I’m not a Republican, Democrat, or even an Independent. If I have to apply a label to myself, I’m a Defeatist; I think a ruling class has inserted itself into politics in a way that you either submit and enjoy the enrichment that comes along with it or don’t get elected. Ideally, sowing division among the electorate is the goal to keep anyone who disagrees from ever gaining popularity. Ignoring his personal life, Trump is no better or worse than any other successful politician on the national stage, he's just different. Going by the 2024 election results, plenty of people prefer this sort of governing.</p>
<p>Not counting any personal grievances that make their way into American politics, expect a second Trump term to look a lot like any other administration where Republicans control the government: more friendly to companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, fewer consumer protection laws successfully introduced to Congress, and a short period of economic growth followed by a hard recession. We have the blueprint of how this works, which is readily available.<br><br>As examples, in 2019 DoJ anitrust division head Makan Delrahim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html" target="_blank">actively lobbied regulators and lawmakers</a> to ensure the deal between Sprint and T-Mobile was successful. The Trump administration FTC's lone successful antitrust decision against Qualcomm was sullied when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/the-doj-and-other-federal-agencies-oppose-the-ftc-in-ftc-v-qualcomm#:~:text=At%20that%20time%2C%20the%20DOJ,Department%20of%20Defense%20(DoD)." target="_blank">DoJ intervened against the FTC</a>, filing a motion that defended Qualcomm.

<p>I would not be surprised to see Google prevail in its current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">antitrust cases</a> under a new FTC, Amazon dodges any similar charges, and Meta continues its lawful-evil ways without any oversight. The executives of these companies may decree a Trump presidency as a travesty, but money doesn’t lie and plenty of it will continue to change hands with all levels of the administration, just as it would had Harris defeated Trump.</p><p>Expect Biden’s Executive Order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters">governing AI</a>, which Trump has pledged to repeal, to disappear. With noticeable support from many of the companies covered under this order, there should be little outcry from the tech sector. Congress will also resist creating any new AI regulation.</p>

That didn’t stop Trump from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods or Biden expanding them and economists claim there are loopholes that could be used to apply new tariffs on foreign goods.</p><p>Don’t blindly believe that we’ll be paying hundreds more for tech products because the companies that make them have plenty of influence on lawmakers. Nobody will pay $1,400 for the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S</a> so that simply won’t be the price. Any tariffs and their effects will be mitigated <em>somehow</em>. Let’s hope the solution doesn’t wreak havoc down the road.</p><p>While societal norms and individual rights are going to change, I predict the tech landscape to go mostly the same way it always has, both in the U.S. and abroad, favoring the wealthy donor class over the consumer.</p>

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">report from Counterpoint Research</a>, Google's smartphone shipments grew 20% in Q3 2024, which can be attributed to the much earlier launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p><p>A second report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america/#monthly-202310-202410">Statcounter</a> shows just how drastic Pixel growth has been, with a graph revealing a jump from about 5% to a whopping 14% share between September and October. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series went on sale at the end of August, when there was a noticeable uptick in share, giving Google a good amount of time to see the Pixel 9 affected Q3 sales figures. It's worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> did not go on sale until Q4 2023.</p>
<p>While Google still has some catching up to do to reach the numbers of Samsung Galaxy phones, it's clear that the company's strategy is working. The Pixel 9 series has have been impressive thanks to great cameras, standout designs, a better chipset, and fun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> features.</p>

Now, OnePlus is getting in on the action by rolling out OxygenOS 15 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the company's current global flagship (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is still China-only for now). Some Android Central staff have already received the update, which is steadily arriving on global variants of the phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1723669843116294150">update</a> brings a host of visual improvements to the home screen, themes, and animations and should make things more fluid and uniform throughout the UI. The pulldown menu can now be separated by notifications and quick settings, similar to iPhones and some other Android phones. There's also a new Live Alerts feature that mimics Apple's Dynamic Island by showing real-time updates for apps and activities in an expandable pill at the top of the display.</p><p>There are a ton of new updates, but Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda has highlighted some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">his favorite OxygenOS 15 features</a>.</p>

The device, as hinted by the name, would be a thinner model, but that apparently might not mean that it'll be a watered-down version. A recent leak suggests that despite its thinner profile, the phone may feature an "Ultra" camera.</p><p>While the leak doesn't specify what that means, it's not hard to guess that it could adopt a 200MP camera similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and previous Ultra models. If true, it'll be interesting to see how this will fit in the phone; will it feature a massively protruding camera sensor? We don't know how "slim" this phone will be, but it may likely be thinner than the current batch of Galaxy S24 models, which come in at 7.6, 7.7, and 8.6mm for the S24, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>, and S24 Ultra, respectively.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That’s a fact and not just a guess https://t.co/AAGlsZVOIW<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854787657382957146">November 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's also being said that if the Galaxy S25 Slim does launch, it won't arrive with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, which is expected in January. That said, it's not clear when Samsung is planning to launch the device if it does end up coming to market.</p>

However, as exciting as it seems, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> has already encountered some problems, with owners complaining about a yellow tint at the bottom of the display that bleeds into about an inch of the screen. Not only that, but apparently, the dark mode is not working on the device.</p><p>The problem has led to plenty of low reviews on Amazon, with the device sitting at an average of 2.6 stars. With Amazon well aware of the issue, the company is working on a fix and noting that owners can contact customer service and request a replacement or refund. That said, replacements may take some time to arrive as Amazon works on fixing the screen tint issues, although there's no word on the dark mode issue.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The 'Saved' tab is being replaced by an 'Activity' tab that brings everything together in one place, including search history from Chrome and the Google app.</li><li>The update will simplify things by creating a single spot for your search history and saved items, instead of having them scattered across different tabs.</li><li>The change is in a limited test phase, with only a few users getting it so far, and has been in development for the past two months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s working on a new feature to make accessing your search history and saved items easier right from the main app.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-app-activity-tab-3497741/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google’s main app is getting a big update. The current "Saved" tab will be swapped out for a new "Activity" tab that pulls together all your saved items in one spot. Furthermore, it’ll give you easy access to your search history from both Chrome and the Google app.</p><p>At present, checking your History on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> and the Google app can be a hassle, with information spread across different tabs. That said, with this experiment, Google is making that job easier by creating a unified spot to access both your search history and saved items.</p><p>Google is rolling out the new feature as a test, with only a limited number of users getting it so far. According to Android Authority contributor Assemble Debug, it’s been in the works for the past two months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:229px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.90%;"><img id="Zf5W9UaWgC6avhH2yVUKQo" name="Google-app-activity-tab" alt="Google app's new activity tab in testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zf5W9UaWgC6avhH2yVUKQo.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="229" height="499" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new "Activity" tab gives you a seamless, app-based experience instead of a web view. Plus, you’ll be able to easily save, share, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-delete-your-recent-google-search-history-on-android">delete history items</a> right from the app.</p><p>A Telegram user, @andrey4ik21pro1_q, found the new 'Activity' tab on their Pixel 8 Pro with Google app version 15.44.25.29.arm64. However, it seems that the feature wasn’t available on another Pixel 8 Pro running a newer version of the app.</p><p>The feature is expected to roll out more widely in the coming weeks, so users should be able to access it soon.</p>

Best Buy's not making anyone wait that long, as its early Black Friday deal is already underway. And as part of one of the first "Doorbusters," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p?skuId=6587911"><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been discounted</strong></a> to its lowest price ever!</p><p>When I wrapped up my review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I just assumed that I would swap my SIM card back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Surprisingly, that hasn't been the case, and the 9 Pro Fold remains right by my side every day. And at the very least, I implore you to try out Google's latest foldable phone for yourself, especially considering that it's $300 off.</p>

<p>If that comes as a surprise to you, you're not the only one. Samsung has a more robust software experience, while also doing a better job with handling aspect ratios. But there's just something about the 9 Pro Fold that keeps me coming back.</p><p>Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that this is basically the phone that I hoped Google would've released as a first iteration. While the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> offers a neat design, it's far from refined. However, the 9 Pro Fold solves practically all of my complaints from last year, with a few added benefits.</p><p>I've spoken about this a few times, but as someone who is a first-time father, I've quickly learned that sometimes I need a bit of help to get my son's attention for a picture. The one feature that I keep coming back to is "Made You Look," which not only gets my son's attention but usually makes him smile.</p>

<p>It's already come in handy more times than I can count, and with the holiday season rapidly approaching, I suspect this number will grow exponentially. Not to mention that the 9 Pro Fold will also probably act as the "group family picture" camera, as it's easy to prop it up, set a timer, and snap the picture after I jump in.</p><p>But in the event that I'm not actually able to get in the picture, Google has the solution for that. Although I don't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and the various AI features all of the time, I know that they're ready for whenever I am. This includes the "Add Me" feature, so I can snap a picture of the family, then have someone else take one of me, and just add me to the shot.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not the perfect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, but I don't even know if such a thing exists. There are trade-offs to be found, no matter what phone you end up deciding on. But one thing I know for sure is that if I didn't already have the 9 Pro Fold, I'd be picking one up.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest major AI venture has exited testing and it becoming available for more Workspace users.</p><p>The company highlighted the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available.html">general availability</a>" of its AI-backed video creation app, Google Vids. The post states users can "easily build" videos by leveraging its AI model Gemini for assistance. The app has generative AI features through its new "help me create" button. One standout function of Google Vids is its selection of templates.</p><p>Clicking "help me create" will reportedly produce Gemini's assistance based on your work. Google states its AI software can suggest a "script" for use or to serve as inspiration.</p><p>The templates Google alluded to are "use-based," meaning Workspace users may find the design they prefer to use in ads, meetings, and more. On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15082957">support page</a>, the company states that users can find these templates within the sidebar. These templates deliver a frame from which users can build off of. Google states users can choose different animations, transitions, and more.</p><p>The post adds that users will find a built-in recording studio when creating videos. From there, Workspace users can record themselves, a narration, a screen recording, or audio. However, Google Vids leans heavily on AI assistance, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15067217?sjid=16528034210924596463-NC">Gemini can create a voice-over</a> for you. The company states this feature is available at the bottom of the script panel.</p>

<p>Google then extends a warning to Workspace users interested in the Vids app. While it is expanding to "select" subscription plans, "AI-powered features like 'help me create' and AI voice-overs" remain free until December 31, 2025. The company states a "limit" may be applied to such features by 2026, but it will provide a follow-up alert around that time if it's happening.</p><p>The Google Vids expansion includes Workspace Business (Standard/Plus), Enterprise (Standard/Plus), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available-for-edu.html">Education Plus</a>, Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus. Moreover, a Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, or Education Premium add-on will find Google Vids.</p><p>The feature has started making its rounds and its rollout should be completed within 15 days.</p><p>Google first debuted its Vids app for Workspace during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-cloud-next-2024-gen-ai-announcements">Cloud Next 2024</a> event in April. This was followed up with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">testing phase</a> that kicked off this past summer. The company detailed Google Vids as an AI-backed tool to assist with generating storyboards alongside a wealth of editing/stylizing options. What's more, Gemini was stated to offer more suggestions when you can't decide between stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Additionally, Google Vids provides a "View and Collaborate" function. This lets other users (with a Workspace account) come in and work with you on a project. There is an option to "create and copy;" however, Google states this is available to "select editions."</p>

I adore its size and the fact that it comes in a wide array of unique color options. Luckily, this already-affordable outdoor speaker usually costs around $80, but this pre-Black Friday deal brings it down to a lowly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTP56C5R"><strong>$49.93 on Amazon</strong></a> for a limited time.</p><p>JBL is famously reliable in the audio accessory world.

The Clip 5 only costs $50 with this deal, which is tough to beat.</p><p>Although the Clip 5 only has a 10W sound output, it sounds really loud and maintains its sound quality at maximum volume levels. I don&apos;t need to tell you how good this JBL speaker sounds; you probably already heard about the brand&apos;s signature audio quality. There are nine different patterns and colorways to pick from, including a cool cameo print which is perfect for the outdoors.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Photos app to help users stay in the loop with all the latest happenings.</p><p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/306428786?hl=en">a community post</a>, Google is rolling the new "Updates" page in Photos for all users on Android and iOS. This new page is being touted as a shared, social hub for people who share photo albums with one another. Accessible via a new "bell icon," users will find an Updates page that places organization and what's current first.</p><p>Google states it hopes the Updates page can "foster collaboration and connection." This is designed to be a user's one-stop-shop for updates on shared albums and conversations/group conversations. Regarding the latter, the post states users will be notified if they're added to a new conversation or if another user sends a new photo. All conversations are accessible via the Photos app settings.</p><p>For shared albums, Google says its Updates area will inform you of new ones and display them in the order received. Moreover, if another user adds a new picture to a shared album, an alert will be sent so you can check it out. However, users can hop into their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections tab</a> to view their shared albums without seeing ongoing conversations and "other activities."</p><p>Other information in this new page include partner sharing, memory, and storage updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8" name="google-photos-2022-dark-mode.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google highlights the "chronological" order of the Updates page. Albums received/shared will be displayed by "today" first, before diving into "yesterday, this week, this month" and more.</p><p>As previously stated, the Updates page in Photos is rolling out today (Nov 8). The company states that users can continue to check for an update "over the coming weeks."</p><p>Speaking of the "Collections" tab, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">the "Library" tab revamp</a> for the app over the summer. Instead of that old carousel, users were presented with a more organized grid for their cloud-stored albums. The company also shifted the Locked Folder button down into a list, instead of being displayed as a larger pill-shaped button up top.</p><p>With the "Updates" page arriving, we're still waiting on the official rollout of the app's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature. Google Photos will soon let users conversate with an AI to discover photos they're having trouble locating. "Ask Photos" leverages the company's AI model Gemini to process your "descriptive query" and (hopefully) find what you're looking for. Google highlighted the feature in September, stating users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">join its waitlist</a> to try it out before it launches.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening is the horror game I didn't know I needed. I say that because, first off, I'm not exactly a fan of the horror genre. I've enjoyed the occasional scary movie or game from time to time, but those are exceptions rather than the rule. I've also never really gotten into the Metro series despite enjoying the theme and the original release of Metro 2033.</p><p>But Metro Awakening is something special. It's a narrative-heavy, linear first-person shooter — just like the rest of the series — that had me hooked from the moment its clever intro began. It's also the first made-for-VR entry into the storied series, developed entirely by veteran VR developer Vertigo Games, the same company behind VR classics like Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall.</p><p>Despite being from a different developer, Metro Awakening feels incredibly similar to Metro 2033 in all the right ways. As the story goes, it takes place primarily in the metro train tunnels under a once great city, where you'll find yourself uncovering the horrors that both radioactivity and desperate humans created. It's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> I've ever played.</p>

<p>If you've played the Arizona Sunshine games or After the Fall, you'll immediately feel familiar with the mechanics in Metro Awakening. That's not to say things are identical — the dual backpack-based inventory system is a clever new design I haven't seen yet — but everything that's good about the company's previous apocalyptic shooters sits on display for players to experience in Metro Awakening.</p><p>Intuitive on-body inventory systems, where you can consistently depend on grabbing the same item every time you reach for it, make them feel as good as a hot bar in a flat-screen game.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is particularly important given the level of fear the game consistently holds you in, as you'll be able to make better split-second decisions because you won't be fumbling with an unreliable inventory system. Healing is always on your left hip, a pistol always on your right, and reaching into the pocket on your chest always delivers the proper ammo or refill for the weapon you're holding.</p><p>That is, of course, so long as you've been able to hold on to enough ammo to get you through the next section. One of Metro Awakening's biggest strengths is its consistent difficulty level, which is directly relative to how much ammo you're given between any of the game's encounters.</p><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>While running from a giant mutant rat, I grabbed a large sliding door and closed it three-quarters of the way, blocking the rat's entry and giving me enough space to blast it to smithereens.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Metro Awakening's combat encounters are as often about taking the stealthy approach as they are about blindly shooting at unseen enemies like a character in one of Ridley Scott's Alien movies. Most encounters with humans give you the option to be stealthy — which I'll encourage you to use — in order to save up as much ammo for the next encounter as possible.</p><p>But every single encounter — even the ones that very obviously imply a stealthy approach is best — can be run through Rambo style. Enemies' weapons can be taken after they are downed, and while ammo in those weapons is always severely limited, they allow skilled players to hop from enemy to enemy and piggyback in creative ways. Cans and bottles can be brought from place to place and used to distract enemies, so you can use a stealthy melee attack to take them out.</p><p>The ability to act naturally in VR dawned on me during one early encounter. While running from a giant mutant rat, I grabbed a large sliding door and closed it three-quarters of the way, blocking the rat's entry and giving me enough space to blast it to smithereens.</p><p>There's no way to do this in a non-VR game, and it makes the game feel special and bespoke in a way that another flatscreen entry couldn't.</p>

<p>There was never a time in Metro Awakening's 12-hour campaign where I felt like I was repeating the same old situation over and over again. Each hallway, air vent, metro tunnel, or other space you walk through feels unique in a way that's rarely achieved outside of something as good as Metroid Prime. While this isn't a Metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination, the variety of locales and the compelling story kept me coming back to the game for more each day.</p><p>Metro Awakening has you playing the community's doctor whose eccentric wife seems to always cause problems. When she starts hearing the voice of your long-dead son in the steam pipes, you know something bad's about to happen. The rest of the journey will have you wondering if she's sane, prophetic, or maybe somewhere in between the two. Either way, you'll be venturing further than your character's hard past has ever gone before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD" name="metro-awakening-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot of Metro Awakening taken on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since many parts of the world you'll explore are radioactive, you'll need to occasionally put on a gas mask and keep track of how effective its filter is working. Finding and swapping out filters will let you explore these areas more, often helping you find survival supplies and a few collectible items. If there's any replayability in the game, it's for folks who love to re-experience specific events or to find all three postcards hidden in each chapter.</p><p>Despite not being a big fan of the horror genre, the macabre scenes depicted constantly throughout the game were fascinating in a way I didn't expect. Likewise, the horrifying creatures that had me jumping and blindly shooting were always interesting to encounter, and I regularly tried to find creative ways to dispatch them before they got too close.</p><p>While I wouldn't put Metro Awakening in the same general category as a horror game like Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife, there's no denying the importance of horror to the story and the overall atmosphere of the game. Even if you're not a fan of horror like me, I'd encourage you to try it. The Meta Quest store has a 2-hour return window, anyway, and you'll definitely get the feeling of the game in the first 30 minutes, let alone two hours.</p>

<p>If I had to name one specific critique of the Quest version of the game, it would be that I expected to see the game running at a higher resolution than it does. I used Quest Games Optimizer to boost the resolution to 130%, and it looked downright breathtaking at times, all without any noticeable performance hitches. Hopefully, Vertigo Games can patch in something like this soon.</p><p>The VR community has had its share of ups and downs with big releases this year, but this last quarter has proven to pack a serious punch that gives me high hopes for the future of big-name VR games. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> sits firmly at the top as game of the year, although Metro Awakening has already making me question which title will get the crown at the end of the year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola rolled out its typical pair of foldables this summer; however, there might be another addition on the horizon.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50s-ultra-design-specifications-sgs-fimko-wireless-consortium/">91Mobiles</a>, the upcoming Motorola Razr 50s Ultra (XT2451-6) was spotted picking up its Wireless Power Consortium certification. Previous speculation theorized Motorola would keep the device close to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr (2023)</a>, but this listing shows a more current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus (2024)</a> theme.</p><p>The company's imagery shows a large cover display, likely in the 4-inch realm like the latest Plus model.</p><p>The display seems mostly the same, meaning consumers could see a cheaper Razr 50s Ultra with 6.9-inch display. A centered, punch-hole selfie camera remains present and the screen's bezels seem relatively thin like the recent 2024 series. The publication purports the device's rear panel features a textured leather finish. Other details in its imagery reveal the device may debut with its physical power and volume buttons on the right side of the frame.</p><p>The WPC certification appearance highlighted the device's 15W of wireless charging strength. Moreover, the publication noticed the device rolling through the SGS Fumiko certification database with 44W of wired charging. Additionally, the device's model number was listed alongside five other theoretical "variants."</p><p>It's unclear what these variants could mean — or even look like. We're also still wondering about a possible launch timeframe, which is still uncertain.</p>

Rumors of the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rumored-affordable-razr-50s-foldable-certification">originally surfaced in September</a> as it was passing through the HDR10+ certification database. Seeing as it appeared there, speculation sided with the possibility of a 10-bit color display. More importantly, the "S" attachment was curious and pushed reports to believe it marked a "cheaper" device.</p><p>Curiously, this certification discovery comes <em>after </em>the "Motorola Razr 50s Ultra" reportedly debuted in Japan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/motorola-razr-50s-has-been-announced-kind-of.html">Android Headlines</a>, the device was listed officially with SoftBank, a Japanese wireless service provider. The publication states that Motorola didn't announce this device itself. Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.softbank.jp/mobile/products/smartphone/motorola-razr-50s/">it launched on September 27</a>. This creates a rather murky narrative, considering the recent certification appearance.</p><p>The report from 91Mobiles states that two of the recent Moto Razr 50s Ultra variants appear under the company's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/about/hearing-aid-compatibility-us?srsltid=AfmBOooAvCUTnUIjfpLDo-1IO0Km211MEmedbfZkjh7owdvxIzjGFngF">Hearing Aid</a>" compatibility page. So, perhaps we're looking at an eventual U.S. market launch, but don't hold your breath.</p><p>Motorola's latest foldable duo launched this past June and the Plus edition continued the large cover display trend from 2023. The company improved its usefulness while also enhancing its cameras and software. With rumors suggesting this "S" variant of the flagship models could sit beneath them, it remains to be seen what we'll have to sacrifice.</p>

Its large 4-inch cover display has become more useful than before alongside improvements to its software. Moreover, the included Snapdragon chip makes for a snappy, smooth performing foldable.</p></p>
