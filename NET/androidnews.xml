                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi is onto a winner with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">15 Ultra</a>; I used the phone for well over a month, and it is absolutely fantastic. There's a new design that makes it easier to hold and use, a bigger battery, the same great 1-inch main camera as last year but with a new 200MP tele lens that takes outstanding portraits alongside 4.3x zoom, and the latest available hardware. <br><br>Xiaomi debuted the device globally at Mobile World Congress, and the 15 Ultra is now making its way to India, where it is sold in a single 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹109,999 ($1,259). As always, Xiaomi India is incentivizing the launch by providing freebies — including the excellent photography kit that's bundled with all pre-orders. The phone is ₹10,000 costlier than the 14 Ultra in India, and that's understandable when you look at all the upgrades. <br><br>Even then, it is a considerable bargain when you consider the same phone is sold in the U.K. for £1,499 ($1,932), and other countries in the region for €1,499 ($1,627). Xiaomi has always been aggressive when it comes to India, and that's the case with the 15 Ultra as well, and if you're interested in the phone, India is the best country to pick it up. I'd argue that it's better to buy the 15 Ultra in India than China — even though it's more affordable in Xiaomi's home market — because the Indian model comes with the Play Store and all Google services out of the box.</p>

<p>Best of all, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra undercuts the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India. The Galaxy S25 Ultra costs ₹141,999 ($1,626) in the country for the 16GB/512GB edition, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is ₹139,999 ($1,603) for the 512GB option. Although the 15 Ultra costs more than last year, it is still the best value (as it were) if you want a high-end phone in India, and there's also the fact that it has the absolute best camera package of any device today. <br><br>As I noted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Xiaomi 15 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> post, Xiaomi managed to deliver a better overall product than Samsung this year, and the icing on the cake is that the phone costs less in India. In every other region, the 15 Ultra is being sold at a premium over the S25 Ultra, so it's clear that Xiaomi is intent on gaining a foothold in the premium segment in India. <br><br>Xiaomi also debuted the regular Xiaomi 15 in India, and like last year, it does a good job going up against the likes of the OnePlus 13. Although Xiaomi does really well in the budget and now mid-range categories, it hasn't really made a dent in the high-end, and it will be aiming to change that with the 15 Ultra and Xiaomi 15.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A subtle send button change has been spotted on Google Messages; it now darkens when you type, adding a bit of visual feedback.</li><li>Unread messages now stand out more, with bigger profile pictures making them easier to spot.</li><li>The heart reaction might soon be replaced with a thumbs-up when you double-tap on a message.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages just keeps rolling out new UI tweaks. After a busy stretch of updates, the company appears to be working on fresh changes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-ui-changes-2-3533559/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a small but noticeable tweak in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>: the send button shifts to a darker shade once you start typing. It’s not a game-changer, but if you’re a regular user, you’ll probably pick up on it right away.</p><p>This under-the-radar tweak is meant to make typing feel a bit more responsive, especially for those who might struggle with visual cues. As for when it’ll hit everyone’s app is still up in the air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.20%;"><img id="dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4" name="Google-Messages-send-button-dark" alt="Google Messages send button turning dark as you begin to type" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dq2Nn9qZumgBCg58L7tSs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, there are a couple more tweaks in the mix. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j7ouwf/why_are_some_profile_pictures_bigger/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> pointed out that profile pictures for unread messages are now bigger.</p><p>It looks like Google is trying to make unread chats stand out more than just slapping on bold text. This could be a handy visual cue if you’re skimming through a busy inbox.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.37%;"><img id="b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF" name="Google-Messages-profile-pictures" alt="profile pictures are bigger for unread messages on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b33z83F3QeTsrAaMZKoSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1040" height="503" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Affectionate_Mall_53 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, it looks like Google is tweaking the default double-tap gesture in Messages, as per a separate post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1j5vnmn/double_tap_now_thumbs_up_not_heart/?rdt=37455" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Right now, it triggers a heart emoji, but word on the street is that the tech giant is swapping it out for a thumbs-up instead.</p><p>Prior to these, Google has been on a roll with tweaks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-read-receipts-placement-redesign-spotted">fiddled with read receipts</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-search-ui-change-apk-teardown-3528033/" target="_blank">revamped the search bar</a>, and even spruced up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-animation-3530857/" target="_blank">how message bubbles look</a>. It also introduced a new animation for incoming texts.</p>

<p>The alert slider has been so popular that OnePlus's sister company, OPPO, has outfitted several phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find X8 Pro,</a> with one.</p><p>Lau's post talked about how great the alert slider has been over the years, but that praise was suffused with the idea that the alert slider was somehow "old" feeling and needed to be replaced with a newer, better idea. Thus, the company has considered swapping out the three-way slider — which is the easiest way to switch between silent, vibrate, and ring modes on any phone to date — with a programmable button.</p><p>The programmable button concept has become popular with phone makers since Apple launched its Action Button on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> in 2023. The most recent Android spin on the concept can be found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> series, where Nothing made it function as an AI key for advanced screenshots and voice notes.</p><p>While Lau's idea of adding an action button is great — it's always nice to have more customizable options on complicated modern phones — the simplicity of the alert slider is what makes it so perfect. Replacing the alert slider is simply the wrong thing to do.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>OnePlus says it's listening to feedback and wants to hear your opinion. Now's the time to voice it!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The alert slider makes it easy to know what sound mode your OnePlus phone is on with a simple glance. It's just as easy to switch between modes without ever having to turn on your screen or unlock the phone, and, for me, that's very important. I like my phone to make noise when I receive a notification. I miss notifications too easily otherwise, but it's not always appropriate for them to make noise.</p><p>While every phone has a silent or vibrate-only mode, no other modern phone makes it as easy to switch between these modes as OnePlus. This is a feature I use every single day, all throughout the day, and it's one of the reasons I use a OnePlus phone as my main device.</p><p>The silver lining here is that we're not expecting a new OnePlus phone for another several months. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 14</a> isn't expected until Q4 2025 at the earliest, which means there's potentially still time for OnePlus to reverse course before it makes a grave error. If you care about the alert slider and want to see it stick around, head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214?irclickid=VGL2ESXUZxyKR2fx4DXsTSE3Uks1lwwFr3x-U40">the post on the OnePlus Community</a> and put your two cents in.</p><p>OnePlus, please don't replace the alert slider. We love it, and so do your fans. An action button is fine, but not in place of something that's already great. OnePlus has long been a brand "about the community" and says it's listening to feedback. This is the time to test that claim and see if it's true.</p>

<hr>
<p>Monday blues just got way too real for X, as people have been unable to access the app since morning.</p><p>X seems to be down for several across the globe. Several users reported to Downdetector that the app went down at around 5 am on Monday (March 10).</p><p>Users across several countries weren't able to view posts on the app as well as the website,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.ca/status/twitter/"> according to Downdetector</a>. It seems like the outage was on and off, as several users reported that the platform was back to functioning as usual before facing an outage again in a couple of minutes.</p><p>When users tried accessing the platform, they were shown a screen that said, "Something went wrong. Try re-loading." Android Central's staff also faced similar issues, with Nick Sutrich, who was unaware of the outage at the time and thought it could've been his network connection. He said, "I didn't even get an error, it just never loads sometimes."</p><p>According to DownDetector, 58% of users in the U.S. and 56% of folks in Canada continue to experience an outage with the app. If you see the graph below, there have been several points of peaking and equally low dips, indicating that the company is working hard to trace the source of this issue and possibly working on a fix.</p>

<p>At its peak, there were about 42,000 reports of the service being inaccessible, stated Downdetector.</p><p>After several hours, CEO Elon Musk took to the platform<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1899149509407473825"> to confirm </a>that X is under a "massive cyberattack," that could have caused the outage.</p><p>"We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.  Tracing …," Musk's post stated.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems like the service is slowly returning to normal for a few users in Canada, who are now able to view and put out new posts on X.</p><p><em>This is a developing story...</em></p>

Following that release, the succeeding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> also supported 15W wireless charging.

<p>My expectations were super high with the new Nothing phones. Some might even say unreasonably high, but why shouldn't they be? Smartphones are extremely, outrageously, unapologetically fun these days. They can fold in halves and threes, survive rounds in the dishwasher, and even be transparent!</p><p>Nothing took a bold risk that paid off with its insanely cool see-through Android phones that come with LEDs baked into the back. It's this courage to try something unique, even if not entirely practical, that gave me hope to see Qi2 on an affordable, transparent Android phone.</p><p>Even if the Phone 3a and 3a Pro don't have Qi2, I'm still going to hold out hope for the Phone 3. Can you imagine how futuristic a magnetic transparent smartphone would look like? And don't even get me started on the accessories.</p><p>The brand does accessories really well, bringing that transparent, techy aesthetic to earbuds. More impressively, Nothing succeeded in creating a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">functional modular Android phone</a> where companies like Google previously failed. This shows promise.</p>

<p>According to an allegedly leaked email from the CEO of Nothing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">Phone 3 is rumored to launch</a> in the first quarter of this year. I'm shifting gears and turning my gaze towards the future. I can't wait to see what Carl Pei has in store for us.</p><p>A clear phone with lights encased in a glass back is unique enough — now picture a Qi2 coil incorporated into that blueprint. Nothing will probably do all that and still maintain the water and dust-proof integrity of the device. It's going to be an epic phone if it matches my imagination.</p><p>You can't have a see-through magnetic phone without companion accessories. I love anything MagSafe or Qi2, so my number one want from the brand is a transparent Qi2 power bank. Guess what? I'm not alone in my musings.</p>

<p>A user named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/4842-nothing-qi2-battery-pack-concept-battery-1/4">3DPrintedCat took to the Nothing Community forum</a> to share their mockup conceptual renders of what a Nothing Qi2 wireless power bank would look like. They decided to dub it the "Battery (1)," which is right on the money when it comes to Nothing's branding.</p><p>The product concept is sleek, minimal, and highly modern. The clean white ensemble and circular lights inside the Qi2 coil have me drooling. Flat metal sides look so flattering on power banks and battery packs. It's impressive how this fan-made "Battery (1)" concept is so in sync with Nothing's design language.</p>
<p>If Carl Pei does not deliver on such expectations, it's not just me who's going to be very let down. Clearly, many fans are also dying to see such an evolutionary product from Nothing.</p><p>The first quarter of 2025 is almost up, so if the rumors are true, we'll find out very soon whether the Nothing Phone 3 launch will meet our expectations or fail to deliver.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's next foldable is expected some time this year and the newest rumor ignites hope for a very important upgrade.</p><p>The company's upcoming clamshell, the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra/Razr Plus 2025, was spotted passing through the 3C Certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/835/820.htm">ITHome</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/03/motorola-razr-60-ultra-might-come-with-faster-wired-charging-support.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device was spotted with model number XT2551-3, which is pretty much in line with previous database appearances. However, this time, the next Razr Plus was listed with a notable upgrade to its wired charging.</p><p>According to the listing, the next Moto Razr Plus features a stronger 68W wired charger.</p><p>There is something to note here as the publication highlights the charger's "support" for 68W fast charging. The post throws caution to the wind about this, stating there's a possibility Motorola won't push the adapter to its maximum. It reiterates that the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> was also spotted with a similar spec; however, it didn't happen. Instead, as we've seen since its debut last spring, Motorola opted to continue 45W wired charging like the previous edition.</p><p>For now, it might be best to take this with a grain of salt and see what Motorola does officially later this year.</p>

<p>Murmurings about the Moto Razr 50 Ultra or Razr Plus 2025 were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">heard in January</a> when the device supposedly appeared in the BIS database. It was rumored that the foldable could launch earlier this year, considering its certification appearance was in January. It's speculated the device could land three months later, potentially in April, so we'll have to see.</p><p>Meanwhile, a huge Razr Plus 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look">rendering leak</a> purports a similar design vibe for the clamshell. Consumers may see a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch OLED cover screen like its 2024 counterpart. A 4,000mAh battery is also rumored to arrive to keep users powered throughout the day.</p><p>The leaks continue to speculate on Motorola's SoC of choice. This is where things differ as one side claims the (leaked) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a> could power it while others claim the flagship 8 Elite will get the part. The 8s Elite is rumored to be a toned-down variant of the more premium chip with a 1+3+2+2 array like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. That one Prime core could clock in at 3.21GHz.</p><p>Motorola made a similar tier-down SoC move with the 2024 Razr Plus, so it's not entirely outlandish, but moving forward accordingly.</p>

<ul><li>Google is starting to rollout an update for Gmail that delivers better Gemini integration between it and the Calendar app.</li><li>Users should soon find an "add to calendar" button if the AI detects important dates and times within an email.</li><li>Adding it is easy, and users will have the choice to edit the AI's added event in case more details are required.</li><li>Google recently updated Calendar with its own dedicated Gemini side panel, which helps users see their week's schedule and add/create events.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out a QoL (quality of life) update for Gmail's Gemini integration that makes important information easier to handle.</p><p>The update was announced via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/add-events-to-google-calendar-using-gemini-in-gmail.html">Workspace blog post</a> with Google highlighting Gemini's presence at the heart of this new feature. The post states that within an email, there will be an "Add to Calendar" button with Gemini's star beside it. This option will appear as the AI briefly searches a received email for dates before highlighting its availability to mark it, if it's of importance.</p><p>Clicking "add to" will produce Gmail's AI assistance side panel. This panel simulates a conversation with Gemini as it explains what it's done. As an example, the AI will state that it's created an event within your calendar for a "Field Visit" on a specific date and time. Gemini will show a link to your calendar with the event's title and date/time, as well as a pencil icon (edit icon).</p><p>Users should be able to make any changes or toss in any additions through this method.</p><p>Google notes a few things of importance: the feature is only available for Gmail on the web (for English users) and using the AI to add an event to Calendar "will not include guests." Also, Gemini's automatic add button won't appear for "already extracted events like flights, restaurants, etc."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1007px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.58%;"><img id="7LNs6kJZSZjhLP6KPcJe8R" name="google-gmail-gemini-add-to-calendar-rollout" alt="Google's Gemini update for Gmail brings an "add to calendar" button for automatic event adding." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LNs6kJZSZjhLP6KPcJe8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1007" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The availability of this feature is restricted to Workspace Business and Enterprise users with the starter, standard, or plus plans. Gemini Education and Education Premium add-on users will see this, too, alongside Google One AI Premium holders. The post says the rollout will be completed by mid-April for users on rapid and scheduled release domains.</p><p>This update, incorporating a better relationship between Gmail and Calendar through Gemini arrives shortly after the latter gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendars-web-client-gains-a-gemini-in-workspace-side-panel">a dedicated AI side panel</a>. In a support document, Google highlights Gemini in Calendar can help users in a variety of ways, from checking your schedule to making new notes. After opening the panel, users can "Ask" Gemini to check the current week's schedule, to which it'll return its high moments.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Create" command lets users tell Gemini to create or add a weekly run, a lunch date, or commute blocks.</p><p>Bringing a side panel with Gemini to the Calendar app on the web is part of Google's mission as stated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">during its initial Labs</a> test last year. Leveraging Gemini 1.5 Pro, the AI is tailored to assist users in apps like Gmail, Docs, Calendar, and more with tasks related to those specific destinations.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's smartphones are dealing with some annoying issues following its latest monthly security patch, per its users.</p><p>Bug reports appeared like wildfire on Google's Pixel subreddit over the weekend as users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j7v479/random_brightness_drop_playing_a_video/">voiced frustrating problems</a> after the March security update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/google-pixel-march-2025-update-display-brightness-bug/">9to5Google</a>). Users reported a "random brightness drop" issue after watching a video on their Pixel 8 Pro. According to the post, their 8 Pro's display would being flickering and they'd suffer an "abrupt brightness drop" roughly "every 10 seconds."</p><p>They add that this issue is occurring every time they watch anything concerning videos, think Netflix or Prime Video, as the post states. The user notes other reports on the subreddit involve devices ranging from the Pixel 7 series to the latest Pixel 9.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j77exv/multiple_bugs_after_march_feature_update/">user's report</a> breaks things down a little more, but begins by reiterating a similar "brightness fluctuation" during a Netflix session. However, the user highlights another issue, one that's plaguing their Pixel's audio. There's reportedly a strange issue appearing with the device's EQ is enabled. The user has noted odd audio shifts, i.e, songs are much louder than videos, making balance hard to come by.</p><p>For now, there's no fix on any of these issues, but one user clocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j7v479/comment/mh01d3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">a potential remedy</a>. If your Pixel display is bugging out, the post suggests dropping your screen's fresh rat to 60Hz, instead of leaving it at 120Hz.</p>

<p>Aside from display woes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-vibrates-too-hard-march-update-3532351/">Android Authority</a> noticed Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3nzrf/haptics_became_stronger_after_march_update/?rdt=64519">users reporting</a> problems with unusually strong device vibrations. These issues started appearing shortly after Google's March security update last week, so it seems this can be lumped into the ongoing problems, too.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3nzrf/comment/mgl3xbe/?share_id=EOf8fm23qkNd9-kuLwMwQ">cites a statement</a> from Google about the issue, which says, "The Pixel team is actively looking into reports from some Pixel users about changes to haptic intensity. To adjust your vibration settings, you can go to Settings > Sound & vibration > Vibration & haptics." Seems like another temporary fix to hold users over for the time being. It's expected that Google will rollout a secondary patch to solve these problems, but when that will happen is anyone's guess.</p><p>Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">March 2025 security update</a> last week shortly after its major feature drop for Pixels. Users may want to exercise caution, considering the recent wave of problems plaguing a host of devices. The patch includes bug fixes for the entire Pixel lineup, including its foldables and tablet, for networking communication, camera, and audio problems.</p><p>Of course, this update came second to Google's massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March feature drop</a> for Pixels. The company rolled out enhanced scam detection for phone calls and text messages and finally dropped Loss of Pulse detection on the Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<ul><li>Pete Lau says that the new button is going to be designed to offer an intuitive and customizable experience while keeping the original sound-switching capabilities.</li><li>OnePlus also notes that it will actively seek user input to shape the button's features.</li><li>It appears the company is drawing parallels with developments like Nothing’s Essential Key and Apple’s Action Button, and we can expect more AI capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus has announced that it is replacing the traditional Alert Slider, which has been on the company’s flagship phones since their inception, with an all-new button.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734468772149854214">According to Pete Lau</a>, the new button is designed to be more personalized, which is also not just smart but also “incredibly intuitive” and “future-ready.” He also reassures users that they will still be able to switch sound profiles on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus handsets</a> without waking the phone, similar to what the existing Alert Slider does. The new button aims to keep the best parts of it and unlock new possibilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="CqxQB7dsjBDWJwwmwxd2kd" name="oneplus-replacing-alert-slide" alt="OnePlus bringing a new customizable button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CqxQB7dsjBDWJwwmwxd2kd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lau reiterates that Alert Slider has always been his favorite feature on the OnePlus phones, which is why it has been brought to Oppo devices. However, over time, it eventually became a “huge piece of hardware” with minimal functionality, i.e. to just switch sound profiles. Lau further notes that It wasn’t also reprogrammable due to its limitations.</p><p>And, it appears it was one of the reasons to remove it from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review">OnePlus 10T</a>, which, however, received a severe backlash — and was later brought back in succeeding phones, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The company's co-founder further shares that he wants to hear from consumers about the new button and what they'd like it to do— further enhancing their daily handset usage experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX" name="oneplus-12-never-settle-oxygenos-15" alt="Some new lockscreen customization options in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLvRdMrhJdAAySkgoVRevX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus acknowledges that it is indeed a big change for long-time enthusiasts and reassures that it is not just about replacing the Alert Slider but rather evolving it with new capabilities.</p><p>On the whole, OnePlus’ approach should likely be similar to what Nothing has recently done with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a series</a> that now has a new Essential Key button, which has some AI-powered capabilities to get things done.</p><p>Samsung has also tried earlier to incorporate a new dedicated Bixby, which was, however, discontinued later. Apple, on the other hand, had also introduced an Action Button on the iPhone 15 series, replacing the good old alert slider, which is presumably  considered an inspiration for the OnePlus in the first place.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's March update patch is out and it brings fixes to over 11 critical items.</li><li>The security patch will be rolled out to the Galaxy S23 and S24 series, along with the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and up.</li><li>Delivery time of these updates will vary based on the device model as well as the region, Samsung explains.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung announced that it's bringing a couple of bug fixes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">March security patch update</a>. While security patches don't bring in features, they help the available features on the device work better.</p><p>The March update has started to roll out to devices as we speak, fixing over 51 items that needed attention. Of these, 11 items were critical fixes, while the rest were high-priority items. Samsung says that this is a maintenance release for major flagship models as part of the monthly Security Maintenance Release (SMR) process. This means it includes not just Samsung's bug fixes but also some of Google's patches as well.</p><p>So far, the devices already receiving the March security patch (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/samsung-march-2025-security-update-these-devices/">via 9to5Google</a>) include the Galaxy S23 series and later, the Galaxy Z Fold 4/Z Flip 4 and later, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a55-march-2025-security-update/">Galaxy A55</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung mentions some of them on its updates page, like incorrect default permissions on the Galaxy Watch's gallery, which could allow local attackers to access data in the Galaxy Watch Gallery, improper access to Wifi on the Galaxy Watch—fixing an issue that allowed hackers to update MAC address of the watch.</p><p>Other than that, it fixes issues with sensitive communication in Settings and accessing Auracast broadcasting, among others. However, Samsung mentions that other items included in the update will not be disclosed publicly at this time.</p><p>The publication adds that Samsung first began rolling out this patch to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6 </a>and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"> Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> last week and is going to continue rolling them out to the above-mentioned devices as well.</p>
<p>The company notes that devices eligible for the upcoming security patch need to have their devices with an up-to-date OS. And that delivery times of the said security patch will vary based on the phone's model as well as the region the user is in.</p><p>That said, Galaxy devices are getting more than just security updates this month as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices"> company confirms</a> it is expanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">One UI 7</a> beta programs to Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-sensibly-sized-samsung-galaxy-s23-might-free-me-from-awkward-phones-and-camera-spec-overkill">Galaxy S23 </a>series, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review"> Galaxy Tab S10</a> series at various points this month.

That said, the Korean OEM is all geared up to launch the official, stable version of the software to all devices starting in April.</p>

<p>Ray-Ban and Meta have teamed up with Coperni for a stylish limited-edition version of their smart glasses, blending tech and high fashion.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ray-ban-meta-coperni-limited-edition-debut/" target="_blank">At Paris Fashion Week</a>, Ray-Ban and Coperni showed off a fresh take on the Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> x Coperni glasses stuck with the classic Wayfarer style but gave it a fresh look with a translucent black finish.</p><p>Part of Coperni’s Fall/Winter 2025 collection, these glasses mark Meta's first official fashion collaboration. While Meta has released a transparent limited-edition pair before for $429, this version stands out with unique tweaks and Coperni’s unmistakable design touch.</p><p>Inspired by last year’s translucent limited-edition models, the Coperni version rocks a similar transparent frame paired with grey mirrored lenses. The standout detail is a bold Coperni logo on the temple arm.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8432px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7HHtUrJcyWG4DLHTnmVUQB" name="Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni Limited Edition Glasses" alt="Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni Limited Edition Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HHtUrJcyWG4DLHTnmVUQB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8432" height="4743" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the hood, these glasses pack the same tech as Meta’s standard model, including 32GB of storage and a 12MP camera. It snaps photos at 3024 x 4032 pixels and shoots video at 1440 x 1920 pixels, running at 30 frames per second.</p><p>You’ll also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">have access to Meta AI</a>, which helps you learn about what’s in front of you, jot down notes, and translate languages. Plus, you can make calls and do even more. Meta AI can even scan QR codes right through the camera’s view.</p><p>Meta also added Shazam support, so you can now use your voice to search and play songs on Spotify and Amazon Music. The company also rolled out Meta AI’s upgraded memory features for even smarter assistance.</p>

<h2 id="an-ultra-limited-release-2">An ultra-limited release</h2>
<p>The Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni glasses may be hard to come by, with only 3,600 pairs up for grabs worldwide, and they’re priced higher than the standard model. If you’re thinking about snagging a pair, they’re already up for sale on Meta.com, Ray-Ban, and Coperni’s sites for $549.</p><p>The higher price tag makes sense given how limited these smart glasses are, so if you’re looking to grab a pair, you’ll want to act fast.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a watch with solar-recharging capabilities for optimal battery life; you want something that offers multi-band GPS without compromising battery; you want a watch with health tracking features like monitoring for heart rate, stress, sleep, or blood oxygen levels.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a particularly lightweight and small watch; you prefer a watch with peak display resolution; you're looking for a watch that leans more toward connectivity or app support than GPS or battery.</p><p>The Garmin Instinct Solar 2X is a great health, fitness, and GPS smartwatch, especially for its solar recharging abilities.  The 2X Solar is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch#section-best-battery">best battery life on a Garmin smartwatch</a>, and for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS option</a> for fitness tracking and GPS watches overall.</p><p>With solar, you can still get up to 36 hours of battery life when using multi-band GPS. However, backpackers, trail-runners, hikers and others out and about during the day can essentially get unlimited battery life when using solar charging and smartwatch mode, a major reason why this device is so well-liked. Plus, it comes with a built-in LED light, making it even more useful for outdoor enthusiasts and campers.</p><p>It's worth noting that those who want a lightweight smartwatch may not like the Instinct 2X Solar, as it's admittedly pretty bulky. It's also not a great pick if you prefer a more app-heavy smartwatch, or if you don't really need features like multi-band GPS or solar charging.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Chrome OS 134 is adding a feature to help extend your Chromebook’s battery life.</li><li>You’ll be able to cap charging at 80% to reduce battery wear, similar to Android 15’s feature for Pixel phones.</li><li>Charging stays at 100% by default, so if you don’t want to limit it, no action is needed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Chrome OS 134 is rolling out a handy new feature that’ll help you take better care of your Chromebook’s battery and make it last longer.</p><p>Over on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/1j4f54l/chromeos_134_is_finally_adding_a_battery_charge/" target="_blank">ChromeOS subreddit</a>, people have spotted a new feature mentioned in the latest Chrome Enterprise and Education <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7679408" target="_blank">release notes</a>. It’s set to drop in version 134, which is expected to roll out later this month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chromeos-134-battery-charge-limit-feature-3533345/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>According to the ChromeOS 133 release notes, a new optional battery charge limit feature is on the way in the next update. Similar to what Google recently rolled out for Pixel phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, this feature will let you set a max charge of 80% to help slow down battery wear and keep your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">Chromebook</a>’s battery healthier for longer.</p><p>Chrome OS 134 will let both users and admins set a battery charge limit. This feature should be especially useful for schools and businesses with large device fleets, helping extend battery life.</p><p>The default setting will stay at 100% charge, so if you’re not looking to limit your battery’s charging to extend its life, you don’t have to do a thing. The feature is there if you want it anyway.</p><p>Otherwise, if you decide to use the battery charge limit feature when ChromeOS 134 arrives, you’ll need to manually set a max charging cap. It’s similar to the default setup Google introduced in Android 15, so it’s a familiar option for those looking to keep their battery in top shape.</p><p>Overall, bringing this feature to ChromeOS after its debut in Android is a great move. For users looking to extend their Chromebook’s battery life, the new charge limit option will help slow down wear and keep devices running longer.</p><p>On top of battery improvements, future versions of ChromeOS will bring some upgrades to Chromebook Plus models, like AI-generated wallpapers and video call backgrounds. You’ll be able to pick from a bunch of templates and create high-res images in just a few clicks, making it super easy to personalize your device and make it truly yours.</p>

You get a bigger battery with fast charging, a brighter AMOLED panel this time, and a slightly altered design that's easier to hold and use. After a month and a half of use, I'm ready to call the Xiaomi 15 Ultra one of the best phones of 2025. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nRQs4RKPLsvkbRhrjzMY27" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRQs4RKPLsvkbRhrjzMY27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi made subtle changes to the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and the result is a device that's quite striking. While I'm using the white model, the two-tone variant of the device is styled to look like retro cameras, and it is definitely the one to get. The aesthetic combined with beveled sides and rounded edges make it great to hold and use, and even though it's heavy at 226g, I didn't notice that heft in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is built to last; Xiaomi is using a custom glass solution at the front, and the back is made out of a resilient material that weathers tumbles with ease. I didn't use a case with the phone, and after a month and a half of extensive use with travel to three countries, the 15 Ultra still looks pristine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-top-down-view-back-1" alt="Top-down view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXmEwKsjEoZjtXKpcmdBiZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung chose to go with a similar design, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> has rounded edges, and that makes it a little easier to hold. Outside of that, it is still a giant slab of a phone, and while the design is familiar, it doesn't quite stand out anywhere as much as Xiaomi's device. That said, the use of a titanium mid-frame gives the device greater rigidity. <br><br>Both devices get IP68 ingress protection, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. They both use ultrasonic biometric sensors, and the one on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is great to use — it's fast to authenticate and is ideally located.</p>

<p>Xiaomi once again went with a 6.73-inch AMOLED panel, but it has much better brightness this time around. While the phone doesn't get as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, it is noticeably brighter than the S25 Ultra both indoors and outdoors, and that's what ultimately matters. Xiaomi once again did a fantastic job tuning the panel out of the box, and you get vibrant colors and excellent contrast with plenty of adjustability.</p>

<p>To Samsung's credit, the brand did a good job slotting in a bigger 6.9-inch panel into the S25 Ultra, and it also has good color vibrancy. The anti-reflective coating on the panel makes it well-suited to outdoor use, and although it doesn't get as bright as its rivals, there are no issues viewing the panel under harsh sunlight. <br><br>Both phones do a great job with media playback and gaming, and they have good built-in audio. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra wins out thanks to a better in-hand feel and brighter panel, but the S25 Ultra gets a lot right — even though it doesn't quite have the same great feel.</p>

<p>There isn't anything missing on the hardware side of things, with both devices powered by the same Qualcomm silicon. Of course, Samsung once again gets a higher-binned version going up to 4.47GHz — while the standard platform in the Xiaomi goes up to 4.32GHz — but there's no noticeable difference between the two in daily use. Both phones are among the fastest available today, and they run demanding games effortlessly.</p>
<p>One point of contention with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is that it tends to overheat during extended gaming sessions; it gets hotter than most other 2025 phones I used, but the side effect is that it doesn't have any issues with throttling. The Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't have any issues in this regard, and it continues to be a standout choice.</p>

<p>The S25 Ultra base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but Xiaomi is selling the 16GB/512GB as the standard globally, and it uses the latest UFS 4.1 storage module instead of the UFS 4.0 that's on Samsung. Similarly, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra comes with a Bluetooth 6.0 radio, and it is the only device I used until now to have it. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or while making calls, and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has a fantastic vibration motor. <br><br>Xiaomi has a clear advantage with battery life; the 15 Ultra has a 5410mAh battery outside China, and it easily lasts over a day. The S25 Ultra also lasts a day, but the 5000mAh battery doesn't quite last as long as Xiaomi's device. Then there's the charging situation, with Samsung once again limiting its phone to 45W. Xiaomi retained 90W charging on the 15 Ultra, and it takes less than half as long to charge the battery as the S25 Ultra while lasting longer.</p>

<p>There's no contest — the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has the better camera package overall. The software I'm testing still has a few issues with HDR blooming, and as such, images aren't consistent all the time. Even then, the caliber of shots produced by the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is leagues better than the S25 Ultra — Samsung really needs to overhaul its strategy in this area. <br><br>The 15 Ultra has a 1-inch main camera with a Sony LYT-900 imaging module, and this year, it's joined by a 200MP Samsung HP9 tele lens that goes up to 4.3x, and a secondary 50MP tele that shoots at 3x. A 50MP wide-angle lens rounds out the cameras at the back, and this is the strongest set of cameras until the Vivo X200 Ultra or Find X8 Ultra debut sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Samsung is using the same 200MP main camera as last year, and while the S25 Ultra gets a new 50MP wide lens, it doesn't quite manage to stand out anywhere as much as its Chinese rival. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra wins out when it comes to dynamic range, color vibrancy, and detail rendition. Portraits in particular are stunning on the 15 Ultra, and you just don't get the same kind of segmentation or quality out of the S25 Ultra, and that's a real limitation.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and Samsung has the definite edge when it comes to software updates. The S25 Ultra will get seven Android updates, with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra limited to four. Samsung also does a much better job rolling out updates on time, and although the S24 Ultra is yet to make the switch to Android 15, there's a good bet that the device will get the stable build before the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — Xiaomi just doesn't roll out timely updates. <br><br>The software itself is unchanged on both phones, so if you've used a Xiaomi or Samsung device in the past, you'll be immediately familiar with what's on offer. Samsung's push into AI with Galaxy AI gives the S25 Ultra an extensive toolkit in this area, and whether it's image generation or editing, writing assistance, transcribing, or real-time translations, the device does a great job. I used the built-in audio transcribing utility on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra to good effect as well, but the phone doesn't have quite as many features as the S25 Ultra at least when it comes to the AI side of things. <br><br>Outside of that, there isn't much to talk about. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra has better fluidity than the S25 Ultra, and it doesn't have quite as many annoyances as earlier iterations of the software. Both skins need a visual overhaul, but they deliver extensive customizability.</p>

<p>Xiaomi didn't have to do too much to make the Xiaomi 15 Ultra stand out, and the addition of a new 200MP lens at the back alongside the usual design and hardware changes make the phone a real powerhouse. It has the best camera package of any 2025 device yet, and while there are some inconsistencies with HDR imagery, it takes fantastic photos and videos in just about any situation. <br><br>The design is better this time around, the battery lasts longer than last year, the AMOLED panel is brighter, and the UI is better. The phone runs hotter than its immediate rivals, but it doesn't have any shortcomings when it comes to gaming as such outside of the heat, and I didn't see any issues with connectivity. <br><br>Ultimately, the biggest issue with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is availability; Xiaomi still doesn't sell phones in the U.S., and that makes it annoying to get a hold of the device in region. But with the phone selling in India, the U.K., and key western markets, it is easier to buy than the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, and that's a big deal in and of itself. <br><br>Coming to Samsung, the Galaxy S25 Ultra just doesn't do enough to push the needle, and I'm not convinced that it's worth the cash. It is still a great phone in its own right, and if you're on an older Samsung device and want to make the switch, it is a viable choice. That said, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra does a better job in just about every area other than long-term update guarantee, and if you don't have any allegiance to Samsung, I highly recommend switching to Xiaomi — you'll love what this phone can do in daily use.</p>

<ul><li>Rolled out in January, the Android 13-based update was designed to stabilize the phone's battery.</li><li>It could reduce battery capacity and affect charging performance for some owners who were eligible for free battery replacements.</li><li>The ACCC, however, has issued a recall notice to warn users of the potential fire and burn risks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The six-year-old Pixel 4a phone got a surprise update early this year. While Google was quite hazy about the release of the update, indicating it is just a battery improvement update, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Product Safety Recall program depicts the actual reason (spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/10/pixel-4a-battery-recall/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=threads">9to5Google</a>)</p><p>It indicates that the rolled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/older-pixel-4a-to-get-an-all-new-battery-performance-update">January update</a> with the battery management feature was actually to “mitigate the risk of overheating.” The ACCC's shared notice dated March 7 indicates that some of the Pixel 4a devices sold from August 1, 2020, to September 30, 2022. It also mentions a hazard noting “an overheating battery could pose a risk of fire and/or burns to a user.”</p>
<p>For those unaware, the update to the Pixel 4a was precisely rolled out on January 8, and it was based on Android 13. The units globally have received the update, including Australia. It was to improve stability for Pixel 4a’s battery, and for some other Pixel 4a devices; however, it was believed to reduce the “available battery capacity” and impact “charging performance.”  Even so, those affected devices were eligible for appeasement which includes free battery replacement.</p><p>The ACCC here reiterates the same and further provides the following steps, which are more or less the same as those shared by Google during the January firmware update roll-out. Here's what to do in case you have the 4a:</p>
<ul><li>Check that your device has received this firmware update.</li><li>Consumers can submit a request to find out if their device is impacted <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495?sjid=18010863605852425767-EU&visit_id=638760748417158479-7770477&p=pixel4a_battery_help&rd=1">here</a>.</li><li>This issue does not affect all Pixel 4a devices; if a consumer’s device is not impacted by the issue, the firmware update will have no impact on battery management, and the device will perform the same as before.</li><li>Consumers may be eligible for an appeasement from Google. You can check your appeasement eligibility <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495?sjid=18010863605852425767-EU&visit_id=638760748417158479-7770477&p=pixel4a_battery_help&rd=1">here</a>.</li></ul>
<p>While we now know the true reason for the surprise update roll-out for the Pixel 4a, it is commendable of Google to support such older Pixel phones. Surprise updates aren’t new for the Pixel 4a as the search giant rolled out a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-4a-gets-a-surprise-update">unexpected update</a> in November 2023, which was also Android 13-based.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last Monday, Nothing introduced its brand-new phones,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch"> the Phone 3a and the Phone 3a Pro models.</a> They will be available for pre-orders starting this Tuesday (March 11) in certain regions. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro already has a new update bringing camera improvements and more.</p><p>It appears Nothing is making sure the Phone 3a Pro’s first experience for users should be hassle-free and is already bringing an update before the device’s availability to the masses. Tipster Ishan Agarwal on X has shared the latest changelog of the Phone 3a Pro update, which seems to have rolled out over the weekend.</p>

<p>The camera enhancements, per the changelog, include new camera presets for quick access, which can be shared and imported. The ability to share these presets also means exchanging your favorite camera settings and filters with others or within the Nothing community.</p><p>Additionally, users can also expect support for importing cube files to use their custom filters. For the unaware, (dot)cube is a specific file format for volumetric data that includes a color grading preset.</p><p>Other than these additions, in terms of camera, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> owners can also experience better overall camera performance, clarity improvements in macro mode, and refinements for portrait for accurate bokeh.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> is another interesting feature introduced with the Phone 3a series, which is accompanied by a new Essential Key on the phone placed on the right pane. It is AI-powered and, as the name suggests, does essential stuff on your phone, and the new firmware is also bringing improvements to it.</p><p>After the update, users can quickly press to save what’s on their screen and “add notes, long press to instantly record voice notes while saving.” Then there are new Essential Space widgets included with the update that let users view their content directly on their home and lock screens.</p>
<p>For a better user experience, Nothing is also revamping the home page and detail page. Moreover, there is also a new “Upcoming” section to manage essential tasks in a single place. Lastly, there are smart insights, which can now be displayed in users’ preferred system language.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some other improvements incorporated in the latest firmware, which according to the changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Added AI-powered face and scene classification to Nothing Gallery.</li><li>Fine-tuned interaction and user experience in Nothing Gallery.</li><li>Introduced a power-off password verification feature. Find it in settings by searching for ‘Power off verify.’</li><li>Addressed various bugs for a more stable experience.</li></ul>

<p>It is encouraging to see Nothing already rolling out updates right before the preorders, which began on March 11. The Phone 3a Pro starts at Rs 29,999 for the 128GB variant, and the 256GB model costs Rs 31,999 for the Indian market. In the U.S., however, the company is selling the Phone 3a series through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://in.nothing.tech/pages/phone-2a-plus?awc=48011_1741606918_dc34f9d89c1f3a897be81cf6795791fa&sv1=affiliate&sv_campaign_id=103504&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=Awin">Nothing Beta Program</a>.</p>

<ul><li>An “Untrusted device” error prevents content streaming from mobile devices to second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio models.</li><li>Affected users were unable to cast content from apps like YouTube, with no option to proceed beyond the error message.</li><li>It is likely a bug affecting second-gen Chromecast models, potentially requiring a server-side fix from Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Chromecast owners who wanted to watch something over a weekend might have faced issues with streaming content from their devices. Several complained about having an “Untrusted device” error for older-generation models.</p><p>In particular, the second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio owners have been the ones who have faced the error when they tried to cast content from their handsets (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/09/chromecast-2nd-gen-audio/">9to5Google</a>). With the above error upping up more frequently, it gave users the impression that their devices couldn’t be verified and that outdated firmware could be the issue.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7caui/did_google_just_brick_the_2nd_gen_chromecast">Did Google just brick the 2nd gen Chromecast?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast">r/Chromecast</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The issue has been reported by several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/">users on Reddit</a> and had occurred while casting something from their mobile handset through streaming apps like YouTube, for instance. The “Untrusted device” error only gave users an option to close the window, without giving any option to go forward. However, other features like screensavers using Google Photos, art, and photography seem to have been working normally as before.</p><p>Interestingly, it appears to be a bug, and, going by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7c352/chromecast_is_untrusted/">user complaints</a> on Reddit, the affected users include only second-gen Chromecast and Chromecast audio users, while the first and third-gen users didn’t have any issues on Sunday (March 9).</p>
<p>Reddit users have also started assuming that Google might have bricked their older Chromecast with the new error message, pushing them to buy newer models. Some have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1j7kqii/chromecast_alternatives/">started looking</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">alternatives to stream freely</a>. However, it seems like the search giant might be issuing a server-side fix soon for the said models.</p><p>The publication further notes that Google hasn’t mentioned ending support for reported 2015-released Chromecast devices and, while some think the new error could be an indication of dropping support as it did with the first-gen model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/first-gen-chromecast-discontinued">back in 2023</a>.</p><p>As mentioned, the outage of the said second-gen Chromecast models is likely a bug, which was uncalled for. And we hope that Google might be releasing a fix as early as possible.</p>

It might seem hard to compare the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Phone 2a Plus, since their names sound quite different. In reality, they're both the higher-tier offerings available in the Phone 3a series and the Phone 2a series, respectively.</p><p>That means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a> are perfect for comparison, and you might be choosing between them. The naming tweak tells a bit of the story between these two mid-rangers. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro brings a more well-rounded set of upgrades this year, hence why it has the "Pro" branding. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus was a more minor spec bump, which explains the lesser "Plus" branding.</p><p>But which one should you buy? Let's find out and break down how these two Nothing smartphones compare.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-phone-2a-plus-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Phone 2a Plus: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="53rjwbksdqALeehHLDVugD" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-camera-island-01" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53rjwbksdqALeehHLDVugD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these two phones are similarly sized and feature the Glyph Interface, that's about where the similarities end. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro measures 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.39mm, while the Phone 2a Plus is slightly smaller at 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.6mm. On the other hand, you'll certainly feel the weight difference between the two devices. The Phone 3a Pro is 21 grams heavier than the Phone 2a Plus, with the latter weighing 190 grams.</p><p>The Phone 3a Pro has a striking appearance, with three rear cameras and a flash positioned asymmetrically. The camera bump is also a huge, massive circular extrusion from the back of the device. For perspective, the camera bump itself on the Phone 3a Pro is about the thickness of the thinnest iPod Nano. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus has a more subdued look with a flat back and a smaller, dual-camera housing.</p><p>Both phones make a statement with their transparent, raw appearance. They also have LEDs on the back that form the Glyph Interface, and the lights are all rounded to match the curvature of the camera housing on the Phone 3a Pro. Meanwhile, on the Phone 2a Plus, two lights are curved and one is a straight line. These LEDs can be used for notifications, timers, and more.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a slightly larger display measuring 6.77 inches — it's just a tad bit bigger than the 6.7-inch panel on the Phone 2a Plus. While both phones use OLED displays, the Phone 3a Pro has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-ltpo-mean-and-why-is-it-important-on-your-device">LTPO panel for smoother refresh rates</a>. Both screens top out at 120Hz, but the Phone 3a Pro's high brightness rating is the same as the Phone 2a Plus' peak brightness rating. It'll be better suited for use outdoors and in tough lighting situations.</p><p>In terms of durability, Nothing decided to go with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Panda Glass on the Phone 3a Pro</a>. It's hardened glass, but may not resist scratches as well as Gorilla Glass. If you prefer the tried-and-tested option, the Phone 2a Plus has Gorilla Glass 5 on the front. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has an IP64 rating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">against dust and water ingress</a>, whereas the Phone 2a Plus is less protected with an IP54 certification.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The performance of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and Phone 2a Plus may be more similar than you might think, depending on what you value. The newer model features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> processor, ditching the MediaTek chip in its predecessor. While this chip has been optimized for AI tasks and was recently updated, it's still a mid-tier chip. Our testing found that in graphical performance, the Phone 3a series could actually succumb to the Phone 2a series in benchmarks and real-world tests.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.77%;"><img id="9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-minecraft-gaming-performance" alt="Comparing game performance in Minecraft between the Nothing Phone 3a/3a Pro and the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That means if you care about gaming, you may want to pick up the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor in the Phone 2a Plus. It's paired with 12GB of RAM for increased performance, and that could be very desirable in some situations. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro is offered in multiple configurations with 8GB and 12GB RAM variants.</p><p>It's worth noting that despite the Phone 2a series' apparent advantages in graphics, neither of Android Central's testers noticed poor performance from the Phone 3a Pro in daily use.</p>

<p>Both phones feature a 5,000mAh battery and 50W wired charging, so they should last long and charge fast. In terms of connectivity, the Phone 3a Pro has the advantage with Bluetooth 5.4. Both handsets offer Wi-Fi 6 and 5G, but support for U.S. carriers is extremely limited. Neither support CDMA, meaning Verizon basically won't work at all on either device. As such, this device is much better suited for use in regions like Europe and India.</p><p>Software support is better on the Phone 3a Pro, with a promise of three OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. Meanwhile, the Phone 2a Plus only gets three OS upgrades and four total years of security patches. Both phones can run Nothing OS 3, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, today. However, only the Phone 3a Pro will have Nothing's latest and greatest AI features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">including the Essential Space</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing really went all-out for the camera system on the Phone 3a Pro. It's the best available on a phone of this price point, by a mile. The main sensor is a 50MP, f/1.88 Samsung lens with a 1/1.56-inch sensor size, and that large camera will help you take great photos. The real impressive feat is the inclusion of a 50MP, f/2.55 Sony periscope telephoto lens. It offers 3x true optical zoom, but a massive 1/1.95-inch sensor size allows for sensor crop to provide 6x optical-quality zoom with sensor crop.</p><p>It makes for photos captured at distance having great detail, as you can see in the gallery below. These photos were taken at various zoom levels with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro:</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 2a Plus' camera system is no slouch, either. It has a 50MP, f/1.9 Samsung GN9 main sensor paired with a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens. Both of these cameras are excellent for the price, but neither can deliver the level of optical quality zoom that the Phone 3a Pro can. That's because the Phone 2a Plus only offers a dual-camera system, and it lacks a telephoto lens.</p><p>On the front, both phones are completely equal. They're both using a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung lens with a 1/2.76-inch sensor size.</p>

<p>The choice between the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and the Phone 2a Plus is pretty cut-and-dry, as long as specs and value proposition are your main priorities. The Phone 3a Pro has the better processor overall, the better camera system, and full-fledged Nothing OS 3. It's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. However, it does have that chunky camera bump, so I can understand wanting to grab the Phone 2a Plus for a more subdued look.</p><p>The good news is that if you have the Phone 2a Plus, there's no need to upgrade. You already have the exact same battery capacity, charging speeds, and front-facing camera as the newer model. Additionally, the Phone 2a Plus is set to get two more Android OS upgrades, meaning it has plenty of life left in it.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel users are dealing with a screen brightness glitch after the March update, mostly when watching videos in fullscreen.</li><li>Some Pixel 9 Pro users also noticed wallpapers dimming while icons stay bright, hinting at a broader display bug.</li><li>A temporary fix is turning off Smooth Display, but that means losing the 120Hz refresh rate, making scrolling less smooth.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A growing number of Pixel users are speaking up about a screen brightness glitch hitting their phones after the March update, and it seems to kick in mostly when they’re watching videos in fullscreen.</p><p>Google’s March Pixel Feature Drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">rolled out some handy upgrades and fixed a few key bugs</a>, but as usual with software updates, there’s always a chance for new quirks to pop up after the fact.</p><p>Reddit users are now flagging a screen brightness glitch presumably tied to the March Feature Drop, mostly messing with video playback (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phone-brightness-bug-3533289/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). One Pixel 8 Pro owner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j596zm/netflix_brightness_bug_after_a15_qpr2_update/" target="_blank">shared their experience</a>, mentioning constant, annoying shifts in brightness while streaming Netflix, with the screen cycling between too bright and too dim.</p><p>The user specifically blamed the March Feature Drop for the display glitch, noting it wasn’t an issue before the update. Many others backed this up, pointing to the update as the cause. And even with adaptive brightness turned off, the problem stuck around, so that feature’s definitely not the culprit.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> user also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5khf5/brightness_issue/?rdt=46254" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the brightness issue, noticing the same flickering on Prime Video, not just Netflix. Other Pixel users have reported similar problems on Disney+ and YouTube, making it clear this isn’t just an app-specific bug.</p><p>Another user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j543po/wallpaper_very_dark_after_march_update/" target="_blank">noticed</a> that on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, wallpapers look dim even at max brightness, while icons stay as bright as expected. Several Pixel 8 users chimed in with the same issue, suggesting this might be a wider problem across multiple models.</p><p>It looks like the brightness glitch is popping up across a bunch of Pixel models, from the Pixel 6 series all the way to the Pixel 9. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5llvm/netflix_brightness_flickering_issue_after_march/" target="_blank">Pixel 7 Pro user</a> even figured out a specific trigger on Netflix where the flickering only happens when subtitles are turned on.</p><p>One Pixel 9 user found a quick fix, though it comes with a trade-off. Turning off the Smooth Display setting stops the flickering, but it also locks the screen to a 60Hz refresh rate instead of the smoother 120Hz. That means scrolling and animations won’t feel as fluid, but at least the brightness issue is gone.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

<ul><li>The DOJ is still pushing Google to sell Chrome, and maybe even Android, to break its search monopoly.</li><li>Selling Chrome would give other search engines a real shot at a broader reach of users, as per the filing.</li><li>The DOJ dropped its demand for Google to sell AI investments but wants stricter oversight.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The US Department of Justice is once again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">pressuring Google to divest Chrome</a>, with the goal of challenging its dominant position in search and promoting fair competition.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/pr/2025/2025-3-google.pdf" target="_blank">revised filing</a> to Judge Amit Mehta, the DOJ is doubling down on its push for Google to sell off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, and maybe even Android. The agency argues that breaking up these key assets is the only way to fix Google’s monopoly problem.</p><p>A group of 38 state attorneys general and the DOJ have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2025/3/7/pr25-13.html" target="_blank">teamed up</a> to file the updated proposal laying out the final steps to break Google’s illegal stranglehold on the search engine market. It stays close to the original one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">submitted to Judge Amit Mehta last November</a>, following his historic ruling that Google is a monopoly in online search.</p><p>In its latest filing, the DOJ argues that forcing Google to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> would break its grip on a key search gateway, opening the door for real competition. It also kept an earlier proposal to stop Google from cutting deals with companies like Apple, phone manufacturers, and Mozilla to lock in its search engine as the default.</p><p>A key change in the DOJ’s updated proposal is ditching the demand for Google to sell off its AI investments. Instead of an outright ban, the agency is moving toward a more watchful approach, requiring Google to give regulators a heads-up before making any moves in the AI space.</p><p>The DOJ is also holding off on forcing Google to sell Android for now. Instead, the court will keep the option on the table, ready to step in if the current fixes don’t level the playing field. If competition doesn’t improve, Google might have to let go of the operating system down the line.</p><p>Google is expected to counter the proposals with its own. In its December filing, the company slammed the DOJ’s initial demands as over the top, calling them an "interventionist agenda" that went way beyond the court’s ruling. Google argued the case was about its deals with partners, not the massive overhaul the DOJ is pushing for.</p>

Some were gimmicky, while others clearly put some thought into making things practical.</p><p>The Liberty 4 Pro is the latter, and not only do they sound good, but they also give you some valuable controls for your earbuds when you’re in Zoom meetings or just listening from the desktop and want to control your sound.</p><p>Here are my full thoughts on the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro.</p>

<p>The Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro are available from soundcore.com and Amazon for $130. You can pick up a pair in Glossy Black, White, and Glossy Light Blue.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review" target="_blank">Liberty 4 NC </a>went on sale pretty regularly, and the Liberty 4 Pro did see a $30 price drop during the holiday season, so it’s reasonable to think you’d be able to get a better deal if you’re patient.</p>

<p>Let’s get right to it! The sound produced by the Liberty 4 Pros is powerful! You get a soundstage with headroom to spare, boomy bass, punchy mids, and output that has you rarely needing to raise the source volume higher than around 65% of max.</p><p>Though not the highest durability rating, the Liberty 4 Pro should be able to handle whatever workouts you throw at them with an IP55 rating for water and dust ingress. They ship with Bluetooth 5.3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a> support for hi-res wireless audio, along with Spatial Audio support. You get Easy Chat, which is an audio ducking feature that “hears” conversation and lowers the audio volume so you can carry on a conversation.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of customization options on board here, including five additional earbud tips in the box, not including the medium ear tips that are installed by default. The remaining wealth of options can be found in the app. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>The big marketing push with this latest iteration of the Liberty from Anker’s Soundcore brand is the case. It has some cool features that are expanded when you use the app. The default is that when you take the earbuds out of their case, you’ll automatically see the battery status, and then the screen transitions to controlling ANC.</p><p>This isn’t a touch screen likely because it’s so tiny that your finger would cover the majority of the screen real estate. Instead, you get a touch bar below the screen to control the ANC slider.</p><p>Going into the app and the <em>Charging Case Settings</em> menu, you can turn on spatial audio controls, atmospheric ANC status display, a Find Device feature that allows you to ring the case and earbuds independently if you can’t find them, and a remote camera shutter function if your phone supports it. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> did support it and worked flawlessly as long as the camera was launched first on the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-case-closed-alt.JPG" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My only gripe is that with the transparent lid shut, you can only control the default setting, ANC. When activated from the app, all other options can only be accessed with the lid in the open position.</p><p>I wonder how many people will use the case, though, because you can access ANC and spatial audio options from Android and iOS widgets. The Find Device functionality is likely the only case function that is worth pulling the case out for most people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-touch-pad" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro touch bar, with the case closed </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think that the case functions will be most useful as a desktop remote extension of the app like a smartwatch is, to a great degree, a useful extension of your phone. Unlike your phone, you don’t need to unlock the case to access the default features or those you add to it via the app. So, the case sitting on your desktop while you’re doing work is the ideal use case for the touch bar and smart display.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Liberty 4 NC</a> did, the Liberty Pro gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price. Battery life is just under six hours in my testing at 65% of max volume on my Google Pixel 9. The great thing is that you can get four hours of playback time with just five minutes inside the charging case.</p><p>The battery isn’t the only aspect that has juice! The power output is wonderful. On a Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, I rarely had to have the volume higher than 65%. A pet peeve of mine is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> that require me to crank the volume to the maximum to get robust audio.</p><p>For a $130 pair of earbuds and in true Soundcore style, the Liberty 4 Pros punch above their weight. They’re definitely tuned for popular music, but their clarity and sub-bass extension are delightful.</p><p>Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” you get a very clear sonic picture of the beautifully layered instrumentation. The horns are crisp, the upright bass is thumping with a deep resonance, and the sparse vocals that are layered somewhat in the background are easily audible.</p><p>However, there’s more moanin’ to be had. Art Blakey’s version of “Moanin’” is where you get a sense of just how bright the Liberty 4 Pro can be as the horns on that composition become fatiguing after a bit. As entertaining as the sound profile is, it doesn’t sacrifice anything at the higher frequencies.</p><p>Listening to other tracks like the “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” soundtrack and “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” soundtrack show off the enormous soundstage of these mid-level Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>The Liberty 4 Pro is indeed a solid performer, but nothing is perfect. As intriguing as the Smart Display and its functionality are, I’m not a huge fan of the fact that you’ll have to open the case for anything other than the ANC slider option. You can see through the case, so why have to open it for other functions?</p><p>Regarding sound quality, the 4 Pros can be a bit bright, so depending on the genre, your listening session may become a tad fatiguing. Thankfully, if that’s the case, there are EQ options to help tamp down that top end a bit.</p><p>And you'll definitely want to play with the different sound profiles a bit. Out of the box, the Liberty 4 Pro is definitely tuned for popular music, so the sonics are heavier on the low end and a tad lighter when it comes to nuance.</p><p>The previous generation Liberty 4 NC has better noise canceling, so if you’re asking if you should upgrade to these, I’d say “no.” ANC isn’t significantly better with the 4 NC, but it is enough of a difference, without a significant difference in sound quality, that an upgrade is far from necessary.</p><p>Last, depending on the fit of your ears, the earbud volume controls could be a bit of an annoyance. You use a sliding motion on the stems to increase or decrease volume. It works quite well, as do all of the other controls, but sliding at the stem could dislodge the earbuds a bit.</p>

<p>We saw some fantastic competitors emerge in 2024 in the mid-range noise-canceling earbuds market, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">you have some solid alternatives</a> here. First, I’d take a look at both Nothing earbuds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear (a)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear 2024</a>. The latter fully competes on features with the Liberty 4 Pro, though its case isn’t as “smart.” They do have better EQ settings with the ability to adjust frequency bandwidth, but it will cost you roughly $20 more.</p><p>You also have ‘buds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, the JBL Live Pro 2 TWS, and a shrewd buy if you pick up one of Jabra’s “end of life” Elite 10 (gen 1) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Elite 8 Active</a> earbuds. All are solid competitors to the Liberty 4 Pro, though if you prefer the stem style, you’ll want to skip Jabra’s products.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-soundcore-liberty-4-pro-should-you-buy-them"><span>Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro: Should you buy them?</span></h2>
<p><strong>You should buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Super fast charging</li><li>You want Hi-Res Wireless Audio support</li><li>You want a case that supports some earbud controls</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Top-tier noise canceling is mission-critical</li><li>You aren’t a fan of stem-based touch controls</li></ul>
<p>The Liberty 4 Pro gives you a case that is larger than the previous generation Liberty 4 NC, but you’ll have to decide if its features are worth the increase in size. In every other metric, the experience you get is quite good for earbuds in the mid-range market, especially considering that you’ll save around $30 compared to some competitors.</p><p>For solid music reproduction, great call quality, and the ability to use the case as a desktop extension for controls, you should definitely take a look at Soundcore’s Liberty 4 Pro if you’re in the market for mid-range Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Strava may be the most popular fitness app in the world, with 135 million users and counting, 51 million logged activities per week, and 1 million communal clubs. But its new Athlete Intelligence shows Strava isn't resting on its laurels, and it wants you to know that its AI isn't "just an LLM," even if you might assume that.</p><p>On Wednesday, I watched cheerful Strava employees celebrate the opening of their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/stravas-new-global-headquarters-signals-growth-and-innovation">new San Francisco HQ</a> after a brief speech from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. He called Strava the "tip of the spear" to convince people that "San Francisco is open for business" and "the greatest city in the world."</p><p>Strava's multi-floor office focuses more on celebrating the <em>world</em> of fitness if anything. I toured the office with CEO Mike Martin and Chief of Staff Shelby Rhodes, who showed me meeting rooms named after internationally beloved segments like Central Park or Alpe d’Huez. I also saw a live Strava Photo Map that highlights photos that their AI labels as "beautiful" from around the world, as well as employees' bibs from their favorite races.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi" name="Strava-sf-map" alt="A gif showing a full map of San Francisco, with lines representing each Strava user's live public route that day starting around 5am" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But my favorite exhibit focused on SF: a live, chronological map of the city that showed the live flyover progress of local Strava users' activity that day. It's an incredible effect, and I told the Strava execs that they should seriously consider upgrading its weekly heat maps to let users see the previous day's activity, at least in the big cities. They don't have any plans for it, but hopefully, I planted the seed for it to happen.</p><p>Add in the library of running books and wall art showing people's GPS-made art, and it was nerd heaven for a runner like me. But as much as I enjoyed the tour, my main objective was to sit down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-ushers-in-its-next-era-with-appointments-of-new-chief-product-officer" target="_blank">CPO Matt Salazar and CTO Rob Terrell</a> to dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Athlete Intelligence</a> — and figure out where Strava is going next.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they couldn't say too much that's new about their "future roadmap," but I still got a sense of where Strava Athlete Intelligence could go next.</p>
<h2 id="athlete-intelligence-has-room-to-grow-2">Athlete Intelligence has room to grow</h2>
<p>Athlete Intelligence just left beta, and Strava claims "80+% of users say that Athlete Intelligence is very helpful" based on in-app feedback. I myself have noticed a definite improvement in the accuracy of the data, but I asked Salazar and Terrell what their vision of Athlete Intelligence is and how it benefits users.</p><p>Terrell explained that "it was important to me that Strava do something that was much more significant" than the "low-effort" LLMs out there that spit out vague answers and can only give generalized advice from Google.</p><p>Even if "from the outside, it looks like it's just an LLM," their goal was to "really synthesize the granular data that we have about the users' activity and do deeper analysis with machine learning to understand the context of that data."</p><p>Salazar, in turn, noted that "not all people are at the same experience level to interpret heart rate zones or their pace." Their AI makes this data "much simpler and easier to understand" for beginners who might not understand the impact of anaerobic activity or who don't want to check back at old activities to see how their pace has changed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strava's AI primarily focuses on runs, hikes, walks, and cycling. I asked about their plans to expand to other activities, and Salazar explained that even as they "make sure it covers everything," eventually, they want to ensure first that "when we put out something, it's a sufficient quality," and that other sports might need more internal testing before it's "fully baked."</p><p>I then noted that Athlete Intelligence is very responsive rather than proactive: It tells you how you did after the fact but doesn't necessarily recommend a training plan or target pace for <em>future</em> runs as you get on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. Will that change?</p><p>Salazar said that they're not specifically looking for "the next AI thing we can do," but rather "how do we help users achieve their goals?" Up until now, that's been through incentives like challenge badges, monthly goal targets, and kudos from friends. But AI is one "particular tool that we're looking at" that could come into play next.</p><p>Terrell agreed that Strava "historically has been a backward-looking product" that largely leaves planning in users' hands and that while they're "not announcing any products" on this front at this time, they are "interested in...being forward-looking."</p><p>Even without any specifics, a more proactive form of Athlete Intelligence would make it more useful for beginners <em>and</em> serious athletes, so consider me hopeful that this evolution comes next.</p>

<p>The most passionate response I got from Terrell, Salazar, and even the CEO was when I jokingly mentioned the time I didn't get credit for a half-marathon PR because my watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/sf-half-marathon-distance-controversy-shows-need-for-accurate-gps-watch">didn't measure the full 13.1 miles</a>. Apparently, a lot of users want Strava to "fix" this and aren't at all amused about it.</p><p>I frequently test the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">GPS accuracy of smartwatches</a> and know how fallible they can be. But plenty of Strava users don't realize that — as Terrell put it — the app is "limited by the accuracy of devices that users are using" and that they want to be "as accurate as possible" rather than "fudge" the data.</p><p>Strava itself said in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-dethroned-garmin-on-strava-in-2024-heres-why">Year in Review 2024</a> that 72% of Strava activities come from users' phones, which aren't necessarily as optimized as smartwatches when it comes to GPS accuracy.</p><p>Users can trim activities if they forget to pause before driving home, but letting users <em>add</em> distance to a run is a slippery slope. Yes, sometimes GPS inaccuracies give you the wrong data, but sometimes, it's the course itself that's short. Strava's team wants to be "truth tellers...when folks are trying to compare themselves against each other, especially at a pro level," Salazar explained.</p><p>"When we first joined, Matt and I were like, 'Let's just fix it. This is easy!' And then we dug into it, and it's like, oh yeah, there's nothing—," Terrell said, with Salazar jumping in with, "there's a lot of steps, yeah."</p><p>"We understand the user pain here, and we're looking for ways to solve it, but there's not an easy answer," Terrell concluded.</p>

<p>I also asked if Strava would ever consider using its segment leaderboards to create official race leaderboards on Strava. They themselves said that more than half of runners at major marathons like NYC, Boston, and London logged their races on Strava last year, so what if runners could see how they ranked among Strava users and compare their race times against previous years?</p><p>Salazar answered very carefully that they "can't speak towards future roadmap, but...all I can say is that that use case is very important for us, and it's very much present in our minds. So I'm thinking about how we can help users celebrate that moment; we know it's a moment they want to celebrate."</p><p>While this isn't exactly a confirmation, it does make me optimistic that Strava might be working on race leaderboards that make it easier to connect with fellow racers you met. Labeling races and grouping times might make it easier for Athlete Intelligence to rate your effort compared to others in your age group and gender, which would be enlightening!</p>

<p>Just in 2024, Strava added Athlete Intelligence, weekly and night heatmaps, a dark mode, and closer integrations with Oura and Apple Fitness Plus. So far this year, they've improved leaderboard integrity, made it easier to share your workout flyovers to brag on social media, and just this week added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-introduces-proprietary-map-rendering-engine">3D FATMAP terrain data</a> designed for winter sports athletes to see gradients, aspects, and even the nearby danger areas for avalanches.</p><p>Strava didn't have any other future info to share yet, aside from telling me about FATMAP the day before its reveal. But I did get Strava's execs to hint at "future stuff that we shouldn't talk about," in their words.</p><p>When I asked if Athlete Intelligence — which currently seems to focus on your last 30 days of activities for relative effort — would ever look at older data or take into account goals like "training for a marathon," Terrell circled back to his initial point:</p><p>"We're not just stuffing a prompt into an LLM; we are building custom models that will allow us to do different levels of interesting analysis. And what we can feed into the LLM will be much more specific to the users, sort of their lifelong fitness journey. So the LLM is going to be able to speak to a much broader array of aspects of your active life."</p><p>Salazar jumped in to agree that they're always asking "how can we develop more sophistication in what insights we can give the users," and that Athlete Intelligence "is not <em>done</em> by any means." They'll continue to grow and smarten up the feature, making it more useful for a wider range of athletes.</p><p>It'll be fascinating to see how Strava's AI efforts compare against a hypothetical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini Coach in Fitbit</a> or the Samsung Health Coach coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6#section-one-ui-7-watch">Wear OS 6</a>. At the moment, Strava has a head start on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and doesn't intend to slow down.</p>

However, that cushion might be starting to wear thin, leaving us to wonder whether the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is still the best that money can buy.</p><p>Samsung made a couple of surprising decisions with its flagship tablet lineup, of which only one really affects the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>. Dropping Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek was a bold choice, but besides that, it might look like there's not really much of a difference when compared to its predecessor. So let's dive in and see whether that's the case or if there's some kind of hidden magic.</p>

<p>No matter what your feelings are when it comes to using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, sometimes it's best when a company recognizes that it doesn't need to make any drastic design changes. That's exactly what Samsung has done with the Tab S10 Ultra, as it seems like we just have updated internals packed inside of the same shell from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>.</p><p>That means if you're upgrading from the previous version, you won't have to shell out a bunch of extra cash for new cases or accessories. This was something that drove me absolutely mad when Samsung went from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/day-in-the-life-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra">Tab S8 Ultra</a> to the Tab S9 Ultra. Thankfully, it's not an issue this time around.</p><p>Externally, literally, everything remains the same, with the exception of the colors on the Tab S10 Ultra. The 14.6-inch AMOLED display is as beautiful as ever, making it perfect for getting work done, playing games, or propping it up to watch a movie.</p><p>Oh yeah, and the S Pen is still included in the box, which was to be expected but is still welcome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-16" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected wirelessly to Samsung monitor via Samsung DeX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that the possibilities of what you can do with the Tab S10 Ultra are practically endless. I've used it as an external monitor for both my desktop and gaming handheld, a smart home dashboard, a digital notebook, and more. In fact, I'm writing this on the Tab S10 Ultra using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, which is connected wirelessly to my 49-inch Samsung OLED ultrawide monitor.</p><p>It's a bit odd, sure, especially because the giant 14.6-inch display is currently doubling as a massive touchpad. That's because this kind of just happened on a whim, and the Ultra is connected to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cases">Book Cover Keyboard Slim</a> (the one without a built-in trackpad.) Of course, connecting a mouse would make more sense, but I kind of like how I can just reach up and have the world's biggest touchpad.</p>

<p>To quickly recap, the Tab S10 Ultra is basically the Tab S9 Ultra that gets one extra year of updates. Well, not <em>exactly</em>. In a move that still surprises me, Samsung went with the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or even the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>But to be quite honest, except for one very specific niche, you wouldn't know it. And that's a good thing because if that weren't the case, Samsung would have much bigger problems on its hands.</p><p>So why would Samsung move away from Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek? That's right, you guessed it — AI. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are being touted as the company's "first tablets purpose-built for AI." But before getting too ahead of ourselves here, let's see how the Dimensity 9300 Plus compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Tab S9 Ultra:</p>

<p>While single-core scores match up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> destroys its competitor in multi-core Geekbench AI. Which just so happened to be the two key areas of focus when Samsung introduced the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>However, I would go so far as to say that you wouldn't notice a difference if you were asked to use either of these in some sort of "blind test." On the one hand, that's great, as it would be a very different story if Samsung's flagship tablet ended up performing worse. On the other, you might've hoped to see more of a jump in the single-core performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-11" alt="microSD card hanging out of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Especially if you happen to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do in the Galaxy S25 with its 3,025 single-core score and 9,640 multi-core score. Mind you, that's for a phone that costs $400 less than the base model Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Furthermore, the 8 Elite launched after the Tab S10, so it makes sense we didn't see it here.</p><p>Nevertheless, there's almost nothing to really complain about when it comes to performance. You'll still enjoy Samsung's suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, paired quite nicely with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. So, I can only hope that Samsung has left enough overhead for any other potential AI features that we'll see in the years to come.</p><p>Oh, and remember how I said that Samsung essentially kept the design the same as the Tab S9 Ultra? That also goes for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slot</a>, which is a welcome inclusion on any device, let alone one that can serve as a gaming and media playback behemoth.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Giant monitors and trackpads aside, my Tab S10 Ultra usually resides in DeX mode. I don't really have much reason to ever go back to "regular" Android because it's all icky and annoying there. Well, at least for tablets of this size.</p><p>With Google finally working on a proper desktop mode for Pixel devices, it only further drives the point home that certain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablets</a> should default to DeX mode out of the box. And if doesn't want to do it for every tablet, the Tab S Ultra should be the first.</p><p>The traditional Android experience still doesn't work well on tablets or even foldable phones. App scaling is weird; apps don't play nice when going beyond the confines of a narrow rectangle, and sometimes even the interface just looks odd. DeX solves most of those problems with a little help from One UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-14" alt="iPad Pro M4 next to Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with keyboard cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes total sense for Samsung to just embrace the idea of the Tab S Ultra providing a Microsoft Surface experience, powered by One UI and Android. However, this leads me to another issue that I was hoping it would solve but has yet to do so.</p><p>Samsung needs to "borrow" Apple's iPad Pro Magic Keyboard design.</p><p>I applaud the company for making it so you can use the Tab S9 Ultra cases with the newer model. Technically, there are two "new" keyboard cases that launched alongside the Tab S10 Ultra. But the only real difference is the addition of the Galaxy AI key next to the arrow keys.</p><p>Unfortunately, you have a tablet that can double as a laptop, but it's arguably one of the most uncomfortable "laptops" that you'll ever use. With the Book Cover Keyboard, everything works fine, but try using it with your Tab S10 Ultra on your lap, and you'll immediately want to pull out your hair.</p><p>The Book Cover Keyboard Slim is slightly better, as it's a bit more rigid than its counterpart. However, you miss out on the trackpad, which is fine in some instances but isn't the ideal experience for everyone.</p>

<p>Whenever I get a new Android device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or gaming handheld, the first thing I try to do is see how well it can handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulation</a>. Most modern devices can handle up to PS2 games fairly easily. The <em>real</em> test is seeing how well Switch emulation performs.</p><p>That's where my first annoyance about the move to MediaTek came to mind when I heard the rumors. Graphics drivers for MediaTek devices are... well... they just don't quite stack up to Qualcomm. They'll easily handle systems with mature emulators, but once you start getting into Switch and Windows emulation, it's an entirely different story.</p><p>I won't bore you with the details, but basically, Qualcomm devices allow for the use of custom driver support and Vulkan extensions. If you ever hear about "Turnip" drivers, these are custom-compiled drivers that are used in a variety of emulators, including Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, and others.</p><p>These drivers can offer improved compatibility along with increased performance, which sounds great! Until you learn that you won't be able to use these custom drivers with MediaTek's Mali drivers. This ultimately means that if you try to emulate one of your favorite Switch games only to see that it gets between 10-15fps, you're simply out of luck.</p>

<p>There's one more thing about the Tab S10 Ultra that continues to bug me. For whatever reason, Samsung's "Ultra" tablet isn't available with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">cellular connection</a>. This has bugged me for the last few iterations, but after learning that those in Europe can choose between having Wi-Fi or cellular, I was hopeful that the S10 Ultra might be a deviation from that pattern.</p><p>Sure, it's not a problem with the Galaxy S10 Plus, so if you really want mobile connectivity, that's still an option. But what about those of us who prefer the larger display? Especially considering that the S10 Ultra is essentially a super-sized and Android-powered Surface Pro.</p><p>I understand that it would only make this already-expensive device cost even more. But at the same time, I don't understand Samsung's rationale when it comes to limiting or holding features from its "Ultra" devices.</p>

<p>For the first time in a few years, I feel like there's some real competition in the higher-end Android tablet space. While nothing else can really match up in terms of the display, there are now options that can keep up with Samsung's flagship tablets.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is the first that comes to mind, simply because of how much of an improvement it is over the previous model. We have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a gorgeous 3K LCD panel (which is great for PWM), and Open Canvas offers a different take on multitasking. Plus, even if you decide to pick up the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, it will still cost you less than the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>It's a similar story, at least on paper, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovos-trio-of-new-tablets-have-something-for-everyone">Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus</a>. This was announced at CES 2025 and has flown under the radar a bit, but maybe that will soon change. Lenovo, too, opted against going with the Snapdragon 8 Elite but instead relies on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. You'll also enjoy a 12.7-inch 3K display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 16GB of RAM. Lenovo includes both a stylus and a detachable keyboard in the box.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the big elephant in the room, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review" target="_blank">Apple's iPad Pro</a>. It has everything you could want from a laptop replacement — a big and vibrant screen, an excellent keyboard, and you can even get cellular if you want. However, the biggest caveat is that it's running iPadOS, and while that might be great for some, I still wish Apple would give us macOS on this hardware.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-3" alt="Console Launcher on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ8LiPqZCbMBBX2og6cSUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the biggest tablet that money can buy</li><li>You want a tablet that can replace your laptop</li><li>You're already entrenched in the Samsung ecosystem</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You want a tablet with cellular connectivity</li><li>You don't need a screen this massive</li><li>You want to enjoy retro emulation and need the best compatibility</li><li>You already have the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</li></ul>
<p>Frankly, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't for everyone. That statement would be true even if we had the Snapdragon 8 Elite or 8 Gen 3 over the Dimensity 9300+. It's cumbersome to use as a traditional tablet, even though the 14.6-inch display is perfect for media consumption and playing games.</p><p>If you were to ask me for a recommendation, I'd probably tell you to just get the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. With the extra money saved, you could spring for more storage or grab one with cellular connectivity. However, even that opens another can of worms when you look around at competing tablets with a similarly-sized screen.</p><p>That being said, there's a reason we chose this as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/android-central-best-of-2024-chromebooks-tablets">best tablet of 2024</a>. There's nothing quite like having a device of this size powered by Android. If you do decide to pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, I highly recommend enabling DeX as soon as you get everything set up. It just makes more sense than being confined to the traditional Android UI.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Some Google Maps users are running into a weird issue where their entire Timeline history is disappearing. No one’s sure why, but many suspect it has something to do with Google’s recent move to store location history directly on devices instead of in the cloud.</p><p>Google Maps' Timeline feature has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-rid-of-another-feature-on-web">undergone a major shift in how it handles location history</a>. For years, all that data was stored centrally, tied to your account. But starting in December of last year, Google made a big switch, meaning your movement history now stays on your phone instead of Google’s servers.</p><p>The company is giving users until June 9, 2025, to switch over to on-device location history. After that, anything still stored in the cloud will be gone for good.</p><p>Google’s push to decide what to do with years of location history left a lot of users sweating. With a deadline looming, people had to figure out how to save their data before it was too late. Now, some users are finding their Timeline history has vanished into thin air even before the deadline arrives.</p><p>Users are sounding the alarm on Reddit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5l70a/timeline_disappeared/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5bjps/timeline_deleted/" target="_blank">2</a>) about disappearing Google Maps Timeline data, and the issue is picking up steam, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-maps-timeline-missing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. In just the past day, tons of people have chimed in, saying their Timeline history has mysteriously vanished too.</p><p>People are reporting that years of their location history have suddenly vanished without a trace. Even though their Timeline is enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is showing the same frustrating message across the board: "No visits for this day."</p><p>To make matters worse, some users can’t even access their cloud backups anymore.</p><p>Some are pointing fingers at Google Maps’ shift to move location history from the cloud to your device as the likely culprit. The change was supposed to beef up privacy, but it might be causing this mess instead.</p><p>So far, the problem hasn’t popped up on our devices, which suggests it might not be hitting everyone. We’ve reached out to Google for answers and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>To date, most smartphone manufacturers have approached mobile AI by trying to throw a bunch of ideas at the wall and see what sticks. Samsung, Google, and Apple have all been implementing AI on their smartphones in a way that feels disjointed. Some features are better than others, and some are genuinely useful. However, it's tricky to describe Google AI, Galaxy AI, or Apple Intelligence as a unified experience.</p><p>After more than a year of sitting on the sidelines, Nothing is debuting its mobile AI with Nothing OS 3 on the Nothing Phone 3a series. It notably chose to work on these AI concepts instead of building the flagship Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">and I criticized that move</a>. More than six months later, the move might have paid off because the Essential Space on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> is arguably my favorite AI feature so far — and I've tried them all.</p><p>Essential Space is the hub for AI features in Nothing OS, and it's designed specifically for the Phone 3a series. Both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro have the Essential Key, which is a hardware button that lets you immediately save things to your Essential Space. It works anywhere in the operating system and can serve as a "memory" for things you do on your phone.</p><p>Nothing might've deserved more faith in the first place because it's impressive to see in hindsight how similar Essential Space sounds compared to Nothing CEO Carl Pei's teasers from June 2024. "It’s important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people’s faces," Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/1798369533889302576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1798369533889302576%7Ctwgr%5Eada3b2445a5f9d380c7d3cf95196b4d22c359f66%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fnothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>With a hardware Essential Key and an AI-based Essential Space, the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro seem to have delivered on the company's promises.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B" name="Essential-Key-Summarize" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f49DaBEU8jfZWcfp5dFD4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, the Essential Space is like an AI "memory" for your smartphone. If that goal sounds familiar, it should. It's the same ambitious feat other AI features like Pixel Screenshots and Microsoft Recall tried to achieve.</p><p>In practice, those tools aren't really serving as your smartphone's memory. They're more like record-keepers. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> will organize your screenshots, but it's on you to remember why you wanted to screenshot what you captured in the first place. So, the app becomes like the screenshots folder in your phone's gallery app — a wasteland for old and forgotten screen saves.</p><p>Unlike those offerings, Essential Space sets itself apart by doing more in one place. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">my hands-on with the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a>, I described Essential Space as being similar to a hybrid of Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Recorder, and Keep Notes. Those are some of my favorite apps on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, but I never knew I needed them to be more tightly integrated until I used the Nothing Phone 3a.</p>

<p>I can take a screenshot with the Essential Key by clicking it once and quickly add a text note or a voice note right there. This helps me chronicle why I saved something, and it also gives the Essential Space some context as to why it's important. From there, my screenshots will get sorted, notes analyzed, and voice recordings transcribed.</p><p>On a Google Pixel or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, I would've had to use multiple apps to get the same experience. It would've taken a lot longer, too.</p><p>The best part of Essential Space is what it can do on its own <em>after</em> you've taken a screenshot or recorded a note. It'll identify any action items or important details in your saves and can remind you of them later. For example, I added a discount coupon to the Essential Space and got a push notification a day before it was about to expire. On another occasion, I got a reminder to go on my next running workout after I saved a screenshot of the results from my last one.</p><p>To be clear, Nothing's implementation of mobile AI isn't perfect. The Essential Key is poorly designed, as it's too large, too shiny, and positioned too close to the power button. Meanwhile, the Essential Space app could use more features. It's a hub for your Essential Key saves, and only that.</p><p>The app is <em>so close</em> to being my go-to for notes and reminders, but there's no way to create a note, recording, or reminder in the app without using the Key.</p><p>But that's all forgivable because the whole experience works together seamlessly and lives under one roof — the Essential Space app. I can't say the same for Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and all the independent and disjointed features under those umbrellas.</p>

<p>AI's surge over the past few years has involved companies trying new things, seeing what works and what doesn't, and copying each other. As such, brands like Google and Samsung should take a close watch on what Nothing is doing with the Essential Space. It wouldn't take much for either company to develop something similar for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>They already have the individual features built, and some of them are better than what Nothing offers. They just haven't figured out how to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense, and somehow, it seems like Nothing has.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Extensions are now "Apps," although everything works the same, just with a fresh name.</li><li>"Apps" now replaces "Extensions" everywhere on Android, iOS, and web.</li><li>Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is also the new tech under the hood, promising a faster, smarter experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has swapped out the name “Gemini Extensions” for something simpler and snappier: "Apps." Along with the new name, these apps are also getting a boost with a version of Gemini 2.0 that makes them faster and more efficient.</p><p>If you’ve been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> on your phone or computer lately, you might’ve noticed that the old "Extensions" menu is now called "Apps." Google confirmed the switch in its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/release-notes-03-07-2025.html" target="_blank">Workspace Updates blog</a>.</p><p>Google has made it clear that this name change is just a surface-level update. This means that everything works the same as before, so your experience won’t really change.</p><p>That said, a bit of an adjustment period is inevitable as people get used to the new label. So, if you find yourself pausing for a second to spot the "Apps" menu, you’re not alone—it’ll just take a little time to feel familiar.</p><p>Gemini Apps give Google’s AI chatbot the ability to connect with all sorts of web services and mobile features, going way beyond just answering questions. From pulling up your calendar to summarizing videos or kicking off an audio stream, it’s designed to handle real-time tasks that go beyond basic information lookup.</p><p>Google has fully rolled out the name switch on Android, iOS, and web. You’ll see "Apps" popping up everywhere now, replacing "Extensions" in settings, account menus, and all the main features of the platform.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company is no stranger to renaming and reshuffling its services, but this change seems more intentional. This latest shift feels like a move to make these features feel more like a natural, built-in part of the Gemini ecosystem.</p><p>On top of the name change, Google is rolling out something new under the hood: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Google says it’ll give users a smoother, smarter experience, especially if you’re someone who leans on these tools a lot.</p><p>Google has been steadily evolving its reasoning models. It started with the first release in December, then rolled out an improved version for developers in January. Last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental made its way to all Gemini users</a>, whether you’re on the free plan or paying for premium.</p>

There's a bit of Google in just about every corner at the show, but in the midst of all the excitement on the show floor, I was able to sit with Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform, to discuss what to look forward to in 2025. And while AI underscored nearly everything on the docket, we also dove into Android 16's accelerated timeline and the plan to improve update support across OEMs.</p><p>Improving Android updates across the board seems to be a major focal point for the company this year, from improving the timing of device launches to making it easier for OEMs to support software longer than they traditionally have. And while this may not be as exciting as new Gemini features, getting everyone on the same page with Android updates is just as important, if not more so.</p>

<h2 id="android-s-new-schedule-2">Android's new schedule</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer preview</a> commenced, Google announced that it was making a major change to its schedule. Instead of following its usual launch timing, the stable update would launch sooner, specifically in Q2. This means we can expect the update to arrive by June at the latest, putting it months ahead of previous releases.</p><p>When I asked Chau about the accelerated timeline, he said there are multiple reasons why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is coming so much sooner.</p><p>"The first is, we're getting feedback from our OEM partners that 'Hey, the earlier you can release, the more likely we can push new [software] when we launch a new handset in that same year.'</p><p>Because if you look at some of the biggest releases during the year, if we're releasing a new Android version in August or September, it's really hard to release a phone that same year with the latest release, and then you have to wait however many months before you get the latest Android release."</p><p>This was especially true last year when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> launched in August last year without the latest Android release. Even though the phones arrived a bit earlier compared to the previous release, many found it strange that Google waited until <em>after</em> they were released to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Many flagship or sub-flagship launches happen in the second half of the year, which made the timing of previous Android releases tricky. Samsung is one of those companies that launch new phones in July or August, which means they usually come with last year's software before the company launches a beta and eventually the stable version later in the year, <em>usually</em> starting in Q4.</p><p>With Android 16 set to arrive much sooner, this <em>should</em> help companies avoid that awkward launch window after a new update has been released. That means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> should come with Android 16 out of the box. The new schedule means new phones from other OEMs can get the new software and hopefully be updated sooner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.88%;"><img id="FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY" name="Android-16-Release-Schedule" alt="The beta release schedule for Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1442" height="330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chau also notes that another reason the company moved up the Android 16 update is because the company "wanted to be able to move faster with respect to APIs." And while the move is partially AI-driven, he says that, ultimately, it just makes sense.</p><p>"As quickly as the market is moving, and as quickly as our developers need to be able to move in order to build new functionality, especially around AI, we need to make sure that we can add that capability and those APIs multiple times a year.</p><p>So, in order to do that, it didn't make sense to release something in August or September, and then, like, a couple months later put out another release with an API update."</p>

<p>Updating a phone is one thing, but it's another thing to continue pushing updates for a phone for years after the device is launched. The Pixel made the first major push for extended update support, promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS upgrades and security updates</a>. Samsung then followed suit with its flagship Galaxy phones.</p><p>But that kind of support hasn't been common in the Android space, and it definitely takes a lot of resources to provide it. This is why the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-collaborates-with-google-bringing-extended-support-to-certain-android-phones">announcement</a> from Qualcomm and Google is such a big deal, making it easier for OEMs to support their devices for up to eight years. That said, while we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-commitment-to-7-years-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-magic-series">Honor join the seven-year club</a>, it's ultimately up to OEMs if they want to bring that level of support to devices. Chau says he hopes the move will encourage more OEMs to follow.</p><p>"One of the driving factors around this is sustainability, of course, but really, it's so that you can keep your devices longer. And if you decide to pass that device down or return it, you're able to retain more [secondary market] value." Chau says the hope is that longer support for devices will help drive more adoption of Android phones, with consumers knowing their devices will remain secure for years to come.</p><p>In fact, this is partially what drove some long-term Pixel users that I know to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/convincing-friends-ditch-older-pixels-buy-google-pixel-6a">upgrade from their Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices</a> after support ended for them. Though they were intrigued by the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a>, they eventually pulled the trigger when the Pixel 7 launched with improved update support (which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">since been extended</a> by another two years), especially since they were not planning to upgrade again for a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL" name="Google-Pixel-7-Pro-hazel-camera-module.jpg" alt="Holding the hazel Google Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's Pixel phones have arguably the best software update policy, and now, that level of support can be extended to other devices, although it wasn't without its challenges.</p><p>"One of the biggest barriers was SoC support," Chau notes, highlighting that the transition to Tensor SoC helped bring that level of commitment to Pixel phones.</p><p>"One of the challenges, of course, is Linux as the underlying operating system. The long-term support period for different versions of Linux kernels was actually shortened. So, we had to work with the SoC vendors and our partners to make sure that we could actually upgrade the kernel." He notes that this has been very difficult in the past, which highlights the importance of this new collaboration with Qualcomm.</p><p>For now, the eight years of support is supported on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which powers today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. However, this will also extend to future 8-series chips as well as future 7-series chips, which are expected later this year.</p><p>What's more, Qualcomm notes that this support can lower costs for OEMs interested in adding extended software support for their phones. As someone who loves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, I hope this means the company <del>can</del> will add better (and faster) support to its newer devices.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates">Android 16 still in beta</a>, Chau wasn't able to talk about what we can expect from the stable update later this year, but he did note that despite some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">rhetoric around extended update support</a>, Google is focused on making each update better than the last and making things more efficient.</p><p>"We've promised seven years of updates on Pixel, and we worked with Qualcomm to get to eight years. I see a lot of sentiment, shall we say, like 'Who cares about eight years because it's going to make it worse' and all these other things. We're really working hard to make sure that that's not the case.</p><p>Every release, we want to make sure it is better than the last one, including performance, battery life, etc."</p><p>Chau recognizes that some features will require more power, which is par for the course when it comes to updates. We recently saw this in action with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">features that require the new Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for AI processing, which aren't available on previous models. It's also just as common with Pixels due to more powerful chips being able to handle more power-hungry tasks.</p><p>Still, Chau says Google tries to offset this by finding gains elsewhere, which can sometimes mean a bump in performance when a new update rolls around, even if a feature or two are sacrificed due to a lack of power.</p><p>Ultimately, the question becomes, "How do we make the releases better so that we're not making your phone worse?"</p><p>Fortunately, with the new Android 16 release schedule and a promise to help OEMs update their phones longer (and hopefully faster), 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for Android updates.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New Google Photos API changes are cutting off automatic syncing for some digital photo frames like Aura and Cozyla.</li><li>Starting March 17, Aura users will need to manually add photos, and Cozyla users are in the same boat.</li><li>Google announced these changes last September, and they officially take effect on March 31.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s recent changes to how third-party apps can access Google Photos have thrown a wrench into things, causing headaches for a bunch of digital photo frame makers.</p><p>For years, digital photo frame companies have used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>’ tools to easily pull in your pictures and keep them updated. But now, thanks to some recent tweaks to those tools, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623306/google-photos-digital-photo-frame-auto-sync-going-away" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reported, those handy connections are getting cut off, leaving a few digital photo frames in the lurch.</p><p>Google’s updates to its Photos API were meant to boost user privacy, but they’ve also disabled automatic syncing for some devices, like Aura and Cozyla frames. This means those once-smooth slideshows of your favorite pet album won’t update like they used to.</p><p>Before the API changes, Aura’s app let users browse their Photos library and pick what to display on their digital frames. The ‘auto-add’ feature made it even easier by automatically syncing new photos to selected albums.</p><p>However, starting March 17, Aura is pulling the plug on its automatic Google Photos sync, as Senior Director of Communications Jenisse Curry confirmed. That means you’ll have to manually upload photos through the Google Photos app if you want to share new pictures with family on your Aura frame.</p><p>Cozyla is jumping on the same bandwagon and ditching its Google Photos auto-sync too, as per a Reddit thread. So, if you’re rocking a Cozyla frame, get ready to switch to manual uploads for your photo updates.</p><p>Google first unveiled the news about its Photos API changes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/photos/support/updates" target="_blank">back in September</a>, and now it's finally rolling out on March 31. According to Google, the updates aim to beef up user privacy.</p><p>While Google is phasing out this beloved feature, the tech giant is also working on new ways to let devices securely access your Photos library. Interestingly, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/326122731/more-eligible-devices-for-ambient-displays" target="_blank">recently hinted</a> at expanding Google Photos integration to more devices, like smart fridges and newer digital photo frames.</p><p>Google isn’t ditching digital photo frames altogether, but with backend changes in the works, existing frames could face some temporary or even long-term hiccups. The full details are still under wraps, so it’s a wait-and-see situation.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a capable mid-range gaming laptop; you've liked other Chromebook or Acer options in the past; you want a laptop with a large, vivid screen featuring a high enough refresh rate for fast-paced gaming.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a small keyboard and would be willing to sacrifice display size; you're looking for a laptop that includes a touch display.</p><p>The Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE is a powerful laptop, and Android Central's first pick in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook#section-best-for-gaming">best Chromebook for gaming </a>category. The 16-inch display comes with a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, ideal for gaming, as well as an ergonomic, LED-backlit keyboard with multiple customization options. It also sports an impressive battery life and performance that users love.</p><p>The Intel Core 5 120U backs solid performance for the price point, and this particular model features 8GB of RAM, though the laptop can also be upgraded to 16GB. As for connectivity, the Plus 516 GE includes two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, an ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>While it is a great pick, it's also worth noting that it isn't a premium gaming laptop, just a good Chromebook for gaming purposes. Some prefer a more portable laptop option, or a true premium gaming pick. If you have extra money to spend, it could certainly be worth upgrading, but this laptop has a lot to offer given the already-low price point.</p>

However, I'd go so far as to say that there is <em>one</em> company Google should license its technology, and it's not Samsung.</p><p>Despite releasing the first phone with an on-device assistant, Apple sat back and watched as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa quickly surpassed Siri. While minor tweaks and "improvements" have been made over the years, Siri isn't anywhere near as reliable or valuable as Assistant and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. It reached a tipping point with iOS 18, as Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">announced</a> it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring an enhanced version of Siri.</p><p>In addition to providing easy access to ChatGPT, Apple also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">stated</a> that Siri would offer Personalized Responses and On-Screen Awareness. Those features were already supposed to have been available, but Apple continues to struggle to get them out of the gate. Not only that, the "real" Siri upgrade might not be released for at least another year, if not longer.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It might not be until 2027 before Apple releases the Siri overhaul that the iPhone needs. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This version of Siri is expected to be more akin to what we have with Google Gemini on Android. It's expected to be more conversational, along with actually performing tasks the same way that Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLM models do. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reports that this is initially expected to debut at WWDC 2025 before being rolled out this time next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rumor recently surfaced claiming that Google would introduce an all-new AI assistant named '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">Pixel Sense</a>,' which would essentially be the all-encompassing digital assistant that we've been waiting for. Instead of relying on different apps or "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15146780?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Gemini Gems</a>," Pixel Sense is expected to leverage and process any of the user data that it's allowed to collect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d" name="visual-intelligence-iphone-16-pro-1.jpeg" alt="Apple Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2268" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given Apple's consistent struggles and delays in developing its own AI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai might want to consider calling up Apple CEO Tim Cook and saying, "Hey, we can help you with that." It's not like Google isn't already helping out, as Apple's Visual Intelligence already leans on Google for its results, basically implementing Google Lens with Apple's UI.</p><p>I'm not suggesting this just because I use an iPhone. If I want the best, I just reach into my other pocket and grab my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. I think Google would be well-served to try and get this in front of as many people as it can.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-13" alt="Gemini showing a Rick Astley video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is constantly talking about how it wants to continue improving Gemini and AI. It's partially why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series is packed with so many Gemini-powered features while other features make their way to the broader Android market. However, if Google wants to make the biggest impact, serving up Gemini on the iPhone is the best way I can think of.</p><p>It's not like iOS doesn't already have the foundation to make something like this possible. With iOS 18, Apple added "Extensions," which is how you are able to access ChatGPT when asking Siri a question that it can't answer. So, it's not entirely inconceivable that we could see a similar implementation.</p><p>As it currently stands, there's a dedicated Gemini app on the Apple App Store after it was initially integrated into the Google app. There was even a recent update that introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-iphones-slight-rework-lock-screen-apple-update">Gemini lock screen widgets</a>, making it even easier for you to talk to Gemini. However, even a lock screen widget won't be enough for some, as you might not think about it when you're in a hurry or prefer using the Side Button to invoke Siri.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expected to launch this new AI as a "Pixel 10 exclusive." And while I understand the desire to keep features tied to specific devices for a period of time, Google could still choose to expand it beyond the Pixel and Android ecosystem.</p><p>Barring any hiccups, we could see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> launched in August, with the iPhone 17 landing in September. That gives Google about a month of exclusivity for Pixel Sense before the two companies make some type of surprise announcement. Or instead of making Pixel Sense available on launch day for the iPhone, wait a month or two (probably after the holiday shopping rush) and release it as part of Apple's pre-Christmas/New Year break iOS update.</p><p>Then again, maybe the reason why we don't have a Gemini extension for iOS already is because it could likely spell the end of the Pixel line. What's the point in buying a Pixel if you can get the same experience on an iPhone?</p>

It's a refreshing change of pace to see Meta let its engineers be so geekily passionate about their work.</p><p>Meta's Reality Labs team leaked a lot of information about future Quest headsets and AR glasses until Meta started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-issues-a-stern-warning-to-employees-about-leaks" target="_blank">issuing anti-leak warnings to staff</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/labor/621059/meta-fires-20-employee-leakers" target="_blank">firing accused leakers</a>.</p><p>The tech world has always been hyper-fixated on secrecy while despising whistleblowers, leaving its biggest fans dependent on unreliable leaks and fake rumors as they wait for new products. By the time a product launches, the waters are muddied by leaks with incomplete or exaggerated information, making a device look worse before the engineers are allowed to explain the context.</p><p>So that's what makes Meta's current approach with Meta Orion so refreshing. Yes, this is a public proof-of-concept of Reality Labs' work rather than a marketable product, but by eking out information about these glasses <em>now</em> instead of waiting until 2027, it helps inform the public on the challenges of AR glasses engineering and why they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending billions on research</a> to address them.</p><p>Whether you're an old "Glasshole," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> owner waiting for an upgrade, or a Quest fan curious about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">AI glasses</a> in general, I highly recommend you read Meta's three blog posts for yourself. But I'll summarize the highlights below.</p>

<p>In Meta's blog post, titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-custom-silicon-chips-ip-blocks-accelerators-ar-algorithms-energy-efficiency-reality-labs/" target="_blank"><strong>How Our Custom Silicon & Chips Are Revolutionizing AR</strong></a>, Meta explains why its AR glasses are "completely dependent" upon custom silicon instead of mobile-style chipsets.</p><p>"The glasses form factor can only dissipate so much heat, and it can only accommodate so much battery capacity," the post explains. So "if you hold constant the thermal and battery capacities, the only way to deliver a given experience is to optimize the silicon."</p><p>Director of SoC Solutions Robert Shearer explains that they had to "reduce power consumption by a factor of 100" before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> glasses would work.</p><p>Some of that came down to the wireless puck, but even that required "custom compression protocols to reduce bandwidth and power consumption as data moved from the compute puck to the display, says Director of Product Management Neeraj Choubey. He also described how they used machine learning to reduce the power needed for on-glasses eye and hand tracking.</p><p>The post proceeds to explain how this team also designed the custom silicon in the Orion microLED displays. Display Architecture Technical Director Mike Yee explains how they had to reduce the gap between pixel centers from "tens of microns" on phones to "the single digits," which would only work on silicon.</p><p><em>Then,</em> they needed to develop a "custom power management chip" that fit in the "tiny corner" of Orion's displays to power the holographic content.</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the blog post, which is mostly a platform for this team to brag about how they're "breaking free from traditional mental models" to make custom silicon. But considering the years of reports about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-laying-off-reality-labs-employees-behind-custom-silicon">Meta laying off this team</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-mediatek-announce-partnership-custom-ar-silicon">relying on MediaTek</a> for its silicon, I'd say they deserve some time in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-silicon-carbide-waveguides-ar-glasses-large-field-of-view/" target="_blank"><strong>Our Silicon Carbide Waveguides & the Path to Orion’s Large FoV</strong></a> explains how Meta took advantage of a surplus of silicon-carbide material made for EV cars to make it a "viable option for AR glasses" because of its "high refractive index."</p><p>Optical Scientist Pasqual Rivera says traditional glass lenses make AR glasses an unsightly rainbow "disco." Silicon carbide was initially so "nitrogen-doped" that it was too dark to ever be used for glasses, but Meta's team realized that it's a "total game changer" with incredible clarity when it's not optimized for cars.</p><p>AR Waveguides Tech Lead Giuseppe Calafiore explained how they had to stack multiple glass plates to hit a refractive index of 1.8, making glasses "prohibitively large and ugly." So they tried different materials and eventually settled on silicon carbide, which can hit a 2.7 index with a single plate for better "etendue," aka 50% better light spread for a wider field of view (FoV).</p><p>The post explains that wider FoV on AR glasses can cause "ghost images and rainbows" but that silicon carbide has properties to reduce them, as well as better thermal conductivity.</p><p>That said, the problem is undoubtedly price. Meta's post concludes with Director of Research Science Barry Silverstein saying, "We’re seeing signs that it’s possible to significantly reduce the cost," but that implies that for now, AR glasses either have to settle for worse materials or cost an arm and a leg for a functional display.</p>

<p>The third blog post about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-compute-puck-reality-labs-next-computing-platform" target="_blank"><strong>Orion's computing puck</strong></a> explains why Meta quickly abandoned the idea of using a phone to power its glasses because "demanding performance requirements would drain the phone battery and suck away compute capacity from phone use cases."</p><p>It then goes behind the scenes on how they envisioned the puck as a fully functional controller for AR games with 6DoF sensors and haptics, but that they've turned off those functions for the final version to focus more on eye/hand tracking and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">EMG band</a>. Still, one could imagine enthusiasts and devs getting those functions working if they wanted to.</p><p>That's partially why I think this blog post isn't just about boasting. It explains to skeptics why they chose a puck instead of a phone, curtails any false rumors about the puck being a controller in the final product, and explains the power demands AR glasses have that necessitate this weight in your pocket.</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> brings me back to my original point: I want more companies to let their engineers geek out and explain themselves <em>before</em> products reach the final stage. It primes journalists and hobbyists about the technical side of these products well before launch so they're less reliant on leaks while also building up hype for products and features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/valve-asus-and-samsung-vr-headsets-fill-niche-that-quest-abandoned">Leaked XR headsets like Valve Deckard</a> have had VR super-nerds pouring over Valve's code for years, looking for hints of what to expect. I'm not saying Valve should reveal its product early, but it's been a long 5+ years since the Index launch with almost nothing VR-related aside from the occasional Steam Link update. Some behind-the-scenes info on what they've been working on would've been a nice nod to its patient fans.</p><p>I doubt Meta will let its engineers loose to talk about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> anytime soon, nor its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">leaked smart glasses</a>. But since we all know these devices are coming, it'd be nice if Meta let loose enough to give us some hints and let engineers brag publicly about their work instead of assuming it can fire everyone until the leaks stop.</p>

This made us think about what exactly the company was thinking while creating these devices.</p><p>For instance, Samsung's claw-like tri-fold, which looks like a flip but would fold on both ends, leaving half an inch of gap in the center. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Tecno Spark Slim</a>, which looks cool and is the world's slimmest phone with a 5,200mAh batter, measuring just 5.75mm in thickness. It gets better, at the rear, the camera bar looks like a futuristic robot's eyes, connected by LEDs with unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels. Hope you're taking notes, Samsung!</p><p>Xiaomi took accessorizing to another level, with a custom Xiaomi 15 showcased at the event that had a large magnetic ring on its rear that could attach a bigger camera lens, instantly converting your phone into a DSLR camera.</p><p>Some of the other things that the AC team spotted were Honor's AI-powered robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with, Nubia Focus 2 Ultra, which features a ring around the camera housing that can be physically rotated to control the zoom, UAE's Humanoid robot that kinda creeped them out and more.</p>

<p>How much should anyone be paying for a phone case? The question is highly debatable, but I'm sure you've asked yourself this before. After all, smartphone cases these days range from as low as $10 or maybe even less and can go all the way past the $100 mark.</p><p>I know it sounds insane to spend $100 or more on a phone case. For a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap phone that costs about $500</a>, that's already a major fraction of the price of the device itself! As ridiculous as it may seem to be, sometimes it's actually worth the splurge. There are many reasons why you'd want such an expensive phone case.</p><p>But before dishing out my own opinions, I'd like to share what others have told me regarding the matter. I went around asking my colleagues how much they were <em>willing</em> to spend on a case on average. Their like-minded answers highlighted a pattern in buying phone cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-most-people-prefer-to-spend-on-cases-2">What most people prefer to spend on cases</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6" name="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch - 1.JPG" alt="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4288" height="2412" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Android Central writers how much they'd be willing to spend on a phone case. Here's what some of them had to say on the matter. Phones editor Nicholas Sutrich says his max is $20 "unless it's something really special like a Thinborne." Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong had a similar response, saying he'd spend about "$20-ish on Amazon but much more if it’s a brand I trust AND the case has design elements and materials that justify the higher price."</p><p>Meanwhile, news editor Nandika Ravi says she'd spend "Anywhere between $50 to $60 at the most."</p>
<p>Typically speaking, most of Android Central's staff find it appropriate to spend about $20 on an everyday phone cover. The only exceptions come in when a notable brand is involved.</p><p>Why is there an exception when a popular brand comes into play? According to the vox populi, it's all about the build quality and reliability of the brand. Trustworthy phone case makers ensure your phone cover is made of the highest grade materials and actually delivers on the drop protection promises made.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I once paid for an official leather case and realized my running lifestyle made it a waste: it got sweat-stained and ruined, so I had to replace it after a few months. Now, I try to keep it simple. I do pick the more reputable companies, but I wouldn’t pay above $40.</p><figcaption><cite>Michael L Hicks, Senior Editor, Wearables & AR/VR</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>When a name brand is involved, most members of our team — and probably the general public — are willing to stretch their budget to a certain extent.</p>
<h2 id="why-brands-matter-2">Why brands matter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Comparison.jpg" alt="MagSafe accessories on an iPhone and Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Can you get a cheap case from retailers like Amazon? Yes, of course you can. However, the issue arises with no-name brands selling poor-quality silicone, low-grade TPU, or faux leather phone covers, touting them to be "military-grade drop-resistant" when the truth is far from it.</p><p>This is exactly why brands matter and why some folks are willing to spend up to $60 on a protective case for their smartphone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save. If a company like Spigen promises 20ft drop protection, you know that a research & development team actually put the phone cover to the test. It's no wonder an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-case-saves-iphone-from-16000-foot-fall">iPhone survived a 16,000ft fall from a moving airplane in a Spigen case</a>.</p><p>Let's not forget about the insanely slim yet incredulously rugged Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Sutrich doubted the structural integrity of such a minimalist Pixel 9 case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">in his review</a>, but then he dropped it on concrete. This eye-wateringly expensive phone case will set you back $90, but you'll also get the satisfaction of knowing it can live through anything.</p><p>Thus, when a brand like CASETiFY promises impact-proofing on its bumper covers, you can rely on the case to be that tough in actuality. Because if it isn't so, unsatisfied customers know where to find them and how to shame them, perhaps going as far as suing for false advertisement.</p><p>Good luck trying to do any of that with the $3 knock-off you got from Temu. Accountability is non-existent in that scenario.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-2">The bottom line</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y" name="Tudia-cases-nothing-phone-2-honor-magic-6-pro-boox-palma-02.jpg" alt="Tudia cases for the Onyx Boox Palma, Nothing Phone 2, and Honor Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's where I pipe in with my own thoughts. I've been covering phone accessories for several years now, so I can positively reassure you. Brands are important, but that doesn't mean you need to spend $100 for a functional and sturdy phone case.</p><p>Plenty of awesome brands are also accessibly priced. Just look at Spigen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tudia-phone-cases-stock-up">TUDIA</a>, TORRAS, and ESR, to name a few. Even their flagship phone cases for Samsung and Google are priced around $20 or less. I could go on and on, but my point has been made.</p><p>Names like these are proof that a tight budget doesn't automatically compromise the quality of the phone case you can afford.</p><p>At the end of the day, buy a phone case from a reliable brand that fits your budget. It doesn't matter if it's $15 or $150. As long as you do your research on the brand's history, you'll be solid.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9a's release may be just around the corner, and while we anticipate learning more about the phone — several leaks have been coming in hot.</p><p>The most recent one gave us a good look at how the alleged hardware and design of the device. Coming from avid tipster<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1897836775290085404" target="_blank"> Evan Blass</a> are what seem to be official marketing images of the Pixel 9a. In an X (previously Twitter) post, Blass showed off alleged renders of the mid-range phone.</p><p>In terms of the hardware, the Pixel 9a seems to have flat edges, rounded corners, and an end-to-end screen. Additionally, the images confirm what the previous leaks have been pointing towards— the mid-range device could be losing the signature Pixel camera visor. Instead, it will have a pill-shaped housing flush with the rear panel of the phone.</p><p>However, in another image showing the phone horizontally, a sliver of the camera bump seems to exist— indicating that the company may not be letting go of the bump altogether.</p>

<p>As indicated in previous leaks, the Pixel 9a could come in four colorways: Black, silver, pink, and Lilac, but the official names of these colors remain under wraps so far. That said, in the subsequent thread, Blass shows off some of the Gemini's features that could supposedly show up on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>To start, one image shows a person triggering Gemini by holding down the power button. The other images seem to indicate that the phone will come with Android 15's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft protection</a> and several cameras, calling, and general Pixel ecosystem features.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-renders-cases-and-fcc-listing-leak" target="_blank">leak that popped up </a>earlier this week indicated that the Pixel 9a could come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel">satellite connectivity</a> out of the box. The mid-range phone is said to have shown up for FCC certification with the digital label explaining, "The satellite feature on this device must be turned off at all times while on board an aircraft by turning on airplane mode," which is similar to what showed up on the flagship model as well.</p><p>It is important to note that several features that show up in leaks may or may not make it to the actual device. However, here's a detailed list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">what we expect</a> to see from the upcoming Google Pixel 9a.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 9 users can now shoot pictures and videos from different angles as Google is starting to roll out the new Connected Cameras feature to these phones (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/pixel-9-connected-cameras/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Connected Cameras is a feature that was announced along with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel update</a> that came in early this week. This will allow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> owners to connect to another camera placed at a distance (either a GoPro or a Pixel phone) and use it to live stream and record videos.  Users can livestream through any of the supported social media applications like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc., while being able to use the in-app filters on their videos.</p><p>This is particularly useful for people who want to set their phones aside to show off a skill or share their products during a livestream or even while simply biking with their GoPro.</p><p>To enable this feature, users need to head to the Pixel's <strong>Settings > Connected devices > Connection preferences > Connected Cameras</strong>. Here, you'll need to toggle the option on, as it doesn't appear to be enabled by default.</p><p>Once turned on, a floating "Camera Picker" icon will appear when using supported apps. This allows you to add, remove, or disconnect a remote camera as well as switch devices.</p><p>That said, when the Camera Picker isn't in use on the above-mentioned social media apps, it remains minimized. Users can also disable the icon by touching and holding it, then dragging it to the "X" at the bottom of their screen, Google explained on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15985851?visit_id=638769908975773396-2413751535&p=connected_cameras&rd=1">help page</a>.</p>

<p>As of now, this feature is only available for Pixel 9 series devices. It can support secondary cameras using the Pixel 6 and later or the GoPro 10 and later, updated to the latest software version on them.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to note that users can only connect to one additional remote device at a time, and these devices need to be signed into the same Google account. You can switch the connected camera, but you'll have to disconnect the first one.</p>

However, the company also has a number of concepts to show off that make our current phones look outright boring by comparison.</p><p>Of course, the most interesting concepts we saw from TECNO are devices like the multi-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">Phantom Ultimate 2</a> and the ultra-thin Spark Slim. These aren't what I'm referring to, although they do give us a good idea of where TECNO wants to go. It's the other concepts that got me excited about what our phones could look and feel like in the near future.</p>

<p>On display were several dummy models made using various materials, with the idea being to use sustainable or renewable options for phone designs. Among them was a model with a back made using coconut core. This is the outer shell of a coconut that is usually used to make various products like floor mats, mattresses, and other things. It won't smell like coconut, but it's a firm alternative to glass that looks very clean and feels great in hand.</p><p>On the opposite end, TECNO had a model made with used coffee grounds. This actually makes sense because Transsion, TECNO's parent company, has a coffee business in China, and what better way to bring the two together?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J" name="TECNO-coffee-grounds-material-concept" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a back made of coffee grounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design-wise, it's perhaps not as attractive as the coconut coir, but it does look quite unique and could appeal to anyone who likes the more raw look. Furthermore, it actually smells quite good, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like coffee. Imagine how nice it would be to get a bit of a pick-me-up from a quick whiff of your phone!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ" name="TECNO-Multi-Glass-Fiber" alt="A concept TECNO phone with glass fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, TECNO had a phone made with an industry-first multi-colored glass fiber. For this, TECNO used a Jacquard weaving technique, with the end result being a phone that looks like it's studded out in diamonds. In fact, the company used what looks like a jewel in place of the red indicator light next to the cameras and the "o" in "Camon." It's a rather stunning design that can make any phone look premium.</p>
<h2 id="switching-things-up-2">Switching things up</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ" name="TECNO-photochromic-Cellulose-Acetate" alt="Concept TECNO phones with different colors activated with a UV light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO's concepts aren't only about using alternative materials. The company also wants to give us the freedom to change the look of our phones. These proofs-of-concept were probably my favorite of the bunch, as they added a bit of a dynamic nature to the designs.</p><p>Among these devices were a series of phones that use photochromic cellulose acetate, which allows the back cover to change color when exposed to UV light. The company had three phones set up, all of which appeared fairly normal at first glance. But when a representative shined a UV light onto them, they all changed color: one blue, one pink, and one green.</p><p>While I wouldn't expect anyone to carry a UV light around, I can only imagine how cool it could be to have my phone change color whenever I walked outside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J" name="TECNO-Display-Electronic-Slurry" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a DES back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3782" height="2127" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more interesting is the concept that uses Display Electronic Slurry (DES) technology, as seen above. It essentially turns a phone's back panel into a video player with a high DPI and refresh rate, although it reminded me a lot of an E Ink display. Still, it was pretty cool seeing the phones flash with different images, and I imagine you could deck out your phone with whatever designs you want, switching things up to match your mood, outfit, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J" name="TECNO-Starry-Optical-Fiber" alt="The Phantom V Flip 2 with TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And, of course, I can't forget about TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber. The company unveiled this at CES and integrated it into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a>, embedding ultra-fine optical fibers and LED lights in a smartphone back cover. The result is a very out-of-this-world effect that can change between four different modes, and TECNO claims it doesn't impede battery life.</p>

<p>Smartphone design has become pretty boring lately, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> launching as variations of glass and aluminum slabs, and the only way to stand out is with a unique color selection or an outlandish camera design. Look no further than any Samsung phone if you want an indication of how some of the most popular phones have thrown in the design towel.</p><p>Fortunately, we are starting to see more companies switching things up with materials like vegan leather and ceramic. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">TECNO Spark Slim</a> has a stainless steel back that looks like it came out of a Nubian starship from Star Wars, with a camera bar that brings the entire package home with LED lights that run between the dual cameras on either side.</p><p>Unlike the days of dumb phones where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-lg-downfall-made-phones-boring">companies like Nokia</a> could launch the most ridiculous designs (Lipstick phone, anyone?), the modern smartphone era doesn't have the luxury of particularly unique designs. Seeing how far TECNO is going to give our slab phones a new lease on life gives me hope that smartphone design can one day be exciting again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly slipped a new addition into an Android Auto version under development that could positively affect a driver's experience.</p><p>A small, iterative update to Android Auto's 13.9 beta was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/android-auto-temperature-controls-code/">9to5Google</a> with new code teasing a set of new controls. The post states Google has added code in preparation to introduce vehicle air controls. The code seems a little strange, considering it doesn't specify <em>temperature </em>(like hot or cold), specifically.</p><p>What was found only states the pressure at which the air would flow out from your car's vents. According to the APK dive, Android Auto currently contains the following strings: "control_temperature_hi," "control_temperature_lo," and an "off" setting.</p><p>It seems odd that Google would opt for "high" and "low" titles instead of "hot" and "cold" for your car's heat and AC. Unfortunately, the true functions of these newly spotted settings are still unknown as the publication couldn't surface anything concrete.</p><p>If anything, these strings could be the early makings of a truly fleshed out temperature control experience with more to offer. As previously stated, this was found in v13.9.151004 of Android Auto. The post reiterates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/android-auto-13-9-update-rolling-out/">v13.9 beta update</a> rolled out for testers a week ago, which was lackluster in terms of major updates. Google was mostly fixing bugs and altering the language of some of its features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6" name="AAWireless-Two-adapter-next-screen" alt="AAWireless Two adapter next to aftermarket infotainment head unit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also makes us wonder if Google will somehow make its temperature controls vibe with Android Auto's supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-gemini-demo-showcase-reported">Gemini integration</a>. Earlier this week, a demo video surfaced showcasing how Android Auto and Gemini could work together to assist drivers. The AI contained basic functions for playing music through Spotify and answering questions about major landmarks. However, it was clear that Google may need to tweak how it helps users plan a trip.</p><p>The AI was pretty chatty, but offered very little specifics in the early stages of its "affordable trip" breakdown. It wasn't until the end where Gemini shaped up and offered some useful insights.</p><p>If Google is working to apply proper temperature controls in Android Auto, perhaps users could utilize it with Gemini — if things work out, that is.</p><p>Elsewhere, Android Auto's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-appears-to-be-expanding-its-horizons-beyond-just-cars">13.5 update from January</a> showed clues about Google's eventual addition of more vehicles. It seems the company is preparing to welcome motorcycles into its automobile OS ecosystem.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why I put up with Windows on a regular basis is some of the ways it integrates with Android. One such feature is Link to Windows, also known as Phone Link, which allows you to use your phone without actually needing to pick it up.</p><p>Even when it was introduced back in 2018, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Phone Link</a> wasn't the app to offer this kind of integration. However, it was the first time that we saw this kind of experience built into Windows or macOS. The app has continued to evolve, including the ability to actually mirror your phone's screen right on your Windows machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some Phone Link features, such as screen mirroring, have been limited to only working with certain devices. Until last year, only Samsung phones were available with Link to Windows built-in, but that's no longer the case as it's now being baked into more and more phones.</p><p>Another app was released in 2018 by the name of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy">Scrcpy (screen copy)</a>, which has continued to see regular updates since its initial release. The key benefit of using this over Phone Link is that you can use Scrcpy with <em>any </em>Android device. Just download the app on your Windows computer, enable USB debugging from your phone, fire up Scrcpy, and voila!</p><p>Over the years, quite a few forks of Scrcpy have been released, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NetrisTV/ws-scrcpy" target="_blank">Ws-scrcpy,</a> which is a "web client prototype," or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy" target="_blank">QtScrcpy</a>, which provides more settings to customize. However, I was recently preusing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">Droid-ify</a> and saw an app called ScrcpyForAndroid. Initially, I just figured it was a way to enhance the regular Scrcpy app, but boy, was I wrong.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-2" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of offering more functionality between your Android device and Windows, ScrcpyForAndroid lets you achieve the same thing using two Android devices. Naturally, I immediately downloaded it, made sure I reset the adb port command, and connected the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-a-mobile-gaming-beast-and-it-just-scored-its-first-major-discount-at-amazon">RedMagic 10 Pro</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>At first, it wasn't really quite as smooth as I would've hoped, with graphical glitches and delays making it practically unusable. However, I went over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/zwc456baby/ScrcpyForAndroid">GitHub landing page</a>, and there is a list of instructions. It turns out that I didn't set the resolution and bitrate to the correct figures. So after fixing those, I reconnected the two devices, and it's been working great ever since.</p><p>Apparently, ScrcpyForAndroid was first released in October 2024, and I'm surprised I had yet to come across it. Even still, this actually isn't the first time that I've used something similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> introduced a similar feature built into the device, making it possible to use your phone from the tablet. However, this is only possible if you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. Yet again, we have an awesome feature that's locked down by the manufacturer.</p><p>There are no such limitations here, as ScrcpyForAndroid doesn't care about what devices you're using. All that matters is that you have Wireless USB Debugging enabled on the phone before getting started.</p><p>That's not to say there aren't limitations, even when compared to the standard Scrcpy client app for Windows. For instance, you can drag and drop files between the two devices, but nothing happens. There wasn't an error message or anything; it just didn't work. Honestly, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as I'm just happy that this is even possible without needing to worry about having two devices from the same company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-1" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to RedMagic 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just for chuckles, I tried side-loading the APK on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. After again making sure the settings were right, I connected it to the phone and the RedMagic 10 Pro appeared like magic!</p><p>Then I got the wild idea to try and see if I could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> to show up on the Tab S10 Ultra's display. It's technically possible, provided that Developer Options are enabled, as you need to turn on Wireless Debugging. However, it doesn't quite work the same way as controlling a phone from a tablet or even a tablet from a Chromebook.</p><p>Instead of being able to see your entire screen, ScrcpyForAndroid only displays Android apps when used on a Chromebook. So, after you connect the Chromebook to your Android tablet, you'll only see the Settings app. A way around this is to open whatever Android app you want to use first and then start up the ScrcpyForAndroid connection. In reality, this probably isn't something that anyone would do, but hey, I at least wanted to give it a shot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-chromebook-plus" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear that people want to be able to access and use their phones while also using a computer. As I mentioned before, Phone Link and Link to Windows have been around for years, while Scrcpy has been around for even longer. Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-app-streaming">App Streaming via Phone Hub</a> with ChromeOS 115, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> and macOS Sequoia, Apple introduced iPhone Mirroring.</p><p>However, the overarching theme with all of these options is that you're limited in what devices are compatible or the features that are available. With Scrcpy, there are no such limitations, and it's just another reason why Android devices continue to prove to be more versatile than almost anything else.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini in Workspace is adding a Google Calendar side panel, starting out in Workspace Labs.</li><li>The test allows users to ask questions or create events using AI with Gemini.</li><li>You can sign up for Workspace Labs to try the feature, but there's no way to opt-out of Gemini in Google Calendar unless you leave Labs completely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been steadily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">adding Gemini side panels to Workspace apps</a> and web clients, and Google Calendar is the latest web client to get that treatment. First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-calendar-gemini-side-panel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the side panel is currently being tested in Calendar as part of Workspace Labs. Google explains the full functionality of Gemini in Google Calendar in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/15985129" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>The support document explains that Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> can help you check your schedule, create an event, or look up event details. Android Central was able to test the Gemini side panel in Google Calendar, which includes four suggestions for how you can use it:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ask:</strong> Check my schedule for next week</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a weekly run to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a lunch event to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create: </strong>Add commute blocks to my calendar</li></ul>
<p>The example suggestions provide an idea of how Google sees Gemini in Google Calendar helping users, and it sure seems like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can serve as an AI-based personal assistant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.39%;"><img id="4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA" name="Google-Workspace-Gemini-Side-Panel" alt="The Gemini side panel in Google Workspace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1778" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google explains that conversation history with Gemini in Calendar can easily be lost, including when you refresh your browser, close and reopen Calendar, or lose internet connection. Additionally, you can manually clear your conversation history by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting <strong>Clear history</strong>. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/duet-ai-coming-to-google-workspace-soon">Workspace Labs feature</a>, you might not always get a perfect response.</p><p>"Gemini for Google Workspace is constantly learning and may not be able to support your request," the company says in the support document. "If you get a suggestion that’s inaccurate or that you feel is unsafe, you can submit feedback. Your feedback can help improve AI-assisted Workspace features and broader Google efforts in AI."</p><p>The only way to disable this feature is to leave Workspace Labs, which is permanent. You'll lose all Workspace Labs features and won't be able to rejoin. You can sign up for Workspace Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/labs-sign-up/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>There has been a lot of chatter lately that Samsung could be skipping a couple of major software update steps and jumping straight to the next major software release.</p><p>It was just a couple of days ago that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">Iceuniverse took to X </a>with a bold claim stating the Korean OEM will likely be skipping the One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1 updates and instead will be bringing in a major One UI 8. This is a curious move where, even before officially releasing the much-delayed stable One UI 7 build for the majority of devices, it seems to be developing the new One UI 8.</p><p>Another leaker, Tarun Vats, seems to have spotted a new build in development indicating that the One UI 8 powered by Android 16 could likely be coming to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. He claims that the company started developing the software update two months earlier than usual and that he spotted it being internally tested on the Galaxy S25 series. The build version is as follows:</p><p><em>S938BXXU1BYC1/S938BOXM1BYC1/S938BXXU1BYC1</em></p>

<p>Samsung seems to be fast-tracking its next update in an attempt to keep up with Google's Android 16 rollout that is set to take place in June, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">confirmed by the tech giant during MWC.</a> Also because of the lack of time to develop smaller UI builds before the One UI 8 hits devices.</p><p>Historically, Samsung drops its major software updates closer to October every year. However, this time around, with the OneUI 7, it's a different story. There's no doubt that the One UI 7 rollout has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">continuously pushed out</a> since last year, and now its stable version is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">set to drop </a>on devices only in April.</p><p>However, if Samsung is testing out the One UI 8 two months early, we're keeping our hopes up that beta versions of the build could show up earlier in the Fall.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home Max users are losing the sound detection feature in May 2025.</li><li>The feature is available for Nest Aware subscribers, and will remain for other Home and Nest devices.</li><li>Sound detection made it possible to receive notifications when your Home Max hears dangerous sounds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the Home Max smart speaker back in 2017, and many are in use today. However, as the company recently communicated in an email to owners, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home-max">Google Home Max</a> is losing the sound detection feature (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-home-max-sound-detection/" target="_blank"> 9to5Google</a>). This feature used the Home Max microphone to listen for dangerous sounds, like glass breaking or a smoke alarm ringing, and sent a push notification to the user's smartphone.</p><p>It required a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-aware-vs-ring-protect">Nest Aware subscription</a>, but will be sunset for the Google Home Max on May 8, 2025. Google says that the feature will still be supported "on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription." It's unclear why the feature is being dropped specifically from the Home Max, although the speaker is getting old.</p><p>"Starting May 8, 2025, your Google Home Max will no longer have the sound detection feature as part of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-nest-aware-subscription-your-nest-camera">Nest Aware subscription</a>," the email reads. "Sound detection (which alerts you if glass breaking or a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm is heard) will still be supported on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription."</p><p>Sound detection is useful for making sure you don't miss important security events while you're away from home. A notification that glass broke or that a smoke or carbon monoxide detector went off could help homeowners respond to problems quickly. It's especially helpful for people deep into the Google Home/Nest ecosystems, as you can look into live camera feeds to respond to sound detection pings if you have them.</p><p>As of now, sound detection will still be available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and Google Home mini hardware. 9to5Google points out that the Google Home Max runs an older firmware version, number 1.56.275994, than those other two models, which run 3.75.456944. This major disparity could be a reason why sound detection is being dropped.</p><p>The Google Home Max was discontinued four years ago, but still receives updates.</p>

An X user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/moto-g64-android-15-update-india/">91mobiles</a>) has shared the screenshot of the changelog, which indicates that the latest firmware is bearing the <strong>V1TD35H.83-20-5</strong> version.

<p>Per the changelog, the Android 15 update to the Moto G64 should make the device faster and more secure, which further includes smoother graphics, and faster app performance, amongst others. This update to the Moto G64 also means users can experience the new Hello UI skin on top of Android 15, which is said to be replacing the My UX skin popular through Android 14.</p><p>As 91mobiles notes, the Moto G64 joins the Android 15 bandwagon just like the Moto Edge 50 Neo which started receiving the update in January. The update is also said to include the latest security patch and notable bug fixes. As Motorola just started rolling out the update this week, users can expect it on their devices in the coming weeks as it is likely a gradual roll-out.</p>

<p>In other news, Motorola is working on its next foldable, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, which recently made its way through leaks featuring a new Rio Red colorway. It is the next clamshell phone from the company, which is expected to debut sometime in April.

On the inside, the device is expected to have a 6.9-inch pOLED display alongside a 4-inch cover screen, and the chipset powering the handset is likely the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which already powers a significant amount of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> released this year.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly rolling out its One UI 7 beta program for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 in South Korea, India, and the U.S.</li><li>The devices are receiving the program ranging from 4GB to 5GB in download size as it packs many of the AI enhancements and changes the S24 received.</li><li>Samsung stated this week the programs would begin for its foldable; however, we're still waiting on the Galaxy S23 series and its tablets.</li><li>One UI 7's stable rollout is expected in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned earlier this week, Samsung's promised beta program start for its recent foldable duo is kicking off.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung is currently rolling out One UI 7 Beta 1 to the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The publication states the foldable (if enrolled in the program) will download/install version F741NKSU2ZYBJ. The program arrives with a payload size of 4GB for the clamshell. Curiously, the update was initially spotted arriving for South Korean users today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The program is expected to begin in other regions, as well, like the U.S., but it might take a little time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">clocked the arrival</a> of the program for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Unlike its clamshell duo, the Fold 6's program has supposedly arrived for U.S. users alongside India. The post states the versions are F956U1UEU2ZYBJ<strong> </strong>and F956BXXU2ZYBJ, respectively, at a 5GB download with the March 2025 security patch.</p>

<p>With Samsung doubling down heavily on Galaxy AI, it seems plausible that the huge download sizes for the Flip 6 and Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">include similar features</a> like the Galaxy S24. SamMobile was able to unearth the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-full-changelog/">patch notes</a> for the foldables, which include items like One UI 7's UI overhaul, the Now Bar, separated notification and Quick Panels, and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> is a pretty major addition to the Android 15-based software, letting users gain insights via live updates, access music controls, and routines. In a way, the Now Bar is an easy gateway into Samsung's other major feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. This is an AI-powered feature for upcoming events, weather, and more that arrived on the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>With the test underway, users should be able to gain One UI Beta Program access by heading into the Samsung Members app and signing up — once it lands in your respective region.</p><p>Galaxy users <em>without </em>a Galaxy S25 device have been waiting on One UI 7 for a while, and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently announced</a> it would arrive in April officially. Before that, the company teased the beta program coming to several other devices, like the Flip 6, Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series. Regarding the foldables, the Korean OEM said those respective programs would begin "this week" and it's seemingly making good on that promise.</p><p>For the others, the company's post didn't state when we could see them. However, those beta programs are expected to kick off randomly throughout March. There were also more hints that Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-ai-subscription-is-no-different-than-what-apple-and-google-are-already-doing">start charging</a> for its AI.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's advantage in the AI race is that it can integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into its existing products and services, and the company looks to be doing just that with new and upcoming features. First, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">AI Mode for Google Search</a>, which is our first look at how search engines will change thanks to AI. It turns out Google is also working on the reverse — using a user's Google Search history to personalize Gemini's AI responses. That's what Google will do with "Gemini Personalization model," as revealed by Android Authority.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-personalization-model-apk-3533029/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> discovered the unannounced model, which appears to be functional, in version 16.8.31 of the Google app beta. The beta adds a new model, listed as Gemini Personalization. This "experimental" model is described as offering "help based on your Search history." If you choose to connect your Google Search history to Gemini, you'll be able to get more personalized responses to your queries,</p><p>"This version of Gemini uses your Google Search history to give you personalized help," the prompt explains. "In order to use it, you'll need to first connect Gemini to your Search history. You can always disconnect it later."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1182px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.27%;"><img id="yyiTGAXV6bcWodDHM5EWFg" name="Gemini-Personalization-Explainer" alt="Gemini's personalization mode in a Google app beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyiTGAXV6bcWodDHM5EWFg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1182" height="866" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google notes that a user's search history will only be used to influence the Gemini Personalization model, and not any other models. Additionally, the company says that chats using the Personalize model won't be used to train and improve Gemini. It will be saved in Gemini Apps and Activity, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-remove-your-activity-from-gemini">will be deleted after 60 days</a>.</p><p>To use the Gemini Personalization model, you must turn on Web and App Activity in Gemini settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.92%;"><img id="L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg" name="Gemini-Personalization-Demo" alt="Gemini's personalization mode in a Google app beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="1294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Authority's initial tests found that Gemini Personalization was able to accurately call upon a user's Google Search history to respond to queries. Searches dating back to January 2025 were surfaced by Gemini Personalization. The model notes that "some Gemini features are not available in this version."</p><p>Being that the Personalization model is functional in the Google app beta, it's possible that this feature launches soon. It could start off as a Gemini Advanced feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium users</a> only. Google hasn't publicly announced this feature yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-132">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s AI Mode is replacing classic search results, starting with Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>AI Mode lets you ask layered questions, follow up, and dig deeper—all within Google Search.</li><li>A new 'AI Mode' button sits in the filter carousel on the left for quick activation.</li><li>On mobile, AI Mode has a dedicated button under the Search bar next to Google Lens and Sound Search.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s AI Mode, its ChatGPT-style search, is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">swapping out traditional results for a chatbot-style experience</a>, at least for paid users.</p><p>Signing up for the Search Labs waitlist is open to everyone, but paid subscribers are getting first dibs on access. If you’re in, you’ll get an email letting you know when it’s your turn to try it out.</p><p>This new feature takes searching up a notch, letting you dive deep with complex, layered questions and follow-up threads all right in Google Search.</p><p>Building on Google's AI Overview system, AI Mode uses a customized version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0</a> to tackle complex questions. With advanced reasoning, analysis, and multimodal capabilities, it's great for deep dives and cross-referencing information.</p><p>AI Mode is just a click away thanks to a new 'AI Mode' button in the filter carousel on the left side of any search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:116.38%;"><img id="5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB" name="Google-Search-AI-Mode" alt="AI Mode in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1856" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On mobile, AI Mode gets its own button right under the Search bar in the Home tab, alongside Google Lens and Sound Search.</p><p>A sleek visual upgrade is the text cursor, which cycles through Google's signature four colors, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-ai-mode-early-access/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This dynamic design, found on both Android and iOS, is paired with vibrant blue, red, yellow, and green animations, especially during voice input and search results.</p><p>One big change is how your search query now sits at the very top of the page, without the usual floating search bar. As for sources, mobile shows them in a carousel at the top and bottom of the screen, while desktop tucks them into a card on the right side.</p><p>Just like with any research, it’s smart to fact-check info from AI sources. AI is great for pulling things together quickly, but it’s not foolproof and can mess up facts or show bias.</p><p>Currently, AI Mode is pretty basic. While it handles text and voice input (on mobile), it only spits out text. However, Google promises future upgrades, including image and video responses, better formatting, and more direct links to relevant content.</p><p>AI Mode is rolling out first to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers. The plan comes with a free month to try it out, then costs $20 a month. Along with AI Mode, you get 2TB of storage and early access to upgraded Google AI tools.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13 was spotted receiving a new update early this morning in the U.S.</li><li>The update is roughly 1.3GB with camera improvements focused in the "tone" capabilities of the OnePlus 13's rear cameras.</li><li>There are rumors that OnePlus is developing a "mini" version of its latest flagship with a massive battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There appears to be an update slowly rolling out for the latest OnePlus flagship phone today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The update's appearance was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> earlier this morning. The patch is marked as version CPH2655_15.0.0.602(EX01) on the flagship with a 1.26GB download size. While the download is sizeable, OnePlus' patch notes don't highlight numerous changes.</p><p>The core of this OxygenOS patch concerns the camera system for the OnePlus 13. The company says it's rolling in a fix to "improve the focus capability of the rear cameras." Additionally, the update works to refine the "tone and color" capabilities when users take photos with the rear camera array.</p><p>Lastly, the changelog notes system "stability and performance" improvements, though it lacks to state what these are — which is pretty standard.</p><p>OnePlus adds the patch contains the February 2025 security patch with this download. It's worth mentioning that OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1805228920841175049">updated its thread</a> on its community forum regarding this update extremely early this morning.</p><p>The company drew attention to users in North America receiving this update. It's likely just beginning to make its rounds, so users should keep their eyes open for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the second time a OnePlus 13 patch has focused on the "tone" of photos with its rear cameras. An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-second-firmware-update-ai-fixes-detailed">update from January</a> not only tried to enhance the stability of its cameras, but also its "tone" capturing capabilities. That update at the beginning of the year came swiftly after the device's very first post-launch. OnePlus was fixing some lingering issues plaguing users while also delivering on some AI promises.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 received a face-to-face AI translation feature, which lets users see what another person is saying in split-view. The update brought the feature to "select" headphones, as well.</p><p>Early January held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-13-gets-gemini-nano-and-oneplus-13r-receives-new-updates">first post-launch update</a> with the inclusion of Google's Gemini Nano integration and generative AI in Messages.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-mini-large-battery-compact-phone-rumors">there are rumors</a> that OnePlus is working on a "13 Mini" with a 6,000mAh battery. Allegedly, the Chinese OEM will work to keep the device extremely thin even with such a huge battery capacity. It gets us thinking the phone could sport the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a> as the flagship 13 — if these rumors are true, of course.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to cost around the same price as the current Galaxy S25 Plus.</li><li>A leak also predicts that the upcoming ultra-thin flagship will weigh 162 grams.</li><li>A poll on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that customers might choose other Galaxy S25 models over the Galaxy S25 Edge at the same price.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's ultra-thin flagship, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, is expected to launch soon — perhaps as early as next month. While the company has shown off the design of the Galaxy S25 Edge, a lot of other details are unknown. However, we now have an idea of how much the Galaxy S25 Edge will cost and weigh, thanks to a leak from tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1897974549045821635?t=Ds2jpGnWAIx2s8DDJf2RXQ&s=19" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>Ice Universe says that the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will be "similar to that of S25 Plus." That aligns with what past rumors have stated, and suggests that Samsung's slim phone will cost around $1,000. The Galaxy S25 Plus retails for $1,000 for the 256GB variant, and that doesn't account for any trade-in deals or offers. Samsung is also still running a promotion that gives you the 512GB configuration, priced at $1,200, for the price of the base model.</p><p>With that in mind, it's likely that the Galaxy S25 Edge price is somewhere in between the base-model Galaxy S25 and the premium Galaxy S25 Plus. If the price is similar between these two phones, which one would you buy? That's what Ice Universe asked in a poll on X, and over 3,300 people voted at the time of publishing this article.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The weight of Galaxy S25 edge is confirmed, 162g, 5.84mm thick, and the price is similar to that of S25+. ​​​
If the price is similar, which would you choose, S25+ or S25 edge?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1897974549045821635">March 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The verdict? Fifty-three percent of people chose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, while just under 47% chose the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's a small sample size, but this poll suggests the Galaxy S25 Edge could be a niche offering — especially at its high price point.</p><p>The other specs of the Galaxy S25 Edge are impressive. The slim phone is rumored to weigh 162 grams and measure 5.84mm thick, according to the latest leaks. Previous rumors predicted that the Galaxy S25 Edge could be lighter, but those appear to be outdated now. Additionally, it will have two cameras, a 3,900mAh battery, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>With a release expected on April 16, we could be just weeks away for a full Galaxy S25 Edge reveal.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you don't mind going for an entry-level phone, and would appreciate an extra $25 off; you're looking for a phone with a decently sized AMOLED screen; having a smartphone with a large battery and/or a 25W charging speed is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance; you want a smartphone with more than 4GB of RAM.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Samsung launched the affordable Galaxy A16 5G in January</a>, and retailers are already offering early discounts on the smartphone.

<ul><li>Honor is seemingly preparing to launch its next foldable, the Honor Magic V4, around June 2025.</li><li>The Honor Magic V4 is tipped to get even thinner, with a thickness under 9mm when folded.</li><li>Honor's upcoming foldable is also expected to have an impressive camera system with a 200MP telephoto camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor could be gearing up to release its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">next foldable</a>, the Honor Magic V4, and the phone's specs have apparently leaked. Known leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5141223314293756" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> revealed many details about the device in a post, including its thickness, screen size, and camera sensors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_magic_v4_leaked_specs_are_insane_oppo_find_n5_to_get_a_true_competitor-news-66836.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Being that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> recently launched to critical acclaim, and is likely to compete directly with the Magic V4, the just-leaked specifications indicate that Honor might bring a real challenger to Oppo.</p><p>For starters, the Honor Magic V4 is tipped to measure less than 9mm when folded and bring an IPX8 water-resistance rating. That'll likely be just as thin as the Oppo Find N5, which measures 8.93mm when folded. However, the Find N5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">has an IPX9 rating</a>, and that's better than the rumored Magic V4's durability.</p><p>The leak also confirms that the Magic V4 will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, just like the regular Honor Magic 7 Pro and the Oppo Find N5. It's unclear whether it'll use the foldable version of the chip — the same seven-core variant that the Find N5 also uses — or the fully-featured version in the Magic 7 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-17.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 tent mode against table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldable phones have always come with camera compromises, but Honor might be trying to break that trend with the Magic V4. The main camera is said to be a 50MP lens with a 1/1.5-inch sensor size. Meanwhile, that's paired with a 200MP telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and 3x optical zoom support. We don't yet know if that could be paired with another camera, but since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> used a triple-camera setup, it's likely.</p><p>Finally, the report indicates that the Honor Magic V4 will be equipped with an 8-inch main screen and a 6.45-inch cover screen. Wireless charging and satellite connectivity will be available, too.</p><p>Current predictions expect the Honor Magic V4 to launch around June 2025, and leaks should come more frequently as that timeframe gets closer. It's possible that the Magic V4 launches in China before Europe, as is typically the case with Honor launches.</p>
