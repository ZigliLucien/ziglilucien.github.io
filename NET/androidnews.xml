The AI-powered chatbot can replace your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, have conversational chats with you in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, and even analyze your documents.

<p>There's only one way to change how Gemini sounds, and that's via the Gemini app. However, this setting changes a lot more than just the voice used in the app. It will also change the voice used for Gemini Live, the Gemini assistant, and all apps that integrate with Gemini. For example, if you tap <strong>Listen</strong> beside a written Gemini response, it'll speak using the voice you select in the Gemini app.</p><p>There are 10 voice options available: Vega, Ursa, Pegasus, Nova, Eclipse, Lyra, Orbit, Dipper, Capella, and Orion. You can pick one of those voices if your first language in Android is a supported language. Supported languages for Gemini voices are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Arabic</li><li>Bengali</li><li>Danish</li><li>Dutch</li><li>English</li><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Gujarati</li><li>Hindi</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Kannada</li><li>Latvian</li><li>Lithuanian</li><li>Malayalam</li><li>Marathi</li><li>Norwegian</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Romanian</li><li>Slovenian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swahili</li><li>Swedish</li><li>Tamil</li><li>Telugu</li><li>Turkish</li><li>Ukrainian</li><li>Urdu</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul>
<h2 id="how-to-change-a-voice-in-the-gemini-app-2">How to change a voice in the Gemini app</h2>
<p>It only takes a few taps to change the Gemini app's voice. You can listen to all the options before making your selection, and can always go back to change it later. Here's how to do it.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gemini app</strong> on your Android phone.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>Profile picture</strong> or <strong>initial</strong> in the top right corner of the app.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Gemini's voice</strong>.</p><p>4. Swipe left or right to <strong>hear a voice</strong>, and stop at the one you like.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>Back</strong> button to select a voice.</p>

<p>Now that Gemini is a significant part of Android, you may want to change its voice to match your own, or to simply find one you like the sound of. Voice assistants have had the ability to change voices for years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-voice-google-assistant-your-phone">including the Google Assistant</a>. So, it's natural for you to want to change Gemini to match your preferences, too.</p>

Thanks to this leftover Cyber Monday deal, that may not be a problem any longer. </p>

This GPS smartwatch harnesses the power of the sun to last up to 22 days in smartwatch mode, plus you get an ultra-durable titanium and reinforced polymer construction, built-in flashlight, and all of the health and fitness tracking features that made Garmin famous. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFC27W7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5574cd41-92c8-4508-834e-49c67d8d0263" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$899.99" data-dimension48="$899.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want great battery life and GPS in a super-durable Garmin watch; you missed the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales but still want to score some great savings. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>; you prefer a slimmer design in your wearables; you need a smartwatch with an AMOLED display.<strong> </strong></p><p>The Garmin Fenix 7 Pro remains a great choice if the recently released Fenix 8 is a bit too rich for your blood. Currently a whopping $450 cheaper than its newer sibling, the last-gen Fenix 7 Pro boasts almost all the same mapping, training guidance, and sports modes, plus you get the built-in flashlight, solar-powered battery, and a spacious MIP display. </p><p>Sure, if you have a little more cash to spend, consider upgrading to the Fenix 8 or maybe grab the Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) while it&apos;s on sale (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFC27W7"><strong>also 32% off at Amazon</strong></a>).

So it was fascinating to see that Apple had dethroned Garmin as the most popular running watch on the platform.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-releases-annual-year-in-sport-trend">2024 report</a>, the Apple Watch Series and Apple Watch SE were the number one and two gear for all runners, followed by the Garmin Forerunner 245. Last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watch-from-2015-most-popular-on-strava">8-year-old Garmin Forerunner 235 was the most popular</a> worldwide for runners, while the Forerunner 245 was the most-used watch in the U.S.</p><p>This year's report solely showed global data, but Apple Watches are very popular in the U.S., so they likely would have won regardless. Garmin still dominated with its acclaimed Edge 530 and 830 bike computers, with the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt V1 — the top 2023 bike computer in the U.S. — coming in third.</p><p>Outside of gear, the report showed a major increase in running clubs and group runs of 10+, with women in particular joining Strava clubs 89% more in 2024 than in 2023.</p><p>The Strava Year in Sport 2024 report showed that runners' median activity pace was 10:15 per mile; the 2023 report showed lower median numbers for most generations aside from Boomers, so either people slowed down globally in 2024 or older runners skewed the median.</p><p>For other activities, the median pace or speed was 12.1mph for cyclists, 19:40 min/mile for walkers, and 22:06 min/mile for hikers. Now we know what pace to beat to be "better than average."</p><p>Interestingly, Strava says that 72% of uploaded activities come from the mobile app. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> are the overwhelming favorite for marathoners and half marathoners, one in four 5K runners use their phones, perhaps using an external HRM like the Polar H10 or else ignoring heart rate and other wrist-based data entirely.</p>
<h2 id="why-apple-suddenly-beat-garmin-for-runners-worldwide-2">Why Apple suddenly beat Garmin for runners worldwide</h2>
<p>As someone who covers running watches extensively, I believe there are a few reasons why Apple suddenly dominated the Strava gear category for runners.</p><p>The first is about simple categorization and raw sales: Apple consistently sells about 20% of all wearables worldwide (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/wearablevendor">IDC</a>), and all Apple "Series" watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series 9</a> or Series X are categorized as the same "Apple Watch" on Strava, which lets years of different Apple Watch generations tag-team to take the top slot. The same goes for the two generations of Apple SEs.</p><p>(As much as I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">loved the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> for its accuracy and ultra-bright, massive squircle display, I don't think it's counted in the same category.)</p><p>Garmin watches all log activities as their own distinct devices, and we've seen five new Garmin Forerunner watches in the last couple of years. Forerunners have excellent longevity — hence why the 2015 Forerunner 235 and 2019 Forerunner 245 kept their Strava crowns for so long — but I suspect many of these loyal Garmin fans gave in and upgraded to the Forerunner 165, 255, 265, 955, or 965 in recent years — or tried <em>other</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> brands like the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>So it's likely that Garmin's share of Strava runners hasn't faded below Apple, but rather that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>'s training load tools or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>'s budget-priced perks tempted 235 and 245 users to swap, and each watch is claiming a distinct portion of the Strava user base.</p>

<p>Still, Apple has to receive at least some credit for this newfound Strava dominance, because it has seriously emphasized improving its running software over the last few generations.</p><p>It started with watchOS 9 in 2022, when Apple let runners see heart rate zones, running power, cadence, or elevation during a workout; race their past route times; and receive accurate track data using an Apple Maps database of public tracks. Garmin already had all this and more, but Apple closed the gap.</p><p>Most recently with watchOS 11, Apple added 7-day and 28-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> insights in graph form, showing if you're overtraining or slacking off compared to your past efforts, so you get fitter without straining too hard and hurting yourself. You can't see specific training load numbers or aerobic/anaerobic breakdowns like Garmin offers, but it's a streamlined metric for new-ish runners.</p><p>Even if "serious runners" tend to use Garmin watches with better battery life, Apple is cornering the market on casual couch-to-5K runners trying to get fit and lose weight. Strava itself said in the press release that "5k runners tended to opt for an Apple Watch, while the Garmin Forerunner was more popular for longer distances."</p><p>Basically, Apple is democratizing running insights, making them available for people who aren't sure if they're ready to commit to a specialized fitness watch. So even though I use Garmin watches most frequently, I think Apple swooping in to claim the top Strava crown is an awesome development, because it means more types of people are falling in love with running (or at least fighting through the anguish to get fit).</p><p>The same likely applies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> owners now that Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">makes running more of a priority</a> — even if they have much smaller Strava numbers than Apple Watch owners.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung might finally glimpse the long-rumored smart glasses at the Galaxy S25 series launch.</li><li>It will likely be a sneak peek of the company’s first AR glasses in mid-January.</li><li>The smart glasses will reportedly be based on Samsung’s Extended Reality (XR) platform.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might be prepping for its Galaxy S25 series launch, which is anticipated to happen in January 2025. While the trio of handsets are expected, a new report reveals that the company might have a smart glasses launch up its sleeve next month.</p><p>According to the Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241202129000017">Yonhapnews</a>, spotted by tipster Jukanlosreve on X, has indicated that Samsung might be showcasing a sneak peek of its first augmented reality (AR) glasses at the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series Unpacked Event. It could be some sort of short video or an image reveal — likely a similar approach from the company where it showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> for the first time during its 2024 Unpacked Event.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just in: Samsung is set to unveil a prototype of its augmented reality (AR) glasses, currently in development, during the Galaxy S25 Unpacked event early next year, likely in the form of videos or images.Additionally, prior to revealing the prototype, Samsung plans to introduce…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1863739719248646330">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The upcoming smart glasses will likely rival the Meta’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban</a> glasses. They will be built on Samsung’s Extended Reality (XR) platform, which is also tipped to be demoed at the upcoming Unpacked event. The Korean outlet further shares that the smart glasses will likely weigh 50 grams, coupled with the ability to make payments with the help of AI, gesture, and face recognition features.</p><p>While we might see a glimpse of the first smart glasses at the Unpacked event, which may include a prototype, the product is expected to be released sometime in the third quarter of 2025, notes the Korean publication. It is still unclear whether the alleged smart glasses are the ones that were rumored to be co-developed by Google and Qualcomm.</p>
<p>It’s also been a while since we heard about Samsung's smart glasses, which were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">trademarked</a> at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. last year. The product was then trademarked under the “Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses” categories.</p><p>Meanwhile, an alleged prototype was spotted before the launch of Apple Vision Pro. It included micro OLED displays powered by the Exynos 2200 chip and other highlighting features like eye-tracking cameras. However, it was soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-samsung-xr-prototype-used-exynos-chip">scrapped</a> after the Vision Pro’s launch.</p><p>Regardless, it is still encouraging to see Samsung still working on its version of smart glasses, which will likely be witnessed first at the Unpacked Event in 2025, which otherwise headlines the much-awaited Galaxy S25 series.</p>

<ul><li>A report notes the OnePlus Watch 3 has appeared in the FCC database for its certification.</li><li>The highlights include a larger 631mAh battery over its predecessor and a slightly thinner frame.</li><li>The OnePlus Watch 3 was previously rumored to arrive "soon" in a global launch alongside the OEM's two smartphones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>More information is bubbling up about the next OnePlus smartwatch, but this time it's spotted within a government database.</p><p>As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/possible-oneplus-watch-3-fcc-launch/">91Mobiles</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/spesifikasi-oneplus-watch-3-mengemuka-di-fcc-ukuran-sama-tapi-baterai-lebih-besar/">Indonesian version</a> of the website discovered the OnePlus Watch 3 passing through the FCC database for certification. It seems that the watch possesses model number OPWWE251. The publication dove into the available specs, which state the device will feature a 631mAh battery.</p><p>What's more, the database listing provided by OnePlus says the watch will have the following measurements: 46.6 X 47.6 X 11.75mm.</p><p>A standout in this listing, as noted by the publication, is a potential indication of an imminent launch. The English post spotted OnePlus' EUT information, which states the product it's describing is a "production unit," not a prototype.</p><p>With that, speculation suggests the Chinese OEM is closer to the launch of the Watch 3, which echoes what we've heard previously from tipsters.</p>

<p>More concrete specs about the Watch 3 weren't spotted; however, the listing details its Bluetooth and several Wi-Fi frequency capabilities. The device is also expected to debut with GNSS and NFC support.</p><p>The OnePlus FCC files indicate its Watch 3 could feature some notable changes over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">its predecessor</a>. For one, the Watch 2 offers a 500mAh battery with a 7.5W VOOC charger. The listing suggests a 131mAh upgrade, meaning users should get a little more life out of the device before resting it. Additionally, its measurements seemingly purport a slightly thinner watch. The rest of its body should remain roughly the same size, but we'll need its launch to know for sure.</p><p>We're unsure about its charging strength, but there was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-oneplus-watch-certification-specs-rendering">previous listing</a> that claimed it might see 10W.</p><p>With the FCC listing suggesting a close launch, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">echoes rumors from late November</a> that claimed OnePlus could drop the Watch 3 globally with its smartphones "soon." There's a chance we could see these devices appear in January, but it's anyone's guess right now.</p><p>For now, we'll have to wait. There are quite a few areas we hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">OnePlus Watch 3 can fix</a> that its predecessor fell short on, though.</p>

The device is believed to be accompanied by a sibling, OnePlus 13R, the specifications of which have now surfaced online.</p><p>Tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer, widely known as OnLeaks, has partnered with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-oneplus-13r-full-spec-sheet/">91mobiles</a> to share the specifications of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>’s successor for 2025. Like the predecessor, the OnePlus 13R will also carry the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate screen, and the tipster notes that improvements to the display can be seen in terms of peak brightness.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Today, I have the very complete specs sheet of the upcoming #OnePlus13R to share with you!😏This one comes on behalf of @91mobiles 👉🏻 https://t.co/7nR9Z4fbZi pic.twitter.com/MHB4z72dSS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1863917082804355385">December 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Underneath, the device is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the flagship SoC that powers all major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. This approach is similar to that of the OnePlus 12R, which was equipped with last year’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC.</p><p>The battery capacity is also likely to remain the same as the previous iteration; however, the charging speeds appear to take a slight hit as the OnePlus 13R is likely to support 80W fast charging instead of 100W.</p><p>The device is further tipped to include at least 12GB of RAM, 256GB of onboard storage, and a triple camera system, which may now have two 50MP sensors and an 8MP camera. For selfies, the device will rely on a 16MP sensor. The device should ship with Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">OxygenOS 15</a> out of the box.</p>
<p>The other parameters will include Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and an in-display fingerprint sensor. A new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, like the one seen on the OnePlus 13 China variant, would have been a great addition instead of the good old optical sensor.</p><p>Overall, the device is expected to be shorter, lighter, and thinner than the OnePlus 12R, with an expected 161.72 x 75.77 x 8.02mm size.</p><p>Meanwhile, OnePlus is gearing up for the OnePlus Ace 5 launch in China, which will most likely be dubbed the OnePlus 13R for the global markets. We might get more details about the latter when we see the Ace 5’s launch in China.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following a major launch, Starlink states its Direct-to-Cell is ready for more than just consumers.</p><p>SpaceX showcased the Falcon 9 launch of 20 satellites into orbit on December 4 via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1864506448174305477">an X broadcast</a>. Shortly after, the company's senior director of satellite engineering, Ben Longmier spoke about the launch in greater depth. According to Longmier, SpaceX sent "24 planes of 13 sats per plane" into space for its Direct-to-Cell service.</p><p>After the planes are raised to 360km, Longmier states the service will be ready for consumer use. However, they add that Starlink's Direct-to-Cell is "open for business for any teleco in the world."</p><p>The post highlights the service's ability to "eliminate" dead zones for users who are still looking to text or call others when out of cellular range.</p>

<p>Longmier reiterates T-Mobile's involvement with its satellite answer to dead zones. It seems that things will get underway soon as the post states direct-to-cell service will begin with T-Mobile in the U.S. "soon."</p><p>Starlink and T-Mobile started down this journey in 2022 when both companies announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-spacex-starlink-coverage-above-beyond">a joint partnership</a> to end dead zones. The purpose is to bring satellite connectivity capabilities to devices under T-Mobile cellular service program. Users, when out of tower range, would fall back on Starlink's satellites to continue talking or texting and contacting emergency services if required.</p><p>Both companies have been working toward this goal for two years and, at the end of November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/fcc-approves-t-mobile-and-starlinks-direct-to-cell-service">the FCC signed off on the project</a>. As a first for the industry, the FCC stated the idea of bringing satellite service in this way to consumers carries "critical public interest benefits." Similar to what Ben Longmier said following the recent satellite launch, a beta program is expected to begin in the U.S. shortly.</p><p>Additionally, it seems that SpaceX is awaiting approval for more specifications such as a "boost" in radio emission power to assist "more demanding use cases" for satellite connectivity. However, there is worry, namely from AT&T and Verizon, that such a power boost could interfere with their cellular networks.</p>

<p>Google is retroactively providing an extra two years of full OS upgrades to the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold, it quietly detailed in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705" target="_blank">updated support document</a>. Additionally, the company says that during this extended window, these models "may" also get new features through Pixel Drops.</p><p>The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nail_Sadykov" target="_blank">Nail Sadykov on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1864731533245845712?" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a>). It confirms what was originally suspected when Google released the first developer preview for Android 16 last month: the company plans to support the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, and Pixel Fold beyond its initial promises. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a> update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-supports-the-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-heres-why-it-matters">supported the Pixel 6, Pixel 6a, and Pixel 6 Pro</a>, even though Android 15 should be its last OS upgrade according to Google's three-year promise.</p><p>Now, the entire Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series — plus the original Pixel Fold — will get a total of five years of OS upgrades from the time they were first released. That's two more years than Google initially promised, as its first guarantee was that each of these models would get three years of OS upgrades and five years of security update.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google officially confirms the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold will get an additional 2 years of OS updates!

<p>The change means that the Pixel 6, Pixel 6a, and Pixel 6 Pro should receive Android 16 and Android 17.

The studio's seminal work, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, was a masterpiece that was simply unexpected in the VR space back in 2020 when it released. While the Chapter 2 follow-up to that game was very buggy at launch, it went on to get fixed and become one of the best Meta Quest games you can buy.</p>

<p>Now, the studio's third big title, Skydance's Behemoth, is stomping across VR headsets across the globe with its long-awaited December 5 release and I can confidently say this one lives up to the Skydance Interactive pedigree. I had previously tried the game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">back in June</a> on a PSVR 2 and wondered how it would translate to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. Thankfully, it's even better than I expected.</p><p>In fact, based on early impressions of the final game, the Meta Quest version is <strong>the</strong> version to get as it's the most polished, best-running version of the game. Skydance Interactive says it'll be patching the PSVR 2 version today and the PC release just hit virtual Steam shelves today, too. Regardless of the platform you play on, my experience with the game so far has been nothing short of brilliant.</p>

<p>Behemoth isn't nearly as expansive of a game as either of the Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners titles. That's not a problem by any means — especially not in a year when we got Batman Arkham Shadow, Metro Awakening, and literally dozens of other games worth playing in the span of the last two months — but it's worth noting that Skydance Interactive didn't go for the same scale with this game's length.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Nothing in the VR space comes close to matching the scale of the giants — not even Attack on Titan.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Instead, the studio aimed for the moon with the scale of objects that's only possible in VR. Fighting a Behemoth is a lot like the PS2 classic Shadow of the Colossus, but while watching a character climb such a beast on a TV is cool enough, it's an entirely different feeling when you are the one doing the climbing and the stabbing.</p><p>Behemoth certainly borrows enough traits from SotC while fighting, ahem, Behemoths, including stabbing weak points and climbing specific sections of each beast. There aren’t nearly as many of them as I had hoped — just four in total — but maybe we’ll get a DLC or sequel with even more if this game does as well as Saints & Sinners did.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yb5FRFFFCEKu4oBjfiEnH" name="skydance-behemoth-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot from Skydance's BEHEMOTH" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yb5FRFFFCEKu4oBjfiEnH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Interactive)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing in the VR space comes close to matching the scale of the giants — not even Attack on Titan, which finally hits version 1.0 on December 17. Standing under a Behemoth as it tries to stomp you to death is uniquely harrowing, especially since you can't fly through the air and easily dispatch them. You certainly have superhuman powers, but there's a limit to them.</p><p>Combat is simply wonderful and feels like the proper evolution of what we got in The Walking Dead S&S. That makes sense since some of the enemies are just slightly more intelligent zombies, affected by the rot that's also consuming your character in the story.</p><p>Like Saints & Sinners, combat is entirely open-ended but relies much more on blocking and parrying since your opponents aren't just zombies. They have weapons and skills, and many of them have armor that prevents your weapons from one-shotting them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZHQszeqcmgKqHnTeCZxGH" name="skydance-behemoth-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot from Skydance's BEHEMOTH" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHQszeqcmgKqHnTeCZxGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Interactive)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most areas have some sort of environmental traps that can be used to more creatively dispatch enemies.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To get around this, you've got a superhuman power that can be enabled every 20 seconds or so, allowing you to overwhelm many different types of enemies. While this <em>sounds </em>overpowered, it's not since the largest enemies cannot be grabbed and thrown. In fact, ranged enemies often picked me off while I was worried about a warhammer-wielding foe bashing in my skull, forcing me to rethink my tactics on the next respawn.</p><p>Most areas have some sort of environmental traps that can be used to more creatively dispatch enemies, too. Grabbing an enemy and throwing them against a spike wall is incredibly satisfying, and while some of the physics for pulling down trees or rock traps sometimes look funny, they're no less satisfying to use.</p><p>There's no durability system for weapons so when you find a weapon you like, you can keep it for the foreseeable future. Eventually, most weapons get replaced with a story-centric one that you can't get rid of — one sword, one axe, and one bow — but can be upgraded with shards you find throughout the game.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Grappling and repelling up and down cliffs and between grapple points feels fantastic, and the sense of vertigo I got when launching myself out and over a chasm was incredibly exciting in a way most games simply don't nail.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Skydance Interactive also seems to have addressed some of the things that I found funky in the hands-on a few months ago. Grabbing a rope to pull it now feels accurate each time, whereas I regularly dropped the rope during the hands-on — maybe I should call it a hands-off, then.</p><p>Grappling and repelling up and down cliffs and between grapple points feels fantastic, and the sense of vertigo I got when launching myself out and over a chasm was incredibly exciting in a way most games simply don't nail.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-giant.jpg" alt="Approaching a giant in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also noticed that the first Behemoth no longer "skates" on the ice as it did in the hands-on. This wasn't the type of ice skating that you think, it was more a pathfinding issue where the legs would slide unnaturally as the Behemoth turned around.</p><p>It's these little things — plus some incredible voice acting and memorable characters that you meet along the way — that really got me immersed into the world in the first few seconds. There's no long intro or nonsense to slink through. You're immediately thrown into a blizzard and expected to find safety.</p><p>It's brilliant, and I'm so happy Skydance is back with another must-have VR game, especially when expectations of the studio's latest work were sky high.</p>
