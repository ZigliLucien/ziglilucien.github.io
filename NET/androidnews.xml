And as you might expect, this last-minute update has been causing problems since then.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>, both released in 2024 running Wear OS 4, were originally supposed to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> between July and September 2025; only after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-missing-wear-os-5-update-3606156/">Android Authority</a> asked about the delay in October did the company say the update would arrive "in the near future."</p><p>Now, <em>some</em> OnePlus Watch owners have received the update, though not everyone; my U.S.-based OnePlus Watch 2R, for example, still shows Wear OS 4 and the May 2025 security update. But this might be a blessing in disguise, given the update's effect.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nZiXpT7tg2oRywSpkeECbb" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-battery.jpeg" alt="The battery life summary on the OnePlus Watch 2R.

The Watch 2 and 2R regularly lasted about three days in smart mode before the update; now, some users say it won't last a full day, even after trying factory resets and other fixes.</p><p>"I'm utterly heartbroken and frustrated with the drastic battery drain issue plaguing my OnePlus Watch 2 following the Wear OS 5 update," says one user. "My OnePlus Watch 2 now plummets from full charge at 1:00 PM to a critical 10% by 11:00 PM on light usage."</p><p>"Earlier I used to get 2.5 days easily with most settings on (at least 2 days)... Now barely getting 1 day," says another user. Someone responded that his drain wasn't quite as bad, but that he'd gone from 3–4 days before to "a strict 2 days" now.</p><p>Several users point to specific apps causing the drain, like the Weather app, Play Store, or "Wear OS" itself, but the variety suggests this is a system-wide issue rather than one app causing problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH" name="oneplus-watch-3-wear-os-logo" alt="Holding a black OnePlus Watch 3 with the Wear OS logo on its display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes this update especially frustrating to users is that stock Wear OS 5 is (A) a very subtle update with few notable changes and (B) supposed to make Wear OS<em> </em>run <em>more</em> efficiently, as it did on Pixel and Galaxy Watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> has run this version since April with no issues, making this unoptimized update on last-gen models disappointing to see.</p><p>Any brand can push a buggy update, but two weeks later, I'd have expected OnePlus to either roll it back or announce a timetable for fixes. Instead, OnePlus hasn't made any official announcement, from what we've seen. My colleague reached out to OnePlus about the update a few days ago, but we've yet to hear back.</p><p>Having recommended the OnePlus Watch 2R as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-budget-option">best budget Android smartwatch pick</a>, mostly on the strength of its battery life, this update is deeply concerning to me. OnePlus needs to prove that its promise of two Wear OS updates and three years of security updates isn't just empty rhetoric, and that it'll properly support these watches.</p><p>As it is, it's notable that the recent OnePlus Watch Lite skipped Wear OS entirely, using a proprietary RTOS like the original OnePlus Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Your transaction history page in Wallet for mobile devices is tipped to receive an upgrade. The publication spotted the company referencing the change, which says users will find transactions from "other devices and online purchases that use virtual card numbers."</p><p>With how this is described, there are expectations that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> on Android will bring total transaction tracking, similar to its web view. If the update arrives as speculation says, then users wouldn't need to open Chrome or hop into their bank account to see the full scope of their past purchases.</p><p>The post also notes that the inclusion of "other devices" in this updated transactions page should bring items purchased using your Wear OS device, too. On the other hand, the dive into a recent Play Services update surfaced a "search" function for transactions.</p><p>This is another feature that Google Wallet on the web offers. Its uses extend to searching your transactions by amount, merchant, or date.</p><p>While these changes were spotted in a recent Play Services update version, nothing has rolled out yet, and there's no clear indication as to when it will.</p><h2 id="digital-payments-shouldn-t-be-hard-2">Digital payments shouldn't be hard</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we await this transactions page update, Google Wallet gifted users an update in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallets-new-feature-saves-android-users-from-fumbling-for-passes">mid-December for passes</a>. The app uses some location-based magic, surfacing any stored digital passes on your lock screen as you approach certain places. Classified as a "context-aware" feature, Google Wallet's update finally brings this function to users after teasing it during its I/O conference.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you're rolling up to an airport gate or hopping into your favorite store, Google Wallet will recognize this and have your pass ready to go. Essentially, you won't have to go through the typical runaround.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-making-it-easier-to-catch-your-plane-or-train-on-android">update arrived late last year</a>, which made it easier to catch your plane or train. The app now utilizes Android 16's Live Updates to find important details regarding when their transport will be arriving on their lock and home screens. The OS' Live Updates were previously introduced for ride-shares and food deliveries, but have since started to expand to more crucial aspects.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what stands out in this leak is that the publication <em>and </em>the tipster allege a launch window in February. Quandt's BlueSky posts claims that Google is preparing to launch the mid-range model in "mid-February."</p><p>DroidLife highlighted its own research, and it supposedly discovered retail listings that have posted "similar details." The publication took it a step further, stating that the Pixel 10a could see a specific launch date of February 17, 2026 (that's a Tuesday, in case you're wondering).</p><p>Quandt's post continues with some last-minute device details, suggesting the phone will debut with 128GB and 256GB storage options. Consumers can pretty much expect these totals to remain low, as has been Google's previous trend. The tipster then highlights colors, such as Obsidian, Fog, Lavender, and Berry.</p><h2 id="a-mid-range-10a-2">A mid-range 10a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as colors go, there was an earlier leak last year that kinda-sorta mentioned how "bold" they'd be, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-may-launch-much-earlier-withpretty-bold-colors">was based on its supposed wallpapers</a>. A leak from Telegram claimed the Pixel 10a would debut in shades of black, blue, dark blue, red, and green. The "red" could probably be paired with "Berry," while "black" is most likely "Obsidian," now. In other news, there was a huge Pixel 10a leak before the year's end in December, speculating on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/more-pixel-10a-leaks-suggest-specs-close-to-googles-last-mid-range">a device that's not too different</a> from the 9a.</p><p>After a report spotted the phone receiving certification on Verizon's network, specifications highlighted a ~6.3-inch display, a 5,100mAh battery, and an 8/128GB  (RAM/storage) configuration. Moreover, a 48MP main camera was spotted, too.</p><p>The screen is said to be an FHD Plus display, which rounds out specs that make the 10a feel like a 9a. There's hope that the mid-range will be upgraded in other ways, like its Tensor G4, but there's nothing for certain yet. Additionally, it was previously theorized that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-surfaces-in-a-new-leak-with-a-nearly-identical-to-pixel-9a">phone could debut in March 2026</a>. While the current leaks go against that, it's still early.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone retails for the same $299.99 price tag of its predecessor, but it now comes with strong display protection, the latest Android version, a higher resolution selfie camera, and a larger battery. All of these upgrades should help position it as the ultimate lower mid-range offering. However, Samsung already has a strong contender at this price point with the Galaxy A26.</p><p>Launched in March 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Samsung Galaxy A26</a> has some distinct advantages over the Moto G Power 2026, like more years of OS upgrades, better display tech, and even a lower price after discounts. Choosing between the Moto G Power 2026 vs. Galaxy A26 is not going to be easy, but there are some stark differences which might make one a stronger choice over the other.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-design-and-display-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has the same design and dimensions as its predecessor. It's not as slim or compact as the Galaxy A26, but it does have superior certifications for toughness. There's an IP68/IP69 rating for the ultimate water ingress protection. You even get MIL-STD-810H certification, which ensures the phone can survive harsh drops and temperatures. The new colors look very nice, too.</p><p>The display of the Moto G Power isn't as impressive on paper compared to Samsung, but it's not bad either. You get a larger 6.8-inch Full-HD+ IPS LCD display with up to 1,000 nits of brightness. The refresh rate is also 120Hz. which has now become sort of a standard for most Android phones. Motorola has improved the shatter protection on the G Power with Gorilla Glass 7i, but this is still not as good as the Victus+ glass on the Galaxy. One good thing is that G Power has a textured TPU back panel, so there's little to no risk of shattering when dropped.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa" name="Samsung Galaxy A26 all colors" alt="All colors of the Samsung Galaxy A26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung really stepped up its game with the Galaxy A26's design. It still has that unmistakable budget look due to the waterdrop display notch and thick bezels at the bottom of the screen, but it gets an IP67 rating now, which wasn't there on the A25. It's slimmer and lighter than the Moto G Power, and you get Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the front and back of the phone. This should give the A26 a more premium in-hand feel, but all the glass on the back is still prone to damage if you're not careful.</p><p>Samsung has started using Super AMOLED screens for most of its phones now, and the Galaxy A26 gets a 6.7-inch panel with a crisp resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Colors and black levels should be richer and deeper compared to the IPS panel on the Motorola.</p><p>One thing that Samsung has removed, though, is stereo speakers. It's a bizarre move considering the A25 had it. I guess you win some, you lose some.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-hardware-specs-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 features the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC, which is the exact same one used in the older model, too. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025 review</a> should give you a fair idea of what to expect in terms of performance from the 2026 model. The chip is alright for the most part and even handles games fairly well, provided you tone down the quality settings of heavier titles.</p><p>Once again, there's only one variant of the 2026 Moto G Power out there with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The latter is expandable via a dedicated microSD card slot. The phone also features a headphone jack, stereo speakers, and FM radio — features that are absent in the Galaxy A26.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has a slightly larger battery than the Galaxy should help it last longer per charge, at least on paper. You get 30W wired charging but no wireless charging, which is something the 2025 variant had.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Moto G Power 2026</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A26</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Hello UX), up to 2 OS upgrades</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (One UI), up to 6 OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Pure Cashmere, Pantone Evening Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mint, Peach Pink</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,388 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, IPS LCD</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, Super AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6300</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 1380</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>6GB/ 8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main with Quad Pixel technology, <br>8MP ultra-wide, macro vision lens, <br>32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide,<br>2MP macro, <br>13MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Hi-Res Audio, Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Mono speaker</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>166. 62 x 77.1 x 8.72 mm</p></td><td  ><p>164 x 77.5 x 7.7 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>208 grams</p></td><td  ><p>200 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the U.S., the Samsung Galaxy A26 officially comes in just one variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage for $299. However, you can find unlocked international variants on Amazon with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage for under $250. This makes the Galaxy much better value for money if you plan on picking up the global variant.</p><p>Most of the models sold in the U.S. and globally feature the Exynos 1380 SoC, which is more potent than the MediaTek chip in the Moto, at least on paper. I'm not sure to what extent the 6GB RAM variant would cripple performance, but ideally, get the one with more RAM if you can. Even though performance should be better than the Moto G Power, remember that this is still a budget offering, so limit your expectations accordingly.</p><p>Samsung has given the Galaxy A26 a 5,000mAh battery, which should give it solid one and a half to two days of runtime, just like the Moto. The maximum charging speed is 25W, which is a bit slower than what Motorola offers.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-software-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4" name="moto-g-power-2026-evening-blue-hero" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in an evening blue color beside a coffee." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2025 was promised two OS upgrades and three years of security updates, and we assume the same holds true for the 2026 model as well.

While there aren't really any homegrown AI features, you do get some of them from Google, like Circle to Search.</p><p>Samsung, on the other hand, offers six OS generation upgrades for the Galaxy A26, which is incredible and the highest we've seen for a phone at this price.

The Moto G Power 2026 and Samsung Galaxy A26 feature 50MP main cameras with the same f/1.8 aperture and optical stabilization.

The two OS upgrade commitment is something that's hard to overlook, especially if you plan to use it for longer.

If you gloss over the mono speaker issue and the (still respectable) IP67 rating, the global variants are cheaper than the Moto, you get an AMOLED screen, a more premium glass design, and six OS upgrades, which is unheard of for a phone at this price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The toughest around</strong></em></p><p>The 2026 Moto G Power has the same toughness as the 2025 model but with a larger battery and a better selfie camera.

Reality Labs has been responsible for AR, VR, AI, and robotics development since its creation in 2020 and has historically spent billions on R&D each quarter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">Earlier reports</a> suggested that Meta was "trimming the fat" in the VR hardware research, OS development, and Horizon Worlds gaming social network development. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/2011132640536002799?s=20">new information</a> suggests that the cuts are far deeper than we expected.</p><p>Meta is reportedly closing most of its first-party game development studios, including the houses responsible for respected VR games like Deadpool VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, Supernatural, and Resident Evil 4 VR. The studios rumored to be closing are Armature Studios, Sanzaru Games, Twisted Pixel, and Within. LinkedIn profiles confirm job cuts at all of these studios, but</p><p>Meta is said to be keeping Beat Games, BigBox VR, Camouflaj, and Ouro open. These studios are responsible for the development of Beat Saber, Population: One, Batman Arkham Shadow, and Horizon Worlds, respectively. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games/">UploadVR</a> says it has independently confirmed the studio closures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.32%;"><img id="w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN" name="reality-labs-phoenix-mock-up-luna" alt="A mock-up of Reality Labs' Phoenix ultralight VR headset prototype made by Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2634" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Lunayian on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta for comment, but didn't receive a response in time for publishing. If true, this news would be a massive blow for the VR community and a huge hit to VR game development.</p><p>To date, Meta has closed several of its first-party studios over the years. We reported exclusively on the closing of Echo VR's studio back in August 2024, and Meta closed Unit 2 and Downpour Interactive in 2025. These cuts come after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">a 30% cut to the division</a> in early December 2025, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-is-outselling-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-and-every-other-game-console/">outselling the Nintendo Switch 2 and other consoles on Amazon</a> during the Christmas holiday period.</p><p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth is expected to hold a company-wide in-person meeting on January 14, 2026, to discuss changes being made at Reality Labs. The company is believed to be shifting more resources to AI and smart glasses products in place of its historical commitment to VR development. We still expect Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025">to debut a new product</a> early in 2027 that's a hybrid of smart glasses and a traditional VR headset, currently known as Project Phoenix, pictured above in a mock-up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's a shame, really, because the Razr Plus is a standout device in its own right, boasting a durable clamshell design, two gorgeous pOLED displays, and reliable performance that could easily hold its own against Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Z Flip 7</a>. </p><p>The Razr Plus (2025) is also just a joy to hold and use, with a solid metal frame, Pantone-certified color variant, and luxurious vegan leather finish. The battery life and camera quality are also solid, and while four years of software updates feels limited against the competition, the Snapdragon chipset and 12GB of RAM ensure that the clamshell device will be sufficiently powerful for years to come. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7" name="motorola-razr-plus-2025-cover-screen-01" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a fancy plate with its cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B3mn9bipkoL5uzHYU22Hb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned above, the catch is that you'll need to sign up for T-Mobile's Experience More or Experience Beyond plan to get the free phone. Both of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">data plans</a> give you unlimited talk, text, and premium data on T-Mobile's unmatched 5G network, plus a high-speed mobile hotspot, international coverage, and a few entertainment perks you might not expect, such as subscriptions to Netflix and Apple TV.</p><p>The Experience More and Beyond plans start at $90 and $100 per month for a single line, respectively, but you can lower that price considerably by taking advantage of AutoPay and multi-line discounts. Add four lines on the Experience More plan, for example, and it'll drop down to $42.50 per line per month. </p><p>Of course, that still isn't exactly cheap, so if you're trying to save money on your phone bill, it's worth mentioning that T-Mobile is also offering $600 off the Razr Plus (2025) when you add a line with "most plans". That could drop the price of the flip phone down to $199.99 with a cheaper (albeit less perk-heavy) data plan. The choice is yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5548" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, the phone will sport a 6.66-inch AMOLED QHD+ display.</p><p>Samsung reportedly came very close to axing the Plus model entirely. The original plan was to replace it with a Galaxy S26 Edge, a slimmer device designed to compete with the industry's obsession with thin phones. But after watching the market — specifically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-arent-meeting-expectations-report-claims">lackluster sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and the iPhone 17 Air — the company got cold feet.</p><p>In a last-minute pivot in late 2025, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">scrapped the Edge</a> and brought the Plus back from the dead.</p><p>Because this decision happened so late in the development cycle, Samsung didn’t have time to cook up new hardware. Instead, engineers had to grab what was already on the shelf.</p><p>Sources from The Elec report that the Galaxy S26 Plus will feature a 6.66-inch AMOLED screen (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-display-leak/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). If that number sounds familiar, it should. It is almost the same display size found on the Galaxy S25 Plus (6.7 inches). You get the same resolution and the same general tech, likely because Samsung opted for a "verified specification" to ensure it could hit its manufacturing targets on time.</p><p>The recycling effort doesn't stop at the display. You are also looking at a 4,900mAh battery and 45W wired charging, specs that are identical to the predecessor.</p><h2 id="the-base-galaxy-s26-quietly-benefits-2">The base Galaxy S26 quietly benefits</h2><p>While the Plus tread water, the standard Galaxy S26 might actually get a small bump. According to The Elec, the base model’s screen is growing to 6.27 inches, up from the 6.2-inch panel on the S25.</p><p>There is also a silver lining for wireless charging fans. While wired speeds are stagnant, rumors point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-s26-leak-suggests-the-plus-model-is-actually-massive">inclusion of built-in magnets for Qi2 support</a>, which could finally boost wireless charging speeds past the old 15W limit.</p><p>Production for the S26 Plus is already underway this month, with the Ultra model having a head start since December, according to the report. However, this approach might come with a sting in the tail: component costs are rising, and we might see a price hike despite the lack of major hardware upgrades.</p><p>With the Unpacked event now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">rumored for February 25</a>, and retail availability slipping into March, the S26 Plus looks like it will be a solid, if unexciting, workhorse.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The patch is rolling out for phones ranging from the Pixel 7a to the Pixel 10 series. All devices are preparing to receive the update marked as vBP4A.260105.004.E1. The main highlight of this patch is that Google is finally rolling out a fix for a series of GPU-related issues that have plagued many Pixel phones.</p><p>The post states, "General improvements for GPU performance in certain conditions" are arriving today (Jan 12).</p><p>Of course, these issues primarily concern the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">10 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">10 Pro Fold</a>. Other display fixes this month include yet another AOD (always-on display) patch for "flickering under certain conditions." This was a problem that the Pixel 10 series also struggled with quite frequently in December, following that update. Additionally, editing photos in Adobe Lightroom on the Pixel 10 would sometimes produce "noisy line flashes." This has also been fixed.</p><p>Strangely, Google states it's rolling out a fix for the Pixel 10 series' touchscreen, as some reports mentioned it would randomly stop working. This should no longer be the case after you download this update, but as always, stay vigilant.</p><p>The remainder of the January 2026 patch is as follows:</p><ul><li>Fix for noisy ringback tones experienced during Webex calls under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with battery draining in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for an issue where deleting a Live Universe wallpaper could occasionally cause the Wallpaper and style app to become unusable until the device is rebooted</li></ul><h2 id="working-through-the-issues-2">Working through the issues</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 has been struggling with its GPU since we got our hands on it, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">has been providing subtle updates</a> since September and October. It's no surprise that the series runs the Tensor G5 chip internally; however, Google's custom chip still falls short in the performance department, often failing users for high-end games. In October, users were reporting lag and freezing while gaming, leaving a sour taste.</p><p>Google reportedly promised to continue to improve and update the GPU in its Pixel 10 series, which we're seeing now in January.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that a few of its January patch fixes were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-is-getting-another-update-and-its-to-fix-some-annoying-issues">also mentioned in December</a>, such as touch issues and battery drain. Display unresponsiveness and problematic touchscreen issues were reported by Pixel 10 users, which prompted the essential mid-December update. However, it seems users are still grappling with lingering issues. January's patch will slowly begin making its rounds, and hopefully, this is the end of these problems.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When you buy a smart home device that relies on an internet connection or cloud servers for functionality, a clock starts ticking. These devices will not work forever, because eventually, the companies that made them will decide to no longer support them. Some smart home and Internet-of-Things gadgets last much longer than expect, while others will be shuttered far earlier than customers predicted.</p><p>Internet-connected devices will be discontinued at some point — this is inevitable. What happens after is uncertain. Some brands leave customers high and dry with bricked hardware and others offer refunds or store credit to allow customers to upgrade to newer (supported) models.</p><p>The best option, though, is for smart home brands to open-source the software powering discontinued hardware. This route allows the community to step in and keep their smart home gizmos running forever. After software is open-sourced, users can self-host their smart home servers, tap into platforms like Home Assistant, and leverage community projects to keep hardware out of the landfill.</p><p>A few months ago, Bose announced that its SoundTouch speakers were entering their end-of-life stage, and would stop receiving official support in February 2026. What happened next is a case study in how smart home companies should work with their customers to thoughtfully sunset products when they can't be supported anymore.</p><h2 id="bose-got-it-wrong-then-made-it-right-2">Bose got it wrong, then made it right</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9" name="bose-soundlink-plus-controls.JPG" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKGD3aMotdUmxb9HEu7ZJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speakers should theoretically last forever, but once smart functionality is in the mix, you can't take anything for granted. Bose's SoundTouch lineup of home theater speakers and soundbars were "smart" and used cloud-based features for music playback and multi-room listening. They were also <em>expensive</em>, with some models costing well over $1,000.</p><p>In its initial October 2025 announcement, Bose said that beginning Feb. 18, 2026, it would discontinue cloud support for all SoundTouch products. The hardware would no longer receive security updates, the app would shut down, and Spotify/TuneIn integration and multi-room playback would disappear.</p><p>Understandably, this wasn't received well by users, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">expressed outrage on Reddit</a> over their smart speakers turning into dumb speakers. According to the original plan, SoundTouch speakers could continue playing music over Bluetooth, Aux, or HDMI, but that was it.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1o2cnhw/bose_ending_cloud_support_for_soundtouch">Bose ending cloud support for Soundtouch</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose">r/bose</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Don't let anyone tell you collective outrage doesn't work, because Bose changed its tune last week in response to the customer complaints. The company's updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life" target="_blank">email</a> to customers said that Bose has "been listening carefully" to SoundTouch owners and is making changes accordingly.</p><p>Specifically, the cloud support shutdown date has been extended to May 6, 2026, the SoundTouch app will remain available for local control post-shutdown, and the SoundTouch API will be open-sourced for the community.</p><p>This is about as big of a win as Bose SoundTouch users could've imagined. Cloud support is still going away, but AirPlay and Spotify Connect "should continue to function," according to the company. When the cloud servers shut down, the SoundTouch app will be updated to a local version allowing users to set up, configure, remotely control, and group systems.</p><p>While some features, like cloud music services and presets, will be discontinued in May, they may not be gone for long. Bose's consumer-friendly decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://assets.bosecreative.com/m/496577402d128874/original/SoundTouch-Web-API.pdf" target="_blank">open-source the SoundTouch software</a> gives the community a chance to bring lost features back.</p><h2 id="open-sourcing-smart-home-products-is-a-win-for-everyone-2">Open-sourcing smart home products is a win for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XwDiz9UjBYDuLMtnHKr5ND" name="Nest-learning-thermostat-wiring-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat wiring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XwDiz9UjBYDuLMtnHKr5ND.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Open-sourcing the SoundTouch software always seemed like the best option for Bose. It benefits everyone. Bose can safely shut down the cloud infrastructure powering SoundTouch systems, putting that resources toward newer product lines. Meanwhile, consumers can continue to use most of their speakers' functionality, and the open-source community can help them regain — or even surpass — the lost features.</p><p>This is quite the opposite of how other companies have handled sunsetting older hardware. Last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">dropped support for the first and second-generation Nest Learning Thermostat</a> models. This effectively killed their most useful features, reducing them to "dumb" thermostats. Sounds familiar, right? It's a similar start to Bose's handling of SoundTouch speakers.</p><p>Except Google only offered owners of affected Nest Learning Thermostats $130 off the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">a new fourth-generation model</a>. It didn't make an effort to restore basic functionality or open-source the software for the community.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.83%;"><img id="vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9" name="No-Longer-Evil-Website" alt="The NoLongerEvil website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vNkL546nWbiqWJfyX5Hud9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2420" height="1714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NoLongerEvil)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As it often does, the open-source community found a way regardless. One developer Cody Kociemba, reverse-engineered the Nest API to restore certain Nest Learning Thermostat features in a project called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/codykociemba/NoLongerEvil-Thermostat" target="_blank">NoLongerEvil Thermostat</a>.</p><p>The end result is arguably the same — both Bose and Google Nest users have a makeshift solution to keep their devices running for longer — but the public perception is different. Bose seems receptive to feedback and acts like it cares about its customers, while Google's path feels more anti-consumer.</p><h2 id="the-major-players-like-google-amazon-and-samsung-should-take-notes-2">The major players like Google, Amazon, and Samsung should take notes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jSSLQeQfekhRGSeqZHpw6a" name="echo-show-10-nest-hub-max-2.jpg" alt="Echo Show 10 (right) and Nest Hub Max (left)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSSLQeQfekhRGSeqZHpw6a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div></figure><p>Companies rarely do what Bose did last week. It's uncommon for a company to make a move, actually listen to their customers, and reverse course. While Bose is still shutting down cloud support, its updated approach is a complete turnaround compared to the original plan. It's one that respects the needs of Bose as a company and the customers who spent hundreds or thousands investing in SoundTouch products.</p><p>In other words, it's a decision Bose deserves praise for having the courage to make.</p><p>It's also the blueprint for every smart home company watching this situation unfold. The next time a brand like Amazon, Google, or Samsung needs to discontinue a product, follow in Bose's footsteps. Provide users with as much local functionality as possible, and let the community do the rest by open-sourcing the software.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster made an allegation, claiming that Samsung was implementing "more new technologies" in its 2027 Galaxy S Ultra camera system. What this new technology could bring was explicitly stated, though you'd imagine it would involve photography and, potentially, videography quality.</p><p>On a hardware level, the X post stated that Samsung may implement a new sensor for the device, called "S5KHP6."</p><p>Speculation expects this to be the ISOCELL HP6, officially, as the tipster adds that it may retain the same "size" as the HP2. As SamMobile notes, if that's to be believed, then the HP6 <em>could </em>feature 200MP capabilities, likely for its main lens, on top of a 1/1.3-inch format.</p><h2 id="take-a-photo-2">Take a photo</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The size is the same as HP2.But there are more new technologies being added. https://t.co/5qJlv0MCeB<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2010323328909942863">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The timing of this rumor on social media is interesting, considering Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leaks-reveal-a-hidden-camera-boost-and-top-tier-speed">shared another report</a> about the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera. Rumors purport that the phone could receive an unlikely camera boost by way of a 24MP mode, courtesy of Good Lock’s Camera Assistant. It was speculated that, once enabled, your 24MP option will appear in the Photo and Portrait modes in the camera app.</p><p>Nothing's set in stone right now, as the tipster said Samsung was testing the waters on this idea.</p><p>Additional Samsung Galaxy S camera rumors suggest the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-bring-an-old-but-gold-camera-feature-back-in-a-future-galaxy-s">could even return an old</a> (but gold) feature: dual-aperture. It was rumored that Samsung could return "narrow" and "wide" apertures, a feature befitting scenarios where light could be a key issue. The smaller the aperture number, say f/1.8, the wider your lens, and vice versa. The report claimed that Samsung may chase this due to Apple. If this becomes a reality, there's speculation and anticipation for it on the S27 series.</p><p>Other S27 series rumors include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/if-you-want-better-samsung-facial-recognition-the-galaxy-s27-might-be-it">a "full-face" biometric scanner</a> that is, supposedly, "sptoof-resistant."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This one gives us more information about the camera specs of the foldable.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-8/">Galaxy Club</a>, the company could be sticking to the same camera specs as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this time around, meaning the Galaxy Z Flip 8 might feature a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and a 10MP selfie camera under the display. With still no telephoto lens in sight.</p><p>Before you get all disappointed, the leak also notes that Samsung may bring camera "quality upgrades" by complementing the existing camera system with new sensors, or even giving us better AI features that could boost image quality.</p><p>On the other hand, though, the Galaxy Z Flip 8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-8-could-get-makeover-with-thinner-build">might be a tad slimmer</a> than its predecessor, according to previous leaks, "significant improvements" for the Galaxy Z Flip 8 by reducing both the thickness and weight of the device by more than 10%, reaching about 5.85mm when unfolded.</p><p>Other rumors are that the next Flip will get the Exynos 2600, Samsung’s first 2nm chip, and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery, which seems like a promising upgrade from its predecessor. Despite changes to the chip and battery, Samsung might freeze the price of the Galaxy Z Flip 8,  keeping the base model at $1,099.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 didn't do as well as the Korean OEM would have expected it to, despite featuring a larger cover screen and a new Snapdragon chipset. But, the company apparently expects the Galaxy Z Flip 8 to outsell the Z Fold 8, with insiders calling it "the key to next year's increase in foldable sales."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Future Apple Intelligence features, including an AI-enhanced version of Siri, are slated to arrive on iOS this year. It's a move that wasn't unexpected, but now it's official.</p><p>It also makes perfect sense for both companies.

Yes, they sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">phones</a> and other products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review" target="_blank">watches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker" target="_blank">smart speakers</a>, but these are avenues to deliver what the company does best: software services. The more people who use these services, the more money Google stands to make because of the ways the company monetizes us through what we see.</p><p>A great way to put even more Google software services in front of even more eyes is to work through built-in native iOS features. Every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is chock full of Google software, and the company wants every iPhone and iPad to be the same way.</p><p>We've seen this all along. Google famously cut a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-seeks-to-defend-google-search-distribution-deal">deal to make its Search the default in Safari</a> until the government stepped in and said that was market abuse. The company wants every smart device, no matter who makes it, to use Google software and services.</p><p>I don't expect the all-new Siri to scream "powered by Google" in our faces, but Google will still benefit, especially behind the scenes through user data, whenever someone asks Siri anything.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-what-apple-wants-2">Why is this what Apple wants?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This side of the equation is a little more interesting. While I'm not privy to any of the details that went on during negotiations between Apple and Google, I'm certain this is exactly what Apple wants. Ask yourself a few simple questions, and you'll probably agree.</p><p><strong>Why Google? </strong>We all think of Apple and Google as rivals, and that's true in many ways. Both companies want your money and your attention, and every year they each try to one-up each other to get them.</p><p>There are also other companies Apple could have picked to power a "smarter" Siri. Apple currently uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/openai">OpenAI</a> to deliver some of its device intelligence features. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Google has a few advantages</a> in this space that make it the best choice for Apple: familiarity and scalability.</p><p>Google knows how to incorporate AI into existing smartphone features and software; it's been doing it for the past five years or so, and only made a big fuss about it when AI became the new buzzword. Gemini is a stand-alone product, but it also powers — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">directly or indirectly</a> — plenty of other Google and Android services. Google and Apple can fine-tune the way Gemini fits into AI on iOS in ways no other company can.</p><p>This will take a dedicated team, of course. Google has the means (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/alphabets-market-cap-surpasses-apples-for-first-time-since-2019.html" target="_blank">the company is worth nearly $4 trillion</a>) to build out a dream team of developers to work with Google, so Apple Intelligence and Siri are the same familiar features iOS users love, only much better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PpmajmgmLSjs36PDDam9oC" name="WWDC-2024-keynote-apple-intelligence" alt="Apple WWDC 2024 keynote presentation featuring Apple Intelligence features and descriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PpmajmgmLSjs36PDDam9oC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An even more interesting thought is that Apple can't do this itself and probably doesn't even want to. Building out the technology to power a complete AI foundation is something Apple is capable of doing, so why didn't the company just do it? Time and money.</p><p>Let's say Apple started working on building its own models and software to build out a full-stack suite of AI abilities two years ago. That means the company would still be a decade behind companies that were banking on AI tech and had pioneered it. Companies like NVIDIA and IBM. And Google.</p><p>Apple's first and biggest priority is to build great devices that people love to buy. You may not want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone </a>or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/using-mac-with-android-phone-developer-apps">MacBook</a>, but plenty of people do because they are damn good products; in some ways, they are the best products out there. This is something the company will never appear to compromise on; every initiative to increase profit margins on Apple devices is tied to the idea that they are still better than ever.</p><p>That means Apple can't just sit back and allow Siri, and even Apple Intelligence as a whole, to... well, suck (for lack of a better word). Consumers are seeing more and better, and demand more and better from their iPhones. Apple wants to give it to them so people love their next iPhone as much as they loved their last iPhone.</p><p>This all means Apple either has to buy the tech to enable its AI features to be as good or better than everyone else's, or work with a company that's already very good at it and is thirsty for a partnership. That company, you guessed it, is Google. Apple <em>saves</em> money by using Google and can still bring the features consumers want in 2026 to the table.</p><h2 id="ios-will-still-be-ios-2">iOS will still be iOS</h2><p>The next generation of iOS isn't going to turn into another Android version, no matter how much Google Gemini is inside of it. The company will still maintain strict control over everything that consumers see and do.</p><p>The difference is that by working with Google instead of a competitor or even trying to do it all itself, the newest tech when it comes to AI will be available for everyone buying an iPhone.</p><p>Both sides are winners here.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On social media, the tipster alleges that "Another product getting cancelled is the OnePlus Open 2..." This spurred some sorrow on X from replies, but the publication chimed in with some supposed information of its own.</p><p>The post claims that OnePlus has "cancelled" the global launch for its long-awaited Open 2 successor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> originally launched late in 2023, and we've been awaiting what was next from the company, even speculating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">what could be nice</a>, too. Now, leaks allege that OnePlus was in an "advanced testing stage" for the foldable before the decision was made to drop the global product altogether. Some specifications leaked, suggesting the device was preparing to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and deliver a 1TB storage variant with 16GB RAM.</p><p>A 50MP camera and a 32MP selfie lens would've captured your memories, while an 8.1-inch 2K resolution main display (6.6-inch cover) would've met your gaze.</p><p>Keep in mind: these are rumors. It's been alleged that OnePlus <em>might've </em>cancelled its foldable successor due to the sharp rise in RAM. The OnePlus Open 2 was thought to debut sometime in 2026, potentially this summer, but that might not happen.</p><h2 id="holding-out-hope-2">Holding out hope?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ndeq2mxzw4FUe39JxB2neG" name="oneplus-open-22.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndeq2mxzw4FUe39JxB2neG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been stuck in this weird two-year-long rumor phase for the OnePlus Open 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">as some reports claimed</a> it would receive an improved IPX8 rating and wireless charging.

For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> measures 4.35mm unfolded and 9.2mm folded.</p><p>Early last year, rumors surfaced, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">stating 2025 wouldn't be the year</a> for the OnePlus Open 2.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there's one thing consumers in the audio market have proven over the past few years, it's that they like hearing sound without having something in their ears. That's why bone-conduction headphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, and even smart glasses with open-air speakers have taken off. Now, audio brands are trying to figure out how to use these technologies to enhance the listening experience while sleeping.</p><p>It might sound odd to those who haven't tried it, but many people enjoy listening to white noise, podcasts, audiobooks, or music as they fall asleep. Some try to use their everyday earbuds for this purpose, which can be uncomfortable for side sleepers. Others buy a dedicated pair of sleep earbuds, like the great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-sleep-a30-hands-on">Soundcore Sleep A30</a> I previously tested. And a few just use their phone speaker under their pillow, hoping for the best.</p><p>None of these options is perfect, but Jabees is trying to provide another alternative with a Bluetooth speaker designed to go under your pillow. I've tested it, and although it's not perfect either, it seems like the best option for side sleepers who don't love wearing earbuds to sleep.</p><h2 id="how-the-jabees-peace-pillow-speaker-works-2">How the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker works</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oC5VcZhuVVEctcu4htaMGH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-7" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in the hand and on a pillow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oC5VcZhuVVEctcu4htaMGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker is small enough to fit in your hand, and that might be surprising. It certainly wasn't what I expected when this audio accessory came in the mail. After spending time with it, the pillow speaker's compact and portable size may be its biggest strength. I tend to have trouble sleeping while traveling, because my body's internal clock gets thrown off, and having a tiny pillow speaker I can bring with me for white noise or music listening sounds appealing.</p><p>It works by using a variation of bone conduction, similar to that used in bone-conduction headphones. Although it's marketed as a bone-conduction pillow speaker, that's not exactly the best way to describe it. Bone conduction headphones work by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-bone-conduction-headphones-work">sending sound vibrations through the bones in your cheek</a>, which are perceived by your inner ear. By comparison, this pillow speaker works by sending sound vibrations through your pillow, which can then be heard by your ear.</p><p>Putting aside the marketing discrepancy, the important thing is that it works. With the speaker under your pillow, it amplifies the vibrations, making them easy to hear at medium-to-high volumes. You're supposed to put the speaker under the part of your pillow where your ear is expected to rest. Location matters if you want to get the best experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5fVmxHeSKXFvwmYnCWtYCG" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-2" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in the hand showing the buttons and ports." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fVmxHeSKXFvwmYnCWtYCG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a Bluetooth speaker, but this device can also run independently using audio files stored on a microSD card. A 1GB card is included with the "plus version," and it comes with eight white noise and nature sounds. The standard version is only about $4 cheaper, so you should go with the plus bundle if you plan to use the white noise sound. Those who only want to connect to their phone can skip the microSD card and save a few bucks.</p><p>There are three yellow, high-visibility buttons for on/off and volume control. Some of these buttons serve multiple functions, like how the power button is also used for pairing, and the volume up key is used for a sleep timer. Speaking of, that feature is handy if you don't need your music to play all night — it can auto-stop after 30 minutes, an hour, or two hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nXVP4gqCuQjzNs5WTqjquG" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-6" alt="Using a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL for scale to show the size of the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nXVP4gqCuQjzNs5WTqjquG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Using a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL for scale to show the size of the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery lasts up to 10 hours, meaning you'll get a full night's sleep from the speaker, but not much more.

Charging via USB-C is pretty easy: just plug the pillow speaker in where your phone charges overnight, then wake up.</p><h2 id="it-s-better-than-your-phone-but-worse-than-sleep-earbuds-for-some-2">It's better than your phone, but worse than sleep earbuds (for some)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UAg4YirDaABJ8GGcUZFBXH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-9" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker on a pillow next to a smartphone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAg4YirDaABJ8GGcUZFBXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The price is important to keep in mind here — it's $36 for the standard version or $40 for the plus bundle with a microSD card. That should give you an idea of how the Jabees pillow speaker will sound. The quality isn't outstanding, but it blows a phone speaker away by a mile. That's because a phone speaker fires its best audio out the bottom, while this pillow speaker sends sound vibrations upward through your pillow.</p><p>When using it, you'll have to decide whether you want the pillow speaker to be discreet or loud. At a volume I'd consider comfortable, it is loud enough that someone sleeping next to you might be able to hear it. Lower volumes are less intrusive to partners, but work better for subtle white noise than for music and podcasts you need to hear.</p><p>If it's between a phone speaker and the Jabees Peace, give me the dedicated pillow speaker. As a side sleeper, I get louder volumes and enhanced clarity compared to my phone without uncomfortable earbuds in my ears. I also like being able to use my phone or set it on a nightstand while keeping the music playing under my pillow. However, it won't be for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BdbuyJpqtmwav8xVzh4ZNH" name="Peace-Pillow-Speaker-10" alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker between a pillow and a couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BdbuyJpqtmwav8xVzh4ZNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sleep earbuds still win for those who need high volume without disturbing a sleeping partner. Additionally, premium options like the Soundcore Sleep A30 have gradual morning alarms that this pillow speaker can't replicate. While it's a rare winner for side sleepers, those who sleep on their back may not be able to hear the pillow speaker well enough.</p><p>Save for those edge cases, the Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker is an intriguing option for those who need audio to fall asleep. It's particularly great for its portability, and it seems like a perfect companion for those who need extra help sleeping while traveling.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="836f074d-8bd2-43b9-a1cd-4d8ab3d133f1">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Pillow-Speaker-Sleeping-Built/dp/B0DWX3GNTV/" data-model-name="Peace Pillow Speaker" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5Sojo7mKqcsbGFe77Ghfd.jpg' alt="The Jabees Peace Pillow Speaker in a white press render."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Jabees</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Peace Pillow Speaker</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best for sleep</strong></em></p><p>This pillow speaker uses vibrations to send music through your pillow and into your ears.

It also has multiple contrast modes for reading, so you have some room to adjust the page displays to your liking.</p><p>The Colorsoft, being one of Amazon's premium e-readers, also features a pretty impressive battery life with each charge. Add in water resistance, a massive selection of titles, and a 7-inch display, and you're looking at a good discounted price on a solid device.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.34%;"><img id="faP7HXkqTeYpAckwkWoh7f" name="amazon-kindle-colorsoft-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/faP7HXkqTeYpAckwkWoh7f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1175" height="1085" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft/dp/B0CGVSKR1G" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB): $249.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's best color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft, is currently $50 off for a limited time.

For Google, this comes as a massive milestone as Gemini will now become a platform that not just powers AI on Android, but also Apple's AI future as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1340px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.75%;"><img id="NdWcdneEZ7oDXnbdEEY7h7" name="Apple-picks-Google-for-Siri" alt="Apple picks Google's Gemini for a massive Siri upgrade, ditching ChatGPT" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:1340,ch:754,q:80/NdWcdneEZ7oDXnbdEEY7h7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1340" height="814" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google News via X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">Apple's devices have OpenAI's ChatGPT </a>integrated into iOS as an optional assistant for more complex queries, rather than relying solely on Siri. That partnership gave Apple a fast way to catch up with GenAI; however, ChatGPT didn't become the foundation of Apple's devices. Things look different for Gemini as it now sits at the very core of Apple's AI strategy.</p><p>This means that Google's Gemini is no longer just Google's answer to ChatGPT or Siri; it could essentially become the underlying intelligence for both Android and iOS. This is such a big deal since Apple has always positioned itself as a company that builds everything in-house, from hardware to software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cUjcwsMsSmhRDdURybst2D" name="WWDC-2024-keynote-new-siri-animation" alt="Apple WWDC 2024 keynote presentation featuring Apple Intelligence features and descriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUjcwsMsSmhRDdURybst2D.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple's decision to utilize Google for its upcoming AI advancements subtly implies an acknowledgement that the AI race is moving too fast for even a $3 trillion company to keep up alone.</p><p>While this move is incredible for all parties involved, the post also states that Apple will continue to use its own devices and secure cloud servers to protect user data and keep things private.  This means Apple will retain control over data handling, user privacy protections, and integration with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. In short, Apple wants to leverage Gemini without giving up on its tightly controlled ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It also includes a 720p selfie camera for video calls, a privacy shutter, dual speakers, and a headphone jack out.

Gone are classic staples like the OnePlus design language, Hasselblad image processing, and the Alert Slider. Instead, you get an iPhone-inspired chassis, a new OnePlus DetailMax processing engine, and a focus on gaming and long battery life. There are some unfortunate downgrades, too, like subpar camera hardware and lower-resolution displays.</p><p>Still, if you want the newest and most powerful OnePlus phones, you'll be choosing between the midrange OnePlus 15R and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. The former costs $699, while the latter costs $899. With no 16GB RAM option for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a>, the gap between the midrange and flagship OnePlus phones is narrowing in 2026.

It's kind of an iPhone clone, ditching OnePlus' iconic circular camera housing and curved design in favor of a flat, boxy chassis. To many OnePlus fans, this is a downgrade. The squircle camera arrangement and rectangular build on the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R do little to differentiate these models from competitors.</p><p>From a durability standpoint, OnePlus is still an industry leader. It supports the standard IP68 water- and dust-resistance ratings we commonly see on Android phones, but adds the rarer IP69 and IP69K certifications, too. These add high-pressure and high-temperature liquid resistance in addition to protection against submersion. In layman's terms, these phones should survive a dishwasher run, though that's all in theory, and we wouldn't recommend trying it yourself.</p><p>Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 covers the front of each model, but the back material varies by color. Some colorways use a plastic back, and others use a Gorilla Glass 7i back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8aw47pHgzdVgNWYzkrtwGN" name="OnePlus 15" alt="OnePlus 15 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8aw47pHgzdVgNWYzkrtwGN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aligning with the new design language, the displays on the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R are completely flat.

Specifically, the OnePlus 15R might have an advantage over phones like the Google Pixel 9a and the Samsung Galaxy A56, which use lesser in-house Tensor and Exynos chips. However, despite the OnePlus 15R and OnePlus 15 both using "Gen 5" processors from Qualcomm, they're not equal.</p><p>The flagship OnePlus 15 is equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which is the successor to last generation's groundbreaking Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform. It represents even further performance gains and efficiency improvements. The phone pairs that chip with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on the configuration.</p><p>While both the OnePlus 15R and OnePlus 15 use UFS 4.1 flash storage, the former maxes out at 512GB and the latter has a 1TB variant. Additionally, the OnePlus 15R is only offered in 12GB RAM, a technical downgrade compared to the 16GB variant of the OnePlus 13R.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15R</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Oxygen OS 16 (Android 16 based)</p></td><td  ><p>Oxygen OS 16 (Android 16 based)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.83-inch flat OLED, 1272 x 2800 resolution (450 PPI), 165Hz, 1,800 nits HBM, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 </p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch flat OLED, 1272 x 2772 resolution (450 PPI), 1-165Hz LTPO, 1,800 nits HBM, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>12GB RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB, 16GB RAM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB UFS 4.1</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera 1 (Main)</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.8, 24mm</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony IMX906, 1/1.56-inch sensor, f/1.8, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera 2 (Ultrawide)</p></td><td  ><p>8 MP, f/2.2, 16mm, 112-degree FOV</p></td><td  ><p>50MP OmniVision OV50D, 1/2.88-inch sensor, f/2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera 3 (Telephoto)</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung S5KJN5, 1/2.75-inch sensor, f/2.8, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32 MP, f/2.0, 25mm</p></td><td  ><p>32MP Sony IMX709, 1/2.74-inch sensor, f/2.4, autofocus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,400mAh; Silicon NanoStack</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh (dual 3,650mAh cells) Silicon NanoStack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>80W wired, 50W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>80W/120W wired, 50W wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69, IP69K, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69, IP69K, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-glass fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-glass fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77 x 8.1 mm or 8.3 mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>213 g or 219 g</p></td><td  ><p>211g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Charcoal Black, Mint Breeze, Electric Violet</p></td><td  ><p>Infinite Black, Ultra Violet, Sand Storm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Meanwhile, the OnePlus 15R uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset, which is in a lower tier compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.

There are clear hardware downgrades, and both phones lose Hasselblad image processing. However, that doesn't always mean camera quality is worse. In fact, on the OnePlus 15, we've found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">results that are the opposite</a>.</p><p>OnePlus launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">its own DetailMax Engine</a> with the OnePlus 15, and paired with the new sensors, photo quality is generally better than the OnePlus 15. There's a trio of 50MP rear camera sensors led by the primary Sony IMX906 shooter. The telephoto camera provides 3.5x zoom natively, with up to 7x optical-quality zoom available via sensor crop.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R's camera setup is harder to defend. The primary 50MP camera is pretty good, as it uses the exact same Sony IMX906 sensor as the OnePlus 15. However, the only secondary camera is an 8MP wide-angle lens. No, you aren't imagining things — the OnePlus 13R <em>did</em> pack a 50MP telephoto lens for optical zoom, and OnePlus removed it here. That alone may make the OnePlus 15R a non-starter for some buyers.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-15r-which-one-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15 vs. OnePlus 15R: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our review of the OnePlus 15R makes one thing clear: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">this phone isn't a good value</a>. It charges more for less, and the OnePlus 13R looks like a better choice. In fact, the perplexing downgrades and even more confusing price hike make me suspicious that the OnePlus 15R only exists to push buyers to the OnePlus 15.</p><p>With only a $200 difference separating the two models, it's easy to justify paying more for a better Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a more robust camera system with a telephoto lens, and more RAM. If that was OnePlus' goal, the company achieved it. The OnePlus 15 is assuredly the better value Android phone, making the OnePlus 15R's retail price look comically inflated.</p><p>If we pretend only the OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R exist, the $900 flagship takes the crown. It has the value proposition down, challenging the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the eventual Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra while costing less. The OnePlus 15R, however, is unfit to succeed in a budget market that includes the Google Pixel 9a — a phone that's $300 cheaper at the time of writing.</p><p>Unless you're married to OxygenOS or OnePlus hardware, the OnePlus 15R doesn't make sense in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">competitive budget Android phone</a> market.

While Apple made 24MP the default with the iPhone 15, Samsung appears to be taking a more complicated approach.</p><p>For quite some time, we’ve had to pick between 12MP photos, which are quick but less detailed, and 50MP or 200MP modes, which offer more detail but come with large file sizes and slower shutter speeds.</p><p>Often-reliable leaker @UniverseIce shared on X that the Galaxy S26 Ultra, and possibly its smaller siblings, will support high-resolution 24MP photos. However, this won’t presumably be the default setting. To use it, you’ll need to find the Camera Assistant app in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> module and turn on the 24MP option in Advanced Resolution settings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:594px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.37%;"><img id="XCaXzcnLWmeZ8tn9LR5me" name="Ice Universe Galaxy S26 Ultra 24MP upgrade" alt="Galaxy S26 leak surrounding its 24MP camera upgrade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCaXzcnLWmeZ8tn9LR5me.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="594" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The source indicates this feature avoids the processing pitfalls we’ve seen in Samsung's Expert RAW app. According to @UniverseIce, the new 24MP mode gets rid of the heavy sharpening and purple fringing that often affect Samsung’s high-res photos.</p><p>After you set it up, the 24MP option should show up in your main camera interface for both Photo and Portrait modes.</p><p>Keep in mind there’s no shutter lag, so you can keep taking photos, as per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2010595080672014627" target="_blank">source</a>. But the phone needs about three seconds to process each 24MP image in the background. According to the leaker, this is a small trade-off for what they call "clearly better" image quality.</p><p>Nevertheless, the leaker claims this camera mode might not be available on older Galaxy models.</p><h2 id="performance-gets-a-bump-too-2">Performance gets a bump too</h2><p>Cameras aren’t the only thing leaking.

The full official reveal is expected in February 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It allows you to "speak" to an AI coach and create a comprehensive workout plan within minutes, incorporating dozens of different indoor or outdoor workout types. So whether your fitness goal is to lose weight, improve at a specific sport, increase muscle mass, walk more, or anything else, Gemini can give you weeks of personalized workouts for that goal. No other app is as comprehensive or customizable.</p><p>AI aside, Fitbit benefits from syncing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">cheap Fitbit trackers</a>, so the app can track stats like resting heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, sleep zones, and HRV. The new app shows "Insight" cards with trend data for these stats, so you can see how your health is improving as you try to get fitter or lose weight.</p><p><strong>Why we rely on Fitbit: </strong>"Fitbit is simple and accessible for anyone just starting out with serious workouts." <strong>— Derrek Lee, Managing Editor</strong></p><p>"I love the new interface and how simple it is to get important data at a glance.

Use <em>other</em> apps to track specific goals like miles/ steps/ weight loss/ books read, but consolidate them all into one document you can check on your phone <em>or</em> computer, using tables and drop-down menus to label your progress (as I did above).</p><p>Or, use a spreadsheet to lay out your long-term workout plans, then a specific running or strength app to put those plans into action. I used that method to plan my months-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training</a> (see above), paired with my Garmin watch, and it was highly effective.</p><p><strong>Why we rely on Google Docs/ Sheets: </strong>"Yeah, it sounds silly, but I actually found a use for spreadsheets. I need upper body strength, so lifting weights is the way I try to maintain it. I can keep record of my current routine as well as any goals, and there is plenty of room for extra notes. Best of all, I can check off each day's workout from my phone or my desktop and have access to all my long-term progress, so I feel like I'm accomplishing something." <strong>— Jerry Hildenbrand, Senior Editor</strong></p><h2 id="strava-2"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US">Strava</a></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DmS3DofztTzG4Ch28LzRhe" name="Strava-run.jpg" alt="Strava run tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmS3DofztTzG4Ch28LzRhe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2711px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="PGAe6YaYgR7vyYcXeuMH8X" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions" alt="The Strava app on the Pixel 9a display, showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PGAe6YaYgR7vyYcXeuMH8X.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2711" height="1524" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p><strong>Key Fitness Features:</strong> Activity recording, local routes with 3D maps, Heatmap, Segment leaderboards, Clubs, Challenges, long-term workout analysis, Athlete Intelligence summaries, race predictions, Instant Workouts</p><p><strong>Subscription: </strong>$12/month or $80/year (Saved routes, full data analysis with AI summaries, Instant Workouts</p><p><strong>Why Strava will help with your goals:</strong> Most people try harder when cheered on or competing with others.

One feature that stands out is what the user says is called "Bixby Live." If that sounds familiar (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>), that's because the feature works pretty similarly to Google's version, at least, in this early discovery.</p><p>When activated, it seems that Bixby Live will run a multi-colored strip along the edges of your phone's display. The center will house a circle, likely just indicating the AI's presence. At the bottom, the AI will be "listening," as well as options to mute your mic, share your camera, and upload content.</p><p>As SamMobile points out, the drop menu is purportedly signaling "conversational styles" for Bixby. Styles such as general agent, tour guide, storyteller, interview, and more.</p><p>AI generation capabilities for Bixby were spotted, as one of the Redditor's screenshots showcases a "content above was generated by AI" disclaimer. Two additional purported glimpses show off Bixby's chatting experience: one that's its main app and the other that's off the home screen. Regarding the former, it seems that users fully engaging with Bixby's app can experience a chat thread similar to what you'd get from Gemini. It even mentions "Circle to Ask," a feature that sounds incredibly similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>The other option for chatting with Bixby is a simple, semi-transparent window that appears for quick queries on your device.</p><h2 id="bixby-s-looking-to-catch-up-2">Bixby's looking to catch up</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1q7ncc2/one_ui_85_bixby_integration_with_perplexity">One UI 8.5 Bixby integration with Perplexity & Deepseek adds Bixby Live, Circle to Ask, AI generation and more</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>These supposed changes for Bixby were found in Samsung's One UI 8.5 test; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/samsung-bixby-still-hanging-on-as-rumor-says-theres-more-to-come">early signs were hinted at</a> back in October. A social media post highlighted that Samsung was experimenting with a new Bixby pop-up bar when summoned on a Galaxy device. The bar would adhere to your Light or Dark mode choice and feature a colorful blue/purple color scheme around its edges.</p><p>It definitely gives a more Gemini-esque feel to the otherwise plain and under-the-radar AI.</p><p>On a more substantial note, Samsung was recently spotted testing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-perplexity-inside-bixby-for-galaxy-s26">Perplexity AI integration</a> with Bixby. A report notes that the company was testing the AI's responses for queries given to Bixby, furthering suspicions around its potential upgrades for the full One UI 8.5 release. More than that, leaks indicate that Bixby could handle basic tasks, while Perplexity's intelligence comes in for "complex, web-backed" questions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Let's get into it.</p><h2 id="samsung-really-stepped-up-its-creaseless-foldable-game-2">Samsung really stepped up its "creaseless" foldable game</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eQZ3MJ4LpPETLA7wUy9YD3" name="samsung-display-foldable-no-crease" alt="Samsung Display's new foldable display with no visible crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:11,l:210,cw:2201,ch:1238,q:80/eQZ3MJ4LpPETLA7wUy9YD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ces-2026-samsung-shows-off-foldable-display-tech-that-may-just-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-8-a-huge-advantage"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung could be giving us a huge perk with its next foldable. The Galaxy Z Fold 8 might end up getting this creaseless panel that was shown off at CES this year. Android Central's Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda was able to compare the "reference device" — what looks to be a current-gen foldable — and the upcoming panel that seemingly looks to be creaseless. Some people even speculate that this creaseless screen will debut on Apple's rumored book-style foldable set to launch this year. <br><br>Jonnalagadda says that Samsung didn't indicate whether this panel would end up on the Galaxy Z Fold 8, but it is entirely likely that it will be the case, considering it showcased the tri-folding panels at MWC last year, and we saw it on the Galaxy Z Trifold this year.</p><h2 id="motorola-entered-ces-this-year-with-the-most-flex-2">Motorola entered CES this year with the most flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbUSzgFLRPoKhTtk7eGXeH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/meet-the-razr-fold-ces-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/unveiling-the-motorola-signature-launches-ces-2026"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Motorola outdid itself at CES this year, unveiling a whole slew of devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a>. The phone shows up with a 6.6-inch cover display like any other device, but unfolds into a massive 8.1-inch 2K LTPO display that lets the user juggle between work, creativity, and play. Motorola didn't reveal much about the device's dimensions, chipset, or other internal specs, like the RAM and battery.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Fold features an advanced triple rear camera system consisting of a 50MP Sony LYTIA main sensor, a 50MP ultrawide/macro lens, and a 50MP 3x periscope telephoto lens. It also gets two selfie cameras, a 32MP external camera, and a 20MP punch hole camera on its internal screen, for when the device is unfolded.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-signature-hands-on">Motorola Signature</a>, which is an ultra-slim device, featuring a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor, 50MP cameras, and a remarkable 5,200mAh battery—all encased in a sleek design, starting at €999, and is the first phone that is said to get upto seven years of software updates.</p><p>Other than these phones, the company also<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-things-hits-the-new-year-with-an-ultra-stylus-for-the-razr-fold-at-ces-2026"> unveiled a trio of innovative accessories</a>, including the Pen Ultra stylus for its Razr Fold, a feature-rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-the-moto-watch-and-im-glad-motorola-ditched-wear-os">Moto Watch</a> partnered with Polar, and the Moto Tag 2 tracker, promising to redefine user experience and convenience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qW8tV5W34zNPX3HP2Vs7S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="galaxy-s26-leaks-keep-leaking-with-rumors-of-a-feb-launch-2">Galaxy S26 leaks keep leaking, with rumors of a Feb launch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-launch-date-reliable-leaker-confirms"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-may-revolutionize-charging-with-new-60w-system-heres-the-scoop"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's next flagship series has been showing up in multiple leaks recently, and for good reason, considering it's due to launch sometime next month.

Blass was quoting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2006658430468239377" target="_blank">post from @UniverseIce</a>, which mentioned that Samsung will not be changing Galaxy S26 pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-entire-galaxy-s26-series-could-cost-usd50-more-than-the-galaxy-s25">as previously rumored</a>. That same post also claimed the launch will take place in San Francisco, U.S., with sales beginning in early March.</p><p>In a subsequent post, Ice Universe also claimed that the Galaxy S26 Ultra could get a huge upgrade when it comes to its fast charging system. In a post on X, the tipster claims that the phone will get support for a new 60W charging system, which will be capable of charging the phone from 0 to 75% within 30 minutes.</p><p>Backing this claim, they further stated that the tests for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's charging capabilities were conducted under Samsung's controlled laboratory conditions, using certified accessories and settings.</p><h2 id="google-is-gemini-fying-everything-from-tv-to-your-inbox-2">Google is Gemini-fying everything from TV to your inbox</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV" name="Gmail AI Inbox Demo" alt="Gmail's new AI Inbox feature in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y72tXU6LDjBkU2D7oYrFjV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-set-to-transform-your-google-tv"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/google-announces-major-gmail-gemini-powered-upgrades"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google also didn't shy away from making its own set of announcements for its products.

Strava's workouts target a wider variety of sports, and even if you can only "push" them to Apple and Garmin watches, you could easily recreate "run 3 miles in 30 minutes" on your own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>.</p><p>As a side note, I'm curious to see how well Strava's Heatmap-generated routes work. Garmin's own Trendline Popularity routing has never built especially <em>useful</em> or <em>intelligent</em> courses for me; I've always tended to make my own routes, if I use them at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-workout-plan" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Fitness tab open; it shows a customized workout plan with three upcoming runs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imq2f8NiUMqSknzNtffshN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth comparing Strava Instant Workouts to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a>, which creates custom workout suggestions across a couple dozen sports modes.</p><p>Currently in a public preview, the new Fitbit app has you speak to an LLM "coach" about your workout goals, at which point it auto-generates a week of workouts at a time. You only see one per day, but you can always "adjust plan" and change your specific workout for the day.</p><p>Fitbit doesn't have a Heatmap GPS equivalent, but its "AI" analysis is attempting something similar to Strava's Athlete Intelligence, except designed to be more of a conversation instead of Strava's per-workout summaries.</p><p>Ultimately, it's no surprise that Strava challenged other apps with its own personalized workouts. It knew it needed to be more "forward-looking" and offer more coaching value to keep its subscribers happy. And its Instant Workouts" are well-suited to Strava users, who won't want to be tied to a specific device or have to build and stick to a long-term workout plan. Always-available, tailored workouts on your phone will be more compelling to casual athletes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> was a great example of this, offering flagship specs that rivaled (and in some ways bested) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">Galaxy S23 Plus</a> but for hundreds less.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9" name="Motorola-edge-plus-2023-hands-on-display-04.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxsAXHjBz9abn2U6ZYNdm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I expect Motorola to apply the same ethos to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold">Razr Fold</a>.

While Motorola has yet to officially provide any pricing details, that would already undercut most new book-style foldables, which often start at $1,800 in the U.S. Even with the potential concern over losing a major U.S. carrier, that's still an attractive price.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some good news and bad news regarding Moto.

The company still offers one of the most affordable flip phones around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a>, which is arguably a better deal than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>.</p><p>With the Razr Fold, it can do the same, undercut its rivals, and offer something a little easier on the wallet.</p><p>Plus, Motorola still has arguably the best overall flip phone experience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">utilizing the cover screen</a> in a way that others can't or won't emulate.

They offer a unique ability to be used as a traditional phone with the added advantage of opening up to a "tablet-like" experience with a much larger display. However, they usually measure a meager 8 inches and have a more square aspect ratio, which doesn't exactly scream "tablet."</p><p>That's not to say the larger displays on these foldables aren't useful, but the experience still feels confined compared to a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p><p>As a remedy to this shortcoming, the Galaxy Z TriFold takes that concept and runs with it, opening up to a full 10-inch display. This size is on the lower end of most tablets, which are often 10 or 11 inches, while still providing a more tablet-like aspect ratio that we don't see on bi-fold foldables. The result is a more versatile experience that should proove more useful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFpW8jePa3ds2kPTRSVJf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung also took it further by letting the TriFold run a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifolds-best-feature-wont-be-its-hardware-heres-why-im-more-excited-for-dex">standalone DeX mode</a>, meaning you won't need an external display to make it work, just like on its tablets.

The Galaxy A17 5G also stands apart from other budget phones by offering six years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><p>Now, I don't need to tell you that buying a $200 phone is going to come with some sacrifices. 4GB of RAM isn't a lot, and you're limited to the 128GB storage configuration. In other words, if you're a heavy data user, the A17 may not be the best fit.</p><p>But if you want a cheap 2026 phone that <em>feels like a 2026 phone</em>, the Galaxy A17 5G is going to be a solid choice. Pull it out the next time your friends are showing off their fancy new flagships and I guarantee no one will notice the difference.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the digital data company's analytics, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-now-integrates-seamlessly-with-notebooklm-for-improved-project-management">Google's Gemini</a> has reached 21.5% of the traffic share as of January 2, 2026. What's leading the race? OpenAI's ChatGPT with 64.5% of the traffic share. There's one clear fact here, per Similarweb's data: ChatGPT and Gemini are the "top dogs," one might say, for traffic.</p><p>Among the many AI names, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini account for ~86% of the traffic. The remaining 14% is divvied up between DeepSeek, X's Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Microsoft's Copilot (in order).</p><p>Even when we get down into AI tools traffic, ChatGPT and Gemini still lead the pack, though the former holds the majority.</p><p>What's interesting about where Gemini is now is that it's been gaining ground (slowly, but surely) over the past few months. In actuality, it's been a trend all throughout 2025. Similarweb's timeline shows how Gemini's traffic share has been slowly rising, going from 5.7% a year ago to 18.2% in December 2025.</p><h2 id="gemini-v-chatgpt-2">Gemini v.

OpenAI's ChatGPT came out of left field, but it's how the general public views that Gen AI chatbot, as opposed to every other company's version. When ChatGPT debuted, it stunned and retained users, reaching 700 million monthly active users.</p><p>This is when Google started making shifts toward Gemini, and then, Apple started to wiggle itself into the mix. Here's the thing: everyone was playing catch-up. While most companies are still playing catch-up, Gemini's doing so at a seemingly faster rate, at least, per the data.</p><p>Google and OpenAI aren't slowing down one bit, as the former introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-set-to-transform-your-google-tv">Gemini features for its TV service</a>, turning it into another companion. For OpenAI, the company recently introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/health-focus-openais-waitlist-for-chatgpt-healths-dedicated-wellness-guidance-opens">ChatGPT Health</a>, a dedicated chatting experience with its AI that can help users with medical records and app data.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are two huge talking points here, so things kick off with Lock Glimpse, as Nothing is removing the feature entirely. The post states that the feature will disappear from the Nothing Phone a Series, except for the Lite.</p><p>Nothing says it has made the decision "based on feedback" and that it will only return Lock Glimpse to devices "once it’s meaningfully improved to feel less intrusive and more considered."</p><p>The other major side of this Friday update is bloatware. Nothing states users can now "fully remove" the Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Service from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-3a-lite-debuts">Phone 3a lite</a>. Entering the setting's page for the app and tapping "Disable" is how you get the ball rolling. After disabling, Nothing says your device will prompt you to restart. It adds that once this reboot concludes, "all Meta services are removed from the system partition."</p><p>The post notes that if you factory reset your device, these Meta services will return.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6" name="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yqq6GBoLLFEM9fJtcw8ZB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, Nothing is adding "app recommendations." This feature is stated to be a part of your device's setup experience; however, it may also appear "after certain updates." The post says that users can easily dismiss these notifications by swiping them away. A more permanent fix would be to disable it completely: <strong>Settings > Apps > All apps > Top-right icon > Show system > App Services > Disable</strong>.</p><p>These recommendations are headed for Nothing Phone a Series and CMF phones. The company states it's also looking to bring support for uninstalling App Services, like Meta's services, in a future OTA for more phones.</p><h2 id="solving-problems-one-at-a-time-2">Solving problems, one at a time</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5135px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="kZXcSzFUgFcN3cpBUhWTRR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZXcSzFUgFcN3cpBUhWTRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5135" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users raised their voices about a problem late last year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-dials-it-back-vows-to-give-users-a-way-to-remove-that-heavy-bloatware">the heavy bloatware</a> needs to go. Nothing faced backlash over its OS 4.0 software after users discovered instances of bloatware, such as Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services. The company highlighted that it previously only let users disable such apps, but offering a true removal option is exactly what users were chasing.</p><p>This was something Nothing alluded to during the Open Beta, stating that it would pre-install "partner apps and services" to help its BOM costs (Bill of Materials).

Fortunately, many of the best wireless carriers in the biz run special limited time offers this time of year, and the Verizon-owned Visible Wireless is no exception.</p><p>Sign up today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><strong>with the promo code SWITCH26 at checkout and you could save up to $12 per month for 26 months. </strong></a>That may not sound like a lot, but Visible's plans were already pretty affordable, so this deal could seriously alter the way you view your phone bill in 2026 (and beyond).

Using the code <strong>SWITCH26</strong> at checkout knocks $6, $9, and $12 off the Visible Basic, Visible Plus, and Visible Plus Pro plans, respectively, and the deal locks in the discounted rate for over two years with no hidden fees whatsoever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.06%;"><img id="JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z" name="visivle-app-on-phone.jpg" alt="Visible app on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JkuSbrcywuPuEMZnMT9R8Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In other words, if you use the deal to save $12 per month on the Visible Plus Pro plan, you're basically getting six months of Verizon-powered wireless for FREE across 26 months. That plan also gives you unlimited premium data on Verizon's Ultra Wideband network, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and uncapped coverage to over 85 countries worldwide.</p><p>Even if you go with one of the Visible's less comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">data plans</a>, you'll still get unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's legendary network, a free mobile hotspot, discounts on home internet, and much more.</p><h2 id="why-should-i-switch-to-visible-2">Why should I switch to Visible?</h2><p>Visible Wireless is unique in that it offers the convenience and flexibility of a prepaid carrier with the support and coverage of a Big Three provider. There are only three straightforward plans to choose from, and all three offer unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's vast 5G network. There are no hidden fees to worry about, unlimited hotspot data is a given, and the fact that Verizon owns and operates the carrier means that de-prioritization is uncommon.</p><h2 id="does-visible-wireless-have-a-free-trial-2">Does Visible Wireless have a free trial?</h2><p>Yes! Visible Wireless offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/free-trial"><strong>a 15-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore the ins and outs of its service with zero hassle or commitment.

An interview with Disney Entertainment and ESPN's EVP of product management, Erin Teague, said, "everything’s on the table" regarding these vertical videos. The original announcement said that these videos would be used to "explore" its uses across "categories, and content types, for a personalized and dynamic feed."</p><p>Disney might even look to throw in news and other entertainment tidbits throughout the day.</p><p>On a technical level, Teague said Disney is still in its early stages, as it looks to implement vertical videos in a way that doesn't feel "disjointed." However, for the user, Deadline highlights that these vertical videos could contain original short-form programming, repurposed social clips, refashioned scenes from longer-form episodic or feature titles," and more.</p><p>These videos would try and have their own backbone and not just be a "teaser" for Disney Plus' "long-form" content, such as movies and shows.</p><h2 id="getting-in-on-the-short-form-2">Getting in on the short-form</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="vvvsiZBtujJEGQMYqQtMGd" name="youtube-shorts-hero.jpg" alt="Youtube Shorts Hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvvsiZBtujJEGQMYqQtMGd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the report, one of the catalysts behind Disney's interest in vertical videos is its Gen Z and Gen Alpha users. Teague adds that, "This is what Gen Z and Gen Alpha are expecting. They are not necessarily thinking about sitting down, watching a long-form, two-and-a-half hour piece of content on their phones." More than that, Teague's response gives the impression that Disney Plus is caught in this whirlwind of engagement from other platforms with short-form, vertical videos.</p><p>You can think YouTube Shorts, Reels on Instagram, and even "Verts" on ESPN, which the publication makes note of. We shouldn't expect these vertical videos on Disney Plus anytime soon, as the company hashes out the finer details.</p><p>Aside from bringing in Hulu content more prominently on Disney Plus, vertical videos are probably the largest content shift users can expect on the service. Besides that, the card we were dealt back in September <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus/disney-plus-preparing-to-raise-prices-on-standalone-bundled-plans">was a price hike (again)</a> for its standalone and bundled plans. October 21 is when the price hikes went live for its basic with ads plan and its Premium variant. Prices hopped up by $2 to $3.</p><p>Even the Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max bundles rose from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With each charge, Google says the buds themselves will net users up to 12 hours of playtime, while intermittent charges with the case can help them last up to 48 hours between case charges.</p><p>They also have Qi wireless charging, access to SBC and AAC lossless codecs, and the latest in Google's Gemini AI features across the company's device ecosystem.</p><p>To be sure, these will probably leave something to be desired for users who don't already have Pixel devices, though they'll still offer a really crisp, clear audio profile that users will like. For $165, they do seem like a pretty appealing upgrade for those who are already within the Pixel ecosystem.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>YouTube detailed a change rolling out to its platform that involves its search filters and content discovery.</li><li>Now, users will find a new Shorts filter when searching, as well as renamed "Prioritize" and ""Popularity" options.</li><li>YouTube states that some of these options will only display popular content relevant to your query, while others cut out long-form content for Shorts.</li></ul><p>Filtering out content, on any platform, is a useful tool to have, which is why YouTube is rolling out several updates this week.</p><p>Late this morning (Jan 8), YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/400586735/changes-to-youtube-search-filters-to-improve-content-discovery">posted the details</a> regarding a content discovery update, which concerns how users interact with its search filters. When it comes to filtering out content, YouTube says it's making the process simpler this week. Two options are out: Upload Date - Last Hour and Sort by Rating. While important filtering choices, YouTube says users can achieve the same end by utilizing an "Upload Date" option and the "Popularity" filter choice.</p><p>With the house cleaning done, the more substantial portion of this update concerns new filters and some subtle changes.</p><p>YouTube states that, for "dedicated content types," it's rolled in a Shorts filter to the "Type" menu. If Shorts is selected, of course, the search results will prioritize those over long-form video content. It also makes sense that YouTube would bring Shorts here, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-shorts-five-trillion-total-views">how incredibly popular</a> they are with viewers.</p><p>As for the changes, YouTube says it's renaming the "Sort By" menu to "Prioritize." This is designed to attract more attention and hopefully drive more engagement for users looking to fine-tune their content. Second, the "View Count" filter is now "Popularity." The goal here is to help users discover video content that's hot, popping, and relevant to their initial query. Watch time and view count are taken into account during this search process.</p><p>These updates are slowly rolling out, so users may begin seeing them soon. We have not seen them appear yet at Android Central; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/08/youtube-search-filters/">9to5Google</a> has spotted them.</p><h2 id="the-content-you-want-to-see-2">The content you want to see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of refining content discovery in search results, YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-shorts-starts-a-new-dislike-test-so-it-can-better-gauge-your-interests">started a test before 2025's end</a> for Shorts. This test was in a similar vein, as the platform started testing a "dislike" button change for users. The thumbs down button was often an object of mystery for some users, so YouTube said it merged "dislike" and "not interested" into one button.</p><p>The platform said that, in its research, most users used the two buttons "interchangeably." Moreover, users weren't really sure about the differences between the two. The test would offer users one option or the other (dislike or not interested). YouTube states that users would see a short survey after hitting the thumbs-down button.</p><p>The purpose of this button is to help users weed out the type of content they'd rather not see, which can happen from time to time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We've heard a ton about the device lineup reshuffle, with the Ultra possibly showing up with four cameras; the leaks keep getting better.</p><p>The most recent one comes from reliable tipster Ice Universe, who is super certain about the S26 Ultra's new charging speeds. According to them, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could get a huge upgrade when it comes to its fast charging system. In a post on X, the tipster claims that the phone will get support for a new 60W charging system, which will be capable of charging the phone from 0 to 75% within 30 minutes.</p><p>This is incredible because, if a phone can reach that high a percentage of charge within a short span of time, it could dramatically reduce downtime for those who are stuck to their phone all day, or are travelling.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive:！Official test results for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra’s all-new 60W charging show it can charge from 0 to 75% in 30 minutes.These results were tested under Samsung’s controlled conditions.

That said, all these fast charging claims are also highly reliant on real-world factors such as ambient temperature, battery health, and device usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this leak holds, then the Galaxy S26 Ultra would definitely be a significant upgrade from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">predecessor, which supports only 45W</a> of wired charging, taking upto an hour to charge completely. Faster charging speeds have become a key factor to consider when it comes to picking a new phone, since you wouldn't want to be stuck to the plug for longer hours.</p><p>That said, the Galaxy S26 Ultra appears to be introducing some new features this year, including the rumored yet nifty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display">privacy display</a>.

This week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/">it announced</a> ChatGPT Health, "a dedicated experience in ChatGPT designed for health and wellness." The company states this new dedicated way of using ChatGPT was a direct result of how users already lean on the AI. OpenAI states, "Health is already one of the most common ways people use" the AI with "millions of people asking health and wellness questions each week."</p><p>ChatGPT Health takes into account all of your submitted wellness information to help you understand the finer details. OpenAI says users can submit their medical records and data from health apps, like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal.</p><p>As you might expect, OpenAI makes it clear that ChatGPT is not intended to <em>replace </em>your doctor; it's simply there to aid your understanding. With that in mind, after you've given the AI your records and app data, ChatGPT can help answer questions you may have about your results, set up future appointments, and offer guidance for workouts and diet.</p><p>OpenAI states that it has created ChatGPT Health alongside licensed physicians. The post states that these physicians have also encouraged OpenAI to provide different levels of the AI's responses. From how condensed information is delivered for better understanding to how urgently it should push users to seek their doctor.</p><h2 id="understand-what-matters-most-2">Understand what matters most</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ_BMwB647A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Uploading sensitive information, such as your medical records, is undoubtedly a fright for many users. To help, OpenAI says ChatGPT Health has received "foundational protections" to safeguard users' data and to give users control over it. Users will have access to temporary chats, the option to remove data from OpenAI's systems within 30 days, and more.</p><p>ChatGPT Health has also been trained not to retain users' personal information from chats.</p><p>For your medical records, the files themselves are encrypted when moving and when at rest. More than that, OpenAI says there are layered protections, as well as isolation. Essentially, conversations taking place in ChatGPT Health will "not be used" to train OpenAI's foundation models.</p><p>As previously stated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/health/waitlist?openaicom_referred=true">users can sign up</a> for ChatGPT Health's waitlist to hopefully gain entry.</p><p>OpenAI is already looking to future updates, stating, "We’ll continue to expand what you can connect and the insights Health can support—so ChatGPT can help you feel more informed, prepared, and confident as you navigate your health."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Their purpose was to discuss the company's shift, moving ChromeOS to a new Android-based stack called AluminumOS in November.

Due to its scale, dropping the software isn't possible. Software support was another object of concern, to which Maletis confirms that the 10-year commitment isn't vanishing.</p><p>He states that this shift into an Android-based stack is more of an "evolution" for ChromeOS, rather than Google phasing it out.</p><p>Toward the discussion's end, Maletis told ChromeUnboxed that there might be some variation between devices utilizing AluminumOS and the standard ChromeOS we know.

These clever cardboard contraptions have gamers start by assembling a unique controller, then using it in a bespoke game. One of these LABO kits was a VR headset.</p><p>While LABO is no longer made, the VR functionality in games like Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and several other games remains. Now that the Switch 2 is out with more powerful hardware, a higher-resolution screen, and upgraded versions of <em>all</em> these games, it makes sense to me to give them another shot in VR.</p><p>So I went and ordered the best-looking Switch 2-compatible VR headset from Amazon and got to downloading the Switch 2 updates for all the games that support VR mode. While the concept of offering hybrid VR functionality in AAA Nintendo games is an excellent concept, the execution still leaves a lot to be desired.</p><h2 id="setup-is-simple-but-it-doesn-t-get-much-better-from-there-2">Setup is simple, but it doesn't get much better from there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NQvRVR5AmWDrYq3cXwDodU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-captain-toad" alt="The STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 running Captain Toad Treasure Tracker in VR mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQvRVR5AmWDrYq3cXwDodU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above is the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2. It's one of many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=startrc+switch+2+vr+headset&crid=3NQ14XR8GXSEN&sprefix=startrc+switch+2+vr+headse%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_noss">identical-looking headset accessories</a> for Nintendo's system, and, unsurprisingly, none of them seem to be available for purchase now. At least they'll have one unit once mine is returned.</p><p>I've been a VR gamer for over a decade now and, from everything I can tell, this is as good as Switch 2 VR headsets get. It's got pads for your head and face in the right locations, adjustable lenses that can correct for IPD and mild focusing issues, and a proper place for the Switch 2 to be docked. It's better than LABO if, for no other reason, you don't have to hold it up to your face the entire time.</p><p>But that's where the positive traits end. Firing up BOTW, Mario Odyssey, or Captain Toad in VR for the first time promises to be glorious, but with this hardware, you shouldn't bother trying it at all.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LY67fJb3TrhqjnnjAVLfXU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-lenses" alt="The lenses of the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LY67fJb3TrhqjnnjAVLfXU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HYPZUDQnhdRYb4W63noKcU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-adjustment-wheels" alt="The lens adjustment wheels on the underside of the STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYPZUDQnhdRYb4W63noKcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v7z4jxCRTrHnzNPCGNyVYU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-side" alt="A STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 inserted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7z4jxCRTrHnzNPCGNyVYU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vge5X4DqgymxaxDVfQFdcU" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-inside" alt="The STARTRC VR headset for the Nintendo Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vge5X4DqgymxaxDVfQFdcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YMd2mXxKgsp43Ws5Nfby9U" name="nintendo-switch-2-vr-STARTRC-with-system-top" alt="A STARTRC VR headset with a Nintendo Switch 2 inserted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YMd2mXxKgsp43Ws5Nfby9U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I'm not someone who gets dizzy or motion sick from VR, but I could feel the head pressure immediately as soon as I put this headset on.

Now available at most big box stores in North America, the phone is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset (making it faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>), plus you get a IP69K durability rating with a stunning 6.78-inch 165Hz flat OLED display.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 also boasts a gargantuan 7,300mAh battery that provides up to three days of battery life on a single charge, and the camera tech could easily holds its own against the best devices from Samsung or Google.</p><p>So what are the downsides? Well, it makes the most sense to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">compare the OnePlus 15 with its most obvious rival</a>, the aforementioned Galaxy S25 Ultra. For starters, the OnePlus 15 only has six years of guaranteed OS upgrades compared to Samsung's seven, and the OEM has never been as interested in AI integration as Samsung and Google seem to be.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gR2eudhfwd6L3yKgEBTW3b" name="oneplus-15-display-home-screen-02" alt="A customized home screen UI on the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gR2eudhfwd6L3yKgEBTW3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> also comes with a built-in stylus and a larger display, and one could argue that the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera system is a bit more versatile than the OnePlus' tech. On the other hand, the OnePlus 15 wins out with battery life, charging speeds, and its lightweight build.</p><p>For most folks, the decision will come down to price. Is it worth spending $300 more to get marginally better AI features and software support? It's totally your call, but if you want to branch out beyond the confines of Samsung and Google and save a little cash in the process, the OnePlus 15 is the best of the best.

Colors were assigned to lights without knowing their actual spots. For example, a lamp behind your couch might shine as brightly as a ceiling light across the room, which could ruin the effect Hue wanted. Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.</p><p>Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed. Instead of treating each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-light-bulb">smart bulb</a> as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light. It then spreads colors and brightness in a way that copies how light works in real life.</p><p>The Hue app uses augmented reality and asks you to scan your room with your phone or tablet. This scan builds a model that shows where each light is, including floor lamps, wall lights, and ceiling fixtures. After that, an algorithm takes over and arranges scenes so every light fits in naturally.</p><p>If you add new lights later, just scan the area again and the room model updates on its own.</p><h2 id="nature-scenes-get-the-biggest-upgrade-2">Nature scenes get the biggest upgrade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NpE6dw8YFjh5tzWc2K8yiK" name="Philips-Hue-Spatial-Aware" alt="Philips Hue spatial aware lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpE6dw8YFjh5tzWc2K8yiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Signify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most noticeable upgrade is in Hue’s nature-inspired scenes. About half of the updated Scene Gallery will work with SpatialAware at launch, including options like Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.</p><p>In practice, if you choose a sunset-style scene, lights on one side of the room glow with warm yellows, while lights across the room turn deeper and darker. You can still use the classic scene mode if you want, but after seeing SpatialAware, the difference is clear.</p><p>Philips Hue says the feature is built for Bridge Pro users, framing it as a premium experience that leans heavily on smarter processing and room awareness.</p><p>Bridge Pro is also becoming more flexible. Now, users can combine several Bridges into one Bridge Pro setup, with the only limit being the hardware’s capacity.</p><p>Hue’s AI assistant is also getting better. Now, you can ask it to create automations using natural language, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. It’s also adding more language support and learning how to guide users to the right troubleshooting help when problems come up.</p><p>Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users. Most of the other upgrades will arrive between now and the first quarter of 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the camera experience looks identical on paper until you notice one thing: the telephoto lens and OIS system.</p><p>That 200MP telephoto sensor might be the same as last year's, but it's behind a brand-new CIPA 5.5 OIS system that delivers the best results I've ever seen from a telephoto lens. It's got incredible depth and bokeh that most phone sensors simply can't produce without using software portrait mode, and it totally changed how I took pictures with this phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-telephoto"><span>Telephoto</span></h3><p>I would normally start with the primary camera sensor in a smartphone camera review, but the telephoto is the real highlight of the experience. A new 3.7x lens means the primary sensor is used from 1-3.6x zoom, and then the telephoto takes over beyond that.</p><p>The best quality from the lens is between 3.7x and 10x, and it can be used for everything from portrait shots (which I'll go into detail about later) to macro photos and everything in between. At 3.7x, it's not a replacement for the primary camera sensor simply because that's too zoomed in to get the job done, but when you can use the telephoto camera, I recommend defaulting to it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="xHLtpQwCS99WgcuYfpWLu5" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-02" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHLtpQwCS99WgcuYfpWLu5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="M4JLNFxQFntXdfMAmV2Mr5" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-03" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M4JLNFxQFntXdfMAmV2Mr5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="8Zk8gzqa2KsTDBbqH55G86" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-4x-01" alt="Comparing 4x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro and OnePlus 15 in a science museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Zk8gzqa2KsTDBbqH55G86.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="PekApNDBCPF5iVE4gLQYh6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-10x-01" alt="Comparing 10x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro, OnePlus 15, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PekApNDBCPF5iVE4gLQYh6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.34%;"><img id="bw2DseKG3gh5MmxyAe7Nh6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-camera-sample-10x-02" alt="Comparing 10x zoom between the Honor Magic 8 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bw2DseKG3gh5MmxyAe7Nh6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The quality from the sensor is simply exquisite, with accurate color reproduction, excellent natural bokeh from the large sensor, and generally good dynamic range.

These cameras already capture plenty of detail, so the images don't need to be further sharpened, and the result can sometimes look "very digital" if you zoom in too far.</p><p>And while I've still gotten plenty of excellent shots without that problem, I'd actually encourage Magic 8 Pro users to nix the portrait mode altogether and just shoot with the 3.7x telephoto lens in normal mode.</p><p>While portrait mode will certainly improve the separation of the foreground from the background in an image, it can sometimes be too aggressive on any phone. The 3.7x telephoto sensor, on the other hand, produces incredible natural bokeh that looks like it was shot with a much larger dedicated camera more often than not. These examples prove it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

difference between using regular and portrait modes with this camera. Because portrait mode doesn't always get it right and Honor's software doesn't allow you to tweak the portrait blur in post, sticking with using the 3.7x tele on normal mode is going to produce the best shots from the phone, and honestly, the best shots from any smartphone camera I've used to date.</p><p>Some of this is down to pure sensor size, but the crispness and natural look also come from being able to capture longer exposure shots than most other phones. That CIPA 5.5 rating on the telephoto camera means the optical image stabilization is so good that the phone can shoot 5.5 stops slower than without OIS.</p><p>In plain terms, your camera shutter can stay open longer without producing a blurry image, which means it can use a lower ISO, creating noise-free shots with tons of natural detail. It also means you can freehand video from this sensor, and it'll come out looking more stable than other phones.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-main-and-ultrawide"><span>Main and ultrawide</span></h3><p>The main and ultrawide cameras on the Magic 8 Pro remain the same as the ones from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.

It's a 50MP sensor, so it packs plenty of detail into each shot, although ultrawide shots aren't typically taken with the intention of later zooming in too far. Dynamic range and colors all look great, and the 122-degree FoV ensures you'll capture everything you want in one shot.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-editing-and-ai"><span>Editing and AI</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iZgiNgBLe7WzvDyMNgSC4V" name="honor-magic-8-pro-photo-editing-01" alt="Editing photos on the Honor Magic 8 Pro using the AI-powered motion photo feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZgiNgBLe7WzvDyMNgSC4V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor continues to shore up its gallery app with new editing features, including a few interesting new ones like motion photo options and the AiMAGE color engine.

Distance zooming detail falls short of phones with additional dedicated secondary telephoto hardware like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, but the Magic 8 Pro wins in most other areas.</p><p>That's particularly true when shooting at 3.7x, which uses the giant 200MP telephoto camera and its class-leading OIS hardware. It's amazing what sorts of images this sensor was able to create, and I found that it could reliably replace my big camera for work photos on more than one occasion, which, for someone like me, is a big deal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Honor wants to change that with the UK launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on">Magic 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>The highlight is a new 200MP AI SuperNight telephoto camera. Honor combines a 1/1.4-inch sensor, f/2.6 aperture, OIS, and 3.7x optical zoom, so you get more light, clearer details, and sharper zoom shots even in tough conditions.</p><p>There’s also a 50MP main camera with OIS and a 50MP ultra-wide lens with macro support.</p><p>Honor’s upgraded AiMAGE Camera System is the technical highlight. The company says its AI adaptive stabilization makes it seven times easier to get stable zoom shots without a tripod, with a CIPA 5.5 stability rating. In simple terms, handheld night zoom shots should finally look good instead of blurry.</p><p>Color science is another area where the company is pushing hard. The new Magic Colour engine uses deep learning to process 16.77 million colors, applying device-to-cloud color migration so what you see in preview actually matches the final shot.</p><p>After you take a photo, Honor's AI Photos Agent steps in. It offers one-tap tools like AI Eraser, AI Outpainting, AI Cutout, and AI Colour to make editing faster and easier.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LSjC4Bn2a89ncXKEVDBXxS" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in gold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSjC4Bn2a89ncXKEVDBXxS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Kg9krdFGFJLBZVCtv2PuwS" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in cyan" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kg9krdFGFJLBZVCtv2PuwS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FNnG5c6XuYj2EH22UhWf7S" name="Honor-Magic-8-Pro" alt="Honor Magic 8 Pro back panel in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNnG5c6XuYj2EH22UhWf7S.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="dedicated-ai-button-for-the-camera-2">Dedicated AI button for the camera</h2><p>There’s a dedicated AI Button, separate from the power key, that opens the camera instantly with a double press, even if the screen is locked.

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>As Honor has evolved over the years from a value brand to a premium one, its phone designs and specs have followed suit. We've seen the brand push out foldables that rival Samsung's best, the strongest ingress protection next to OnePlus, cameras that would make an iPhone blush, and OLED displays that eclipse the best from every brand.</p><p>That pedigree continues with a new level of excellence on the Honor Magic 8 Pro, a new flagship that launches globally on January 8, 2026, and brings along an OLED panel with a bevy of accessibility features, custom user-level calibration, the best eye care solutions we've yet seen, and a brightness level that'll blow you away.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15's display</a> impressed us with its ultrafast refresh rate, Honor is focusing more on brightness and accessibility solutions for the Magic 8 Pro's display, and it comes out on top for most people because of it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-comfort-and-brightness"><span>Comfort and brightness</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WL6ssm1tdTI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>When I first learned I was sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> in spring 2023, phones from brands like Honor, OnePlus, and Motorola were the first to offer alternatives that worked. Since then, Honor has doubled down on the eye-friendly nature of its displays, adopting better dimming methods as the default, faster PWM dimming than most other manufacturers, tons of bespoke eyecare solutions, and more.</p><p>Because of this focus, the Magic 8 Pro is the new gold standard for overall flagship display quality <em>and</em> comfort. It's funny to have a new winner so closely after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-display-review">OnePlus 15</a>, but this is how the smartphone industry works sometimes.</p><p>That all starts with a combination of class-leading peak brightness and a bevy of eyecare solutions that genuinely help people who need them. Out of the box, the Magic 8 Pro uses a comfortable single-pulse DC dimming method from 21-100% brightness. A user-selectable option for Honor's alternative "comfort" triple-pulse method is found under the Honor Eye Care Display section in settings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rwxpC4Ctfm95wLcSE4rpLm" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-dimming" alt="An infographic of the Honor Magic 8 Pro's dimming options, including measured graphs of the brightness and dimming waves plus an image of each brightness level taken at 1/6400 shutter speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwxpC4Ctfm95wLcSE4rpLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2916" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the names, I find the "classic" mode to be far more comfortable than the "comfort" dimming option. Modulation is impressively low overall, and high-frequency PWM dimming at 20% brightness and below ensures substantial comfort even for sensitive users.</p><p>On top of being comfortable, this panel is the brightest I've measured on any smartphone to date by around 10%. Not only that, but I've found that the HDR contrast on this display looks noticeably better than phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> when viewed under sunlight.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dZu3n5ZjxTyP89JFRZHdp4" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-reflectivity-01" alt="Viewing an HDR picture of capybaras on the Google Photos app in the sunlight on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Honor Magic 8 Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZu3n5ZjxTyP89JFRZHdp4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aY2tgEcET5pNAS7njNKTs4" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-review-reflectivity-02" alt="Viewing an HDR picture of capybaras on the Google Photos app in the sunlight on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, Honor Magic 8 Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aY2tgEcET5pNAS7njNKTs4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Magic 8 Pro doesn't feature the same anti-glare layer that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-display-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> does. That means reflections in sunlight will lower the contrast ratio of the overall image, but Honor's display does an excellent job of making up for that.</p><p>At around 3,600 nits of actual, measured HDR brightness, this display pumps out the nits needed to be visible outside and still provides a contrast ratio that looks OLED good. To put that in perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> hits 2,600 nits of peak brightness, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL tops out around 3,300 nits.</p><p>To make those numbers even more impressive, Honor doesn't use nasty PWM dimming at high brightness, so your display isn't strobing your brain with these high brightness values, unlike Samsung and Google. That shows companies can make bright displays that are still comfortable to use.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-accessibility"><span>Accessibility</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7YXUPrVGgHFB2BMEkeib35" name="honor-magic-8-pro-custom-display" alt="The custom display setting on the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YXUPrVGgHFB2BMEkeib35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 10 Pro debuts Honor's "Custom Display" calibration options, including automatic contrast, brightness, and color adjustments to best fit you as an individual. Custom Display breaks this into two tests to tailor the display to your needs.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, my test yielded the "high sensitivity" result, which keeps the brightness a bit dimmer than the default curve and also adjusts contrast to better fit sensitive eyes. A new, scalable Extra Dim option, found under accessibility settings, can further reduce brightness without greatly affecting modulation.</p><p>The Magic 8 Pro's display also supports the company's unique accessibility settings like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Defocus Eyecare</a>, plus additional accessibility options for hardware-level blue light blocking, a circadian rhythm mode that adjusts the display temperature throughout the day, ambient light temperature adjustment, a motion sickness mode, and a circularly polarized light filter built in for comfort.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yWgArjnH84YR2WsrFCP4YC" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-03" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro with a colorful wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWgArjnH84YR2WsrFCP4YC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This one's a true 10-bit display that doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">color dithering</a> in the default vibrant color mode. Temporal dithering is yet another ridiculous way manufacturers have found to simulate better image quality at the expense of sensitive users.</p><p>Honor isn't pushing any boundaries with the 120Hz refresh rate, but it's an LTPO panel, which means it can drop as low as 1Hz when needed. That's great for people who love to use the always-on display, especially since Honor provides a <em>true</em> always-on display that won't turn off if you don't want it to.</p><p>Additionally, I've found that the Magic 8 Pro's display resolution does a great job of selecting high resolution (2808 x 1256) when necessary. That makes games look nice and crisp, something that's important if you like distance sniping in games like Fortnite.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-launch-of-a-brand-new-tool"><span>The launch of a brand new tool</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e6BQbtSUqtxHmKxJVgEWoF" name="honor-magic-8-pro-flicker-detection-tool" alt="The new flicker detection tool on the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e6BQbtSUqtxHmKxJVgEWoF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's new flicker-detection tool built into the phone speaks directly to me and anyone else concerned about flickering lights in their life. Found under the Honor Eye Comfort Display settings section, the new flicker-detection tool can be used to do exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Results are displayed in a standardized IEEE 1789-2015 graph, including an easy-to-understand result that doesn't require you to know anything about the lighting industry's flicker standards. You'll get a quick good/moderate/bad result with enough data to help you make positive changes, if need be.</p><p>The inclusion of this tool is a testament to how seriously Honor is taking the serious problem of flickering lights, and it means that all users of this phone can swap out the nasty flickering lights that cause some people debilitating pain. This tool <em>only</em> works on lights right now, though, and doesn't seem to work on displays, so there's room for future improvement, too.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-verdict"><span>Verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Tx3wQvBdasuyRTJL2KtDoC" name="honor-magic-8-pro-display-01" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro with a space wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tx3wQvBdasuyRTJL2KtDoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is the flagship phone that feels like it finally doesn't compromise on anything, including a class-leading display. From impressively accurate color reproduction and brightness, to accessibility options that ensure even sensitive users don't get left behind, this is a phone that aims to be the best for everyone who wants one.</p><p>It's even more impressive that Honor launched the industry's first built-in flicker detection tool with this phone, completing the circle of catering to individuals who are sensitive to the overly bright, flickering displays and LED lights that are increasingly more common in our lives. It's a huge deal that a company like Honor is recognizing these problems and developing solutions to them, and it makes recommending the Honor Magic 8 Pro incredibly easy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This allowed users to send and receive files between an iPhone and a Pixel 10 device using Android 16's native Quick Share feature without any workarounds. After keeping the feature exclusive to the Pixel 10 series for over a month, Google now seems to be expanding support to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><h2 id="pixel-9-looks-next-in-line-for-airdrop-support-2">Pixel 9 looks next in line for AirDrop support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.77%;"><img id="iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY" name="google-apple-quick-share-airdrop-update" alt="Google's Pixel 10 series can now use Quick Share to send files to users with an iPhone's AirDrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="860" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google released a new Android Canary build on January 8, 2026. While the update does not introduce many user-facing features, it adds the same system files that enabled Quick Share and AirDrop cross-sharing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> to the Pixel 9 firmware.</p><p>The change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-airdrop-quick-share-support-android-canary-3630861/">Android Authority</a>, which reports that these files are not present on the mid-range Pixel 9a and are limited to the Pixel 9 and higher-end Pixel 9 Pro models.</p><p>The files are also missing from older Pixel models like the Pixel 8 and Pixel 7 series. That does not necessarily mean those devices will never receive AirDrop and Quick Share interoperability, but it suggests Google is not ready to enable the feature on them just yet. Google has previously stated that support for older Pixel phones will arrive at a later date.</p><p>For now, the feature does not actually work on the Pixel 9 series despite the files being present, indicating Google still needs to enable the functionality on its end. It is possible the company is targeting a future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-starts-rolling-out-android-16-qpr3-beta-1-1-is-rolling-out-with-an-important-fix">Android 16 QPR3</a> update, or it could delay the feature until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a>. We will share more details as they become available.</p> ]]></dc:content>
